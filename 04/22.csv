recommendation algorithm, which considers social tags as an important role for
information retrieval. Besides its low cost of computational time, the
experiment results of two real-world data sets, \emph{Del.icio.us} and
\emph{MovieLens}, show it can enhance the algorithmic accuracy and diversity.
Especially, it can obtain more personalized recommendation results when users
have diverse topics of tags. In addition, the numerical results on the
dependence of algorithmic accuracy indicates that the proposed algorithm is
particularly effective for small degree objects, which reminds us of the
well-known \emph{cold-start} problem in recommender systems. Further empirical
study shows that the proposed algorithm can significantly solve this problem in
social tagging systems with heterogeneous object degree distributions.

$r$-graph with $n\geq n_0(\alpha,\epsilon,t)$ vertices and density at least
$\alpha+\epsilon$ contains a subgraph on $t$ vertices of density at least
$\alpha+c$. The Erd\H os--Stone--Simonovits theorem implies that for $r=2$
every $\alpha\in [0,1)$ is a jump. Erd\H os showed that for all $r\geq 3$,
every $\alpha\in [0,r!/r^r)$ is a jump. Moreover he made his famous ""jumping
constant conjecture"" that for all $r\geq 3$, every $\alpha \in [0,1)$ is a
jump. Frankl and R\""odl disproved this conjecture by giving a sequence of
values of non-jumps for all $r\geq 3$. We use Razborov's flag algebra method to
show that jumps exist for $r=3$ in the interval $[2/9,1)$. These are the first
examples of jumps for any $r\geq 3$ in the interval $[r!/r^r,1)$. To be precise
we show that for $r=3$ every $\alpha \in [0.2299,0.2316)$ is a jump. We also
give an improved upper bound for the Tur\'an density of
$K_4^-=\{123,124,134\}$: $\pi(K_4^-)\leq 0.2871$. This in turn implies that for
$r=3$ every $\alpha \in [0.2871,8/27)$ is a jump.

inflaton field over Hubble-patch sized domains. The averaged field then obeys a
Langevin-type equation into which short-scale fluctuations enter as a noise
term. We solve the Langevin equation for a inflaton field with Dirac Born
Infeld (DBI) kinetic term perturbatively in the noise and use the result to
determine the field value's Probability Density Function (PDF). In this
calculation, both the shape of the potential and the warp factor are arbitrary
functions, and the PDF is obtained with and without volume effects due to the
finite size of the averaging domain. DBI kinetic terms typically arise in
string-inspired inflationary scenarios in which the scalar field is associated
with some distance within the (compact) extra dimensions. The inflaton's
accessible range of field values therefore is limited because of the extra
dimensions' finite size. We argue that in a consistent stochastic approach the
distance-inflaton's PDF must vanish for geometrically forbidden field values.
We propose to implement these extra-dimensional spatial restrictions into the
PDF by installing absorbing (or reflecting) walls at the respective boundaries
in field space. As a toy model, we consider a DBI inflaton between two
absorbing walls and use the method of images to determine its most general PDF.
The resulting PDF is studied in detail for the example of a quartic warp factor
and a chaotic inflaton potential. The presence of the walls is shown to affect
the inflaton trajectory for a given set of parameters.

The mean radial velocity of the cluster is -29.11+/-0.85 km/s. Using both
radial velocities and proper motions we found 35 cluster's members, among which
12 are likely cluster's close binary systems. One star may have a sub-stellar
companion, requiring a more intensive follow-up. Our results are in good
agreement with past radial velocity and photometric measurements. Furthermore,
using our photometry, astrometry and spectroscopy we identified a new sub-giant
branch eclipsing binary system, member of the cluster. The cluster's close
binary frequency at 29% +/- 9% (34% +/-10% once including long period
binaries), appears higher than the field binary frequency equal to (22% +/- 5%,

three transiting planetary candidates the brightest one (V=15.26) is worth to

ostensibly unphysical. We provide analytic expressions for estimating the
disturbance to the various light-curve parameters as a function of the
integration time. These effects are particularly crucial in light of the
long-cadence photometry often used for discovering new exoplanets by, for
example, Convection Rotation and Planetary Transits (COROT) and the Kepler
Mission (8.5 and 30 min). One of the dominant effects of long integration times
is a systematic underestimation of the light-curve-derived stellar density,
which has significant ramifications for transit surveys. We present a
discussion of numerical integration techniques to compensate for the effects
and produce expressions to quickly estimate the errors of such techniques, as a
function of integration time and numerical resolution. This allows for an
economic choice of resolution before attempting fits of long-cadence
light-curves. We provide a comparison of the short- and long-cadence

field of the Kepler Mission, KIC J192410.81+445934.9. This system was
identified during a search for compact pulsators in the Kepler field.
High-speed photometry reveals coherent large-amplitude variability with a
period of 2.94 h. Rapid, large-amplitude quasi-periodic variations are also
detected on time scales of ~1200 s and ~650 s. Time-resolved spectroscopy
covering one half photometric period shows shallow, broad Balmer and He I
absorption lines with bright emission cores as well as strong He II and Bowen
blend emission. Radial velocity variations are also observed in the Balmer and
He I emission lines that are consistent with the photometric period. We
therefore conclude that KIC J192410.81+445934.9 is a nova-like variable of the
UX UMa class in or near the period gap, and it may belong to the rapidly
growing subclass of SW Sex systems. Based on 2MASS photometry and companion
star models, we place a lower limit on the distance to the system of ~500 pc.
Due to limitations of our discovery data, additional observations including
spectroscopy and polarimetry are needed to confirm the nature of this object.
Such data will help to further understanding of the behavior of nova-like
variables in the critical period range of 3-4 h, where standard cataclysmic
variable evolutionary theory finds major problems. The presence of this system
in the Kepler mission field-of-view also presents a unique opportunity to
obtain a continuous photometric data stream of unparalleled length and
precision on a cataclysmic variable system.

fundamental scale in any consistent D-dimensional theory of gravity is not the
Planck length l_D, but rather the species scale L_N = N^1/(D-2) l_D. Using this
fact, we derive the bound on semi-classical black hole entropy in any
consistent theory of gravity as S > N, which when applied to string theory
provides additional evidence for the former relation. This counting also shows
that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can be viewed as the entanglement entropy,
without encountering any puzzle of species. We demonstrate that the counting of
species extends to the M-theory limit. The role of the species scale is now
played by the eleven-dimensional Planck length, beyond which resolution of
distances is gravitationally-impossible. The conclusion is, that string theory
is a theory of species and gets replaced by a pure gravitational theory in the
limit when species become strongly coupled and decouple.

explore the dependence of the resulting dynamics and the characteristics of the
derived X-ray emission on numerical conduction and viscosity. For the purpose
of our investigation we present models of colliding flow with plane-parallel
and cylindrical divergence. Numerical conduction causes erroneous heating of
gas across the contact discontinuity which has implications for the rate at
which the gas cools. We find that the dynamics of the shocked gas and the
resulting X-ray emission are strongly dependent on the contrast in the density
and temperature either side of the contact discontinuity, these effects being
strongest where the postshock gas of one flow behaves quasi-adiabatically while
the postshock gas of the other flow is strongly radiative. Introducing
additional numerical viscosity into the simulations has the effect of damping
the growth of instabilities, which in some cases act to increase the volume of
shocked gas and can re-heat gas via sub-shocks as it flows downstream. The
resulting reduction in the surface area between adjacent flows, and therefore
of the amount of numerical conduction, leads to a commensurate reduction in
spurious X-ray emission, though the dynamics of the collision are compromised.
The simulation resolution also affects the degree of numerical conduction. A
finer resolution better resolves the interfaces of high density and temperature
contrast and although numerical conduction still exists the volume of affected
gas is considerably reduced. However, since it is not always practical to
increase the resolution, it is imperative that the degree of numerical
conduction is understood so that inaccurate interpretations can be avoided.
This work has implications for the dynamics and emission from astrophysical
phenomena which involve high Mach number shocks.

  Quant Congress USA",,,,"q-fin.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper describes a flexible and tractable bottom-up dynamic correlation
modelling framework with a consistent stochastic recovery specification. The
stochastic recovery specification only models the first two moments of the spot
recovery rate as its higher moments have almost no contribution to the loss
distribution and CDO tranche pricing. Observing that only the joint
distribution of default indicators is needed to build the portfolio loss
distribution, we propose a generic class of default indicator copulas to model
CDO tranches, which can be easily calibrated to index tranche prices across
multiple maturities. This correlation modelling framework has the unique
advantage that the joint distribution of default time and other dynamic
properties of the model can be changed separately from the loss distribution
and tranche prices. After calibrating the model to index tranche prices,
existing top-down methods can be applied to the common factor process to
construct very flexible systemic dynamics without changing the already
calibrated tranche prices. This modelling framework therefore combines the best
features of the bottom-up and top-down models: it is fully consistent with all
the single name market information and it admits very rich and flexible spread
dynamics. Numerical results from a non-parametric implementation of this
modelling framework are also presented. The non-parametric implementation
achieved fast and accurate calibration to the index tranches across multiple
maturities even under extreme market conditions. A conditional Markov chain
method is also proposed to construct the systemic dynamics, which supports an
efficient lattice pricing method for dynamic spread instruments. We also showed
how to price tranche options as an example of this fast lattice method.

gas-rich disk galaxies which fell together with an initial pericentric
separation of ~2 disk scale lengths approximately 620 Myr ago. Results from two
different star formation rules--- density-dependent and shock-induced--- show
significant differences in star formation during and after the first passage.
Shock-induced star formation yields a prompt and wide-spread starburst at the
time of first passage, while density-dependent star formation predicts a more
slowly rising and centrally concentrated starburst. A comparison of the
distributions and ages of observed clusters with results of our simulations
favors shock-induced mechanism of star formation in NGC 7252. We also present
simulated color images of our model of NGC 7252, constructed by incorporating
population synthesis with radiative transfer and dust attenuation. Overall the
predicted magnitudes and colors of the models are consistent with observations,
although the simulated tails are fainter and redder than observed. We suggest
that a lack of star formation in the tails, reflected by the redder colors, is
due to an incomplete description of star formation in our models rather than

frustration nor low-dimensionality are prerequisites. We present a microscopic

calculations, we find two relevant couplings in this system: an
antiferromagnetic coupling J_c, forming spiral chains along the hexagonal c

dimers. To refine the J_c and J_d values and to confirm the proposed spin
model, we perform quantum Monte-Carlo simulations for the dioptase spin

the sublattice magnetization are in remarkably good agreement with the
experimental data. The refined model parameters are J_c = 78 K and J_d = -37 K

stellar irradiation. We find that the disc opacity plays a vital role in
determining whether a disc fragments. Specifically, opacities that are smaller
than interstellar Rosseland mean values promote fragmentation (even at small
radii, R < 25AU) since low opacities allow a disc to cool quickly. This may
occur if a disc has a low metallicity or if grain growth has occurred. With
specific reference to the HR 8799 planetary system, given its star is
metal-poor, our results suggest that the formation of its imaged planetary
system could potentially have occurred by gravitational instability. We also
find that the presence of stellar irradiation generally acts to inhibit
fragmentation (since the discs can only cool to the temperature defined by
stellar irradiation). However, fragmentation may occur if the irradiation is
sufficiently weak that it allows the disc to attain a low Toomre stability
parameter.

terms of the projected phase-space density using a phenomenological, fully
anisotropic model of the distribution function. We apply the Markov Chain Monte
Carlo approach to place constraints on total mass distribution approximated by
the universal NFW profile and the profile of the anisotropy of galaxy orbits.
We find the normalization of the mean mass-concentration relation is
c=6.9_{-0.7}^{+0.6} at the virial mass M_v=5x10^{14}M_sun. Assuming a
one-to-one correspondence between sigma_8 and the normalization of the
mass-concentration relation in the framework of the concordance model we
estimate the normalization of the linear power spectrum to be
sigma_8=0.91_{-0.08}^{+0.07}. Our constraints on the parameters of the mass
profile are compared with estimates from other methods. We show that galaxy
orbits are isotropic at the cluster centres (with the mean ratio of the
radial-to-tangential velocity dispersions sigma_r/sigma_theta=0.97+/-0.04) and
radially anisotropic at the virial sphere (with the mean ratio
sigma_r/sigma_theta=1.75^{+0.23}_{-0.19}). Although the value of the central
anisotropy appears to be universal, the anisotropy at the virial radius differs
between clusters within the range 1<(sigma_r/sigma_theta)<2. Utilizing the
Bautz-Morgan morphological classification and information on the prominence of
a cool core we select two subsamples of galaxy clusters corresponding to less
and more advanced evolutionary states. It is demonstrated that less evolved
clusters have shallower mass profiles and their galaxy orbits are more radially
biased at the virial sphere. This property is consistent with the expected
evolution of the mass profiles as well as with the observed orbital segregation
of late and early type galaxies.

changes black hole's geometry only softly, the emission of gravitons is
suppressed by many orders even at quite small values of the GB coupling. The
huge suppression of the graviton emission is due to the multiplication of the
two effects: the quick cooling of the black hole when one turns on the GB
coupling and the exponential decreasing of the grey-body factor of the tensor
type of gravitons at small and moderate energies. At higher $D$ the tensor
gravitons emission is dominant, so that the overall lifetime of black holes

are combined with the significantly (2 mags) deeper monochromatic images from
the public SDSS Stripe82 to extract, through careful visual inspection, a
robust sample of nearby, luminous ETGs, including a subset of ~70 peculiar

while 7% show evidence of dust lanes and patches. The peculiar ETG population
is found to preferentially inhabit low-density environments (outskirts of
clusters, groups or the field). An analysis of optical emission-line ratios
indicates that the fraction of peculiar ETGs that are Seyferts or LINERs
(19.4%) is twice the corresponding values in their relaxed counterparts
(10.1%). LINER-like emission is the dominant type of nebular activity in all

star formation. An analysis of UV-optical colours indicates that, regardless of
the luminosity range being considered, the fraction of peculiar ETGs that have
experienced star formation in the last Gyr is a factor of ~1.5 higher than that
in their relaxed counterparts. The spectro-photometric results strongly suggest
that the interactions that produce the morphological peculiarities also induce

group galaxies provide an unprecedented opportunity to reveal the effects of
asymmetry on observables, particularly optical spectra. Scattering dust at
different locations on the light echo ellipsoid witnesses the supernova from
different perspectives and the light consequently scattered towards Earth
preserves the shape of line profile variations introduced by asymmetries in the
supernova photosphere. However, the interpretation of supernova light echo
spectra to date has not involved a detailed consideration of the effects of
outburst duration and geometrical scattering modifications due to finite

performing single particle measurements on some many-body entangled state,
known as the resource state. As single particle measurements are relatively
easy to implement, the preparation of the resource state becomes a crucial
task. An appealing approach is simply to cool a strongly correlated quantum
many-body system to its ground state. In addition to requiring the ground state
of the system to be universal for one-way quantum computing, we also want the
Hamiltonian to have non-degenerate ground state protected by a fixed energy
gap, to involve only two-body interactions, and to be frustration-free so that
measurements in the course of the computation leave the remaining particles in
the ground space. Recently, significant efforts have been made to the search of
resource states that appear naturally as ground states in spin lattice systems.
The approach is proved to be successful in spin-5/2 and spin-3/2 systems. Yet,
it remains an open question whether there could be such a natural resource
state in a spin-1/2, i.e., qubit system. Here, we give a negative answer to
this question by proving that it is impossible for a genuinely entangled qubit
states to be a non-degenerate ground state of any two-body frustration-free
Hamiltonian. What is more, we prove that every spin-1/2 frustration-free
Hamiltonian with two-body interaction always has a ground state that is a
product of single- or two-qubit states, a stronger result that is interesting

history of protostars and in principle provides a powerful tool for
observationally distinguishing different protostellar accretion models. We
consider three basic models here: the Isothermal Sphere model (Shu 1977), the
Turbulent Core model (McKee & Tan 2003), and an approximate representation of
the Competitive Accretion model (Bonnell et al. 1997, 2001a). We also consider
modified versions of these accretion models, in which the accretion rate tapers
off linearly in time. Finally, we allow for an overall acceleration in the rate
of star formation. At present, it is not possible to directly determine the PMF
since protostellar masses are not currently measurable. We carry out an
approximate comparison of predicted PMFs with observation by using the theory
to infer the conditions in the ambient medium in several star-forming regions.
Tapered and accelerating models generally agree better with observed
star-formation times than models without tapering or acceleration, but
uncertainties in the accretion models and in the observations do not allow one
to rule out any of the proposed models at present. The PMF is essential for the
calculation of the Protostellar Luminosity Function, however, and this enables
stronger conclusions to be drawn (Offner & McKee 2010).

investigate the chemical abundance trends of stars in simulated stellar halos
as a function of their origin. These simulations employ a physically motivated
supernova feedback recipe, as well as metal enrichment, metal cooling and metal
diffusion. As presented in an earlier paper, the simulated galaxies in this
study are surrounded by stellar halos whose inner regions contain both stars
accreted from satellite galaxies and stars formed in situ in the central
regions of the main galaxies and later displaced by mergers into their inner
halos. The abundance patterns ([Fe/H] and [O/Fe]) of halo stars located within
10 kpc of a solar-like observer are analyzed. We find that for galaxies which
have not experienced a recent major merger, in situ stars at the high [Fe/H]
end of the metallicity distribution function are more [alpha/Fe]-rich than
accreted stars at similar [Fe/H]. This dichotomy in the [O/Fe] of halo stars at
a given [Fe/H] results from the different potential wells within which in situ
and accreted halo stars form. These results qualitatively match recent
observations of local Milky Way halo stars. It may thus be possible for
observers to uncover the relative contribution of different physical processes
to the formation of stellar halos by observing such trends in the halo
populations of the Milky Way, and other local L* galaxies.

  Distribution",,,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn nlin.AO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A certain complexity threshold is proposed which defines the term `complex
network' for RSN, e.g. Kauffman networks with s>=2 - more than two equally
probable state variants. Such Kauffman networks are no longer Boolean networks.
RSN are different than RWN and RNS. This article is the second one of three
steps in description of `structural tendencies' which are an effect of adaptive
evolution of complex RSN. This complexity threshold is based on the appearances
of chaotic features of a network during its random growth and disappearance of
small network effects. Distribution of damage size (after small disturbance)
measured in a fraction of damaged nodes, or in number of damaged external
outputs and degree of chaos is investigated using simulation. It is done during
growth (up to N=4000 nodes) for different: network types (including
scale-free), numbers of node inputs (K=2,3,4, fixed for a network) and numbers
of signal variants (s=2,3,4,16). In this distribution two peaks emerge and
in-between them there appears an area of zero frequency - this is the best
practical criterion of complexity threshold found in the investigation. No
critical points are found in the area of emerging complexity. A special
simplified algorithm (`reversed-annealed') is used which omits the problem of
circular attractors. The investigated `transition' to chaos in respect to N is
different from the known phase transition near K=2 for s=2.

turbulence with nonzero cross helicity is often called imbalanced, as it
implies that the energies of Alfv\'en fluctuations propagating parallel and
anti-parallel the background field are not equal. Recent analytical and
numerical studies have revealed that at every scale, MHD turbulence consists of
regions of positive and negative cross helicity, indicating that such
turbulence is inherently locally imbalanced. In this paper, results from high
resolution numerical simulations of steady-state incompressible MHD turbulence,
with and without cross helicity are presented. It is argued that the inertial
range scaling of the energy spectra (E^+ and E^-) of fluctuations moving in
opposite directions is independent of the amount of cross-helicity. When cross
helicity is nonzero, E^+ and E^- maintain the same scaling, but have differing
amplitudes depending on the amount of cross-helicity.

rise to dissipation and drag. Weak shocks, i.e., those of small amplitude, can

strong shocks are discontinuous within hydrodynamics and therefore probe the
microscopics of the theory. In this paper we consider the case of the strongly
coupled N=4 plasma whose microscopic description, applicable for scales smaller
than the inverse temperature, is given in terms of gravity in an asymptotically
$AdS_5$ space. In the gravity approximation, weak and strong shocks should be
described by smooth metrics with no discontinuities. For weak shocks we find
the dual metric in a derivative expansion and for strong shocks we use
linearized gravity to find the exponential tail that determines the width of
the shock. In particular we find that, when the velocity of the fluid relative
to the shock approaches the speed of light $v\to 1$ the penetration depth
$\ell$ scales as $\ell\sim (1-v^2)^{1/4}$. We compare the results with second
order hydrodynamics and the Israel-Stewart approximation. Although they all

concentrations from underdoped to overdoped regions of the phase diagram (0.038
< x < 0.127). A residual linear term k_c0/T is observed in the T = 0 limit when
the current is along the c axis, revealing the presence of nodes in the gap.
Because the nodes appear as x moves away from the concentration of maximal T_c,
they must be accidental, not imposed by symmetry, and are therefore compatible
with an s_{+/-} state, for example. The fact that the in-plane residual linear
term k_a0/T is negligible at all x implies that the nodes are located in
regions of the Fermi surface that contribute strongly to c-axis conduction and
very little to in-plane conduction. Application of a moderate magnetic field
(e.g. H_c2/4) excites quasiparticles that conduct heat along the a axis just as
well as the nodal quasiparticles conduct along the c axis. This shows that the
gap must be very small (but non-zero) in regions of the Fermi surface which
contribute significantly to in-plane conduction. These findings can be
understood in terms of a strong k dependence of the gap Delta(k) which produces
nodes on a Fermi surface sheet with pronounced c-axis dispersion and deep
minima on the remaining, quasi-two-dimensional sheets.

<10^6 years and to newly identified asteroid pairs with ages <5x10^5 years. We
have identified three S-complex asteroid clusters with ages in the range
10^{5-6} years. The average color of the objects in these clusters agree with
the prediction of Willman et al., 2008. SDSS photometry of the members of very
young asteroid pairs with ages <10^5 years was used to determine their
taxonomy. The average color of the S-complex pairs is PC_1=0.49+/-0.03, over
5-sigma redder than predicted by Willman et al., 2008. Therefore, the most
likely pair formation mechanism is gentle separation due to YORP spin-up
leaving much of the aged and reddened surface undisturbed. In this case our
color measurement allows us to set an upper limit of ~64% on the disturbed
surface portion. Using pre-existing color data and our new results for the
youngest S-complex asteroid clusters we have extended our space weather model
to explicitly include the effects of regolith gardening and fit separate
weathering and gardening characteristic timescales of tau_w=960+/-160My and
tau_g=2000+/-290My respectively. The first principal component color for fresh
S-complex material is 0.37+/-0.01 while the maximum amount of local reddening
is 0.33+/-0.06. Our first-ever determination of the gardening time is in stark
contrast to our calculated gardening time of tau_g~270My based on main belt
impact rates and reasonable assumptions about crater and ejecta blanket sizes.
A possible resolution for the discrepancy is through a `honeycomb' mechanism in
which the surface regolith structure absorbs small impactors without producing
significant ejecta. This mechanism could also account for the paucity of small
craters on (433) Eros.

and indicates a highly ordered jet magnetic field. The results also require a
non-axisymmetric structure of the emission zone, implying a curved trajectory
for the emitting material within the jet, with the dissipation region located
at a considerable distance from the black hole, at about 10^5 gravitational

methodology for Bayesian Cointegrated Vector Auto Regressions (CVAR). We
replace the popular approach to sampling Bayesian CVAR models, involving griddy
Gibbs, with an automated efficient alternative, based on the Adaptive
Metropolis algorithm of Roberts and Rosenthal, (2009). Developing the adaptive
MCMC framework for Bayesian CVAR models allows for efficient estimation of
posterior parameters in significantly higher dimensional CVAR series than
previously possible with existing griddy Gibbs samplers. For a n-dimensional
CVAR series, the matrix-variate posterior is in dimension $3n^2 + n$, with
significant correlation present between the blocks of matrix random variables.
We also treat the rank of the CVAR model as a random variable and perform joint
inference on the rank and model parameters. This is achieved with a Bayesian
posterior distribution defined over both the rank and the CVAR model
parameters, and inference is made via Bayes Factor analysis of rank.
Practically the adaptive sampler also aids in the development of automated
Bayesian cointegration models for algorithmic trading systems considering
instruments made up of several assets, such as currency baskets. Previously the
literature on financial applications of CVAR trading models typically only
considers pairs trading (n=2) due to the computational cost of the griddy
Gibbs. We are able to extend under our adaptive framework to $n >> 2$ and
demonstrate an example with n = 10, resulting in a posterior distribution with
parameters up to dimension 310. By also considering the rank as a random
quantity we can ensure our resulting trading models are able to adjust to
potentially time varying market conditions in a coherent statistical framework.

the window \sim 10^3-10^6 s to put constraints on the temporal evolution of the
flare properties and to identify possible differences in the mechanism
producing the early and late time flaring emission, if any. This requires the
complete understanding of the observational biases affecting the detection of
X-ray flares superimposed on a fading continuum at t > 1000 s. We consider all
the Swift GRBs that exhibit late time flares. Our sample consists of 36 flares,
14 with redshift measurements. We inherit the strategy of data analysis from
Chincarini et al. (2010) in order to make a direct comparison with the early
time flare properties. The morphology of the flare light curve is the same for
both early time and late time flares, while they differ energetically. The
width of late time flares increases with time similarly to the early time
flares. Simulations confirmed that the increase of the width with time is not
due to the decaying statistics, at least up to 10^4 s. The energy output of
late time flares is one order of magnitude lower than the early time flare one,
being \sim 1% E_{prompt}. The evolution of the peak luminosity as well as the
distribution of the peak flux-to-continuum ratio for late time flares indicate
that the flaring emission is decoupled from the underlying continuum,
differently from early time flares/steep decay. A sizable fraction of late time
flares are compatible with afterglow variability. The internal shock origin
seems the most promising explanation for flares. However, some differences that
emerge between late and early time flares suggest that there could be no unique
explanation about the nature of late time flares.

the same phase under local unitary transformations. Therefore, local unitary
transformations define an equivalence relation and the equivalence classes are
the universality classes that define the different phases for gapped quantum
systems. Since local unitary transformations can remove local entanglement, the
above equivalence/universality classes correspond to pattern of long range
entanglement, which is the essence of topological order. The local unitary
transformation also allows us to define a wave function renormalization scheme,
under which a wave function can flow to a simpler one within the same

algorithm allows us to calculate the flow of tensor-product wave functions

show that this empirical evidence in real flocks, namely, the structure of
anisotropy also emerges in an artificial flock simulation based on the {\it
BOIDS} by Reynolds [{\it Computer Graphics} {\bf 21}, pp.25-34 (1987)]. We
numerically find that appropriate combinations of the weights for just only
three essential factors of the BOIDS, namely, `Cohesion', `Alignment' and
`Separation' lead to a strong anisotropy in the flock. This result seems to be
highly counter-intuitive and also provides a justification of the hypothesis
that the anisotropy emerges as a result of self-organization of interacting
intelligent agents (birds for instance). To quantify the anisotropy, we
evaluate a useful statistics (a kind of {\it order parameters} in statistical
physics), that is to say, the so-called $\gamma$-value defined as an inner
product between the vector in the direction of the lowest angular density of
flocks and the vector in the direction of the moving of the flock. Our results
concerning the emergence of the anisotropy through the $\gamma$-value might
enable us to judge whether an arbitrary flock simulation seems to be {\it

manifests itself in the lineshape of the spectra of nuclear forward scattering
(NFS) Fourier-transformed from time domain to frequency domain. This lineshape
is generally described by the convolution of two intensity factors. One of them
is Lorentzian related to free decay. We derived the expressions for the second
factor related to Frenkel exciton polariton effects at propagation of
synchrotron radiation in Moessbauer media. Parameters of this Frenkelian shape
depend on the spatial configuration of Moessbauer media. In a layer of uniform
thickness, this factor is found to be a simple hypergeometric function. Next,
we consider the particles spread over a 2D surface or diluted in non-Moessbauer
media to exclude an overlap of ray shadows by different particles. Deconvolving
the purely polaritonic component of linewidths is suggested as a simple
procedure sharpening the experimental NFS spectra in frequency domain. The
lineshapes in these sharpened spectra are theoretically expressed via the
parameters of the particle size distributions (PSD). Then, these parameters are
determined through least-squares fitting of the line shapes.

winds of first generation stars driven purely by CNO elements. We apply our
NLTE multicomponent models and hydrodynamical simulations. The multicomponent
effects (frictional heating and decoupling) are important particularly for low
metallicity winds, but they influence mass loss rate only if they cause
decoupling for velocities lower than the escape velocity. The multicomponent
effects also modify the feedback from first stars. As a result of the
decoupling of radiatively accelerated metals from hydrogen and helium, the
first low-energy cosmic ray particles are generated. We study the interaction
of these particles with the interstellar medium concluding that these particles
easily penetrate the interstellar medium of a given minihalo. We discuss the

the methods of Algebraic Renormalization. We work in the on-shell component

  (henceforth, referred to as model I).
  A parameter $p$ is now defined to modify the dynamics such that a spin can
sense domain sizes up to $R = pL/2$ in a one dimensional system of size $L$.
For the cutoff factor $p$ \to 0$, the dynamics is Ising like and the domains
grow with time $t$ diffusively as $ t^{1/z}$ with $z=2$, while for $p=1$, the
original model I showed ballistic dynamics with $z \simeq 1$. For intermediate
values of $p$, the domain growth, magnetisation and persistence show model I
like behaviour up to a macroscopic crossover time $ t_1 \sim pL/2$. Beyond
$t_1$, characteristic power law variations of the dynamic quantities are no
longer observed. The total time to reach equilibrium is found to be $t = apL +
b(1-p)^3L^2$, from which we conclude that the later time behaviour is
diffusive. We also consider the case when a random but quenched value of $p$ is
used for each spin for which ballistic behaviour is once again obtained.

major open issue in stellar evolution. Large photometric and spectroscopic
databases allow a re-examination of this issue. We derive median and extreme
(90% of the distribution) colours and magnitudes of stars along the HB for
about a hundred GCs. We transform these into median and extreme masses of stars
on the HB taking into account evolutionary effects, and compare these masses
with those expected at the tip of the Red Giant Branch to derive the total mass
lost by the stars. A simple linear dependence on metallicity of this total mass
lost explains well the median colours of HB stars. Adopting this mass loss law
as universal, we find that age is the main second parameter. However, at least
a third parameter is clearly required. The most likely candidate is the He
abundance, which might be different in GCs stars belonging to the different
stellar generations whose presence was previously derived from the Na-O and
Mg-Al anticorrelations. Variations in the median He abundance allow explaining
the extremely blue HB of some GCs; such variations are correlated with the
R-parameter. Suitable He abundances allow deriving ages from the HB which are
consistent with those obtained from the Main Sequence. Small corrections to
these latter ages are then proposed, producing a tight age-metallicity relation
for disk and bulge GCs. Star-to-star variations in the He content explain the
extension of the HB. There is a strong correlation between this extension and
the interquartile of the Na-O anticorrelation. The main driver for the
variations in the He-content within GCs seems the total cluster mass. 47 Tuc
and M3 exhibit exceptional behaviours; however, they can be accommodated in a
scenario for the formation of GCs that relates their origin to cooling flows
generated after very large episodes of star formation.

identified and separated from the drift itself. When it is of interest to model

for the distinction of between and within experiment variability. A framework
to model dynamics within a population using SDEs is proposed, representing
simultaneously several sources of variation: variability between experiments
using a mixed-effects approach and stochasticity in the individual dynamics
using SDEs. These ""stochastic differential mixed-effects models"" have
applications in e.g. pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and biomedical

guidelines for an efficient implementation are given. Finally the method is
evaluated using simulations from standard models like the two-dimensional

galaxies should be generally triaxial. Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is
believed to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar
formation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the
bar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body
simulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical
discs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities
and, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar
formation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc
velocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially
axisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo
triaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong
stellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it
to lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial
conditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain
triaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is
limited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the
circularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed
to the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond
excessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also
lose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form
stronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on
their haloes is also more rapid. We also analyse halo vertical shapes and
observe that their vertical flattenings remain considerable, meaning that the
haloes become approximately oblate by the end of the simulations. [abridged]

obtain low resolution spectroscopy of the coolest candidates to characterise
their atmospheric physics. We have so far analysed and followed up all

the part of the celestial sphere with the lowest column densities of the Local

density of the intervening LIC material. We show that a plane-parallel or
slightly curved interface layer of contact between the LIC H atoms (n_H = 0.2

together with indirect contribution coming from multiply-scattered ENAs from
the LB, may be able to explain both the shape of the ribbon and the observed
intensities provided that the edge is < (500-2000) AU away, the LIC proton
density is (correspondingly) < (0.04-0.01) cm^-3, and the LB contains ~1% of

IBEX, for the first time, has imaged in ENAs a celestial object from beyond the

understand the nature and origin of the ionization mechanisms operating in the
extranuclear regions of LIRGs as a function of the interaction phase and L_IR
by using IFS data obtained with VIMOS. Our analysis is based on over 25300
spectra of 32 LIRGs covering all types of morphologies and the entire
10^11-10^12 L_sun range. We found strong evidence for shock ionization, with a
clear trend with the dynamical status of the system. Specifically, we
quantified the variation with interaction phase of several line ratios
indicative of the excitation degree. While the [NII]/Ha ratio does not show any
significant change, the [SII]/Ha and [OI]/Ha ratios are higher for more
advanced interaction stages. We constrained the main mechanisms causing the
ionization in the extra-nuclear regions using diagnostic diagrams. Isolated
systems are mainly consistent with ionization caused by young stars. Large
fractions of the extra-nuclear regions in interacting pairs and more advanced
mergers are consistent with ionization caused by shocks. This is supported by
the relation between the excitation degree and the velocity dispersion of the
ionized gas, which we interpret as evidence for shock ionization in interacting
galaxies and advanced mergers but not in isolated galaxies. This relation does
not show any dependence with L_IR. All this indicates that tidal forces play a
key role in the origin of the ionizing shocks in the extra-nuclear regions. We
also showed what appears to be a common [OI]/Ha-sigma relation for the
extranuclear ionized gas in interacting (U)LIRGs. This needs to be investigated
further with a larger sample of ULIRGs.
