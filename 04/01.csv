penetration depth measurements with a tunnel diode oscillator in a pulsed
magnetic field. We examined four samples with 1100 field sweeps in a range of
angles with the magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the conducting
planes. In the parallel direction, $H_{c2}$ appears to include a tricritical
point at 1.6 K and 10 T with a phase line that increases to 11 T as the
temperature is decreased to} 500 mK. The second phase line forms a clearly
defined high field low temperature region satisfying several of the conditions
of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. We show remarkably good
fits of $H_{c2}$ to WHH in the reentrant $\alpha>1$, $\lambda_{so}=0$ regime.
We also note a sharp angle dependence of the phase diagram about the field
parallel orientation that characterizes Pauli paramagnetic limiting and further
supports the possibility of FFLO behavior. Unrelated to the FFLO study, at
fields and temperatures below $H_{c2}$ and $T_c$, we find rich structure in the
penetration depth data that we attribute to impurities at the surface altering
the superconducting properties while maintaining the same crystallographic axes
as $H_{c2}$.

rise to sequences $D_i$ of invariant differential operators, known as the
curved version of the BGG resolution. These sequences are constructed from the
normal covariant derivative $\na^\om$ on the corresponding tractor bundle $V,$
where $\om$ is the normal Cartan connection. The first operator $D_0$ in the
sequence is overdetermined and it is well known that $\na^\om$ yields the
prolongation of this operator in the homogeneous case $M = G/P$. Our first main
result is the curved version of such a prolongation. This requires a new
normalization $\tilde{\na}$ of the tractor covariant derivative on $V$.
Moreover, we obtain an analogue for higher operators $D_i$. In that case one
needs to modify the exterior covariant derivative $d^{\na^\om}$ by differential
terms. Finally we demonstrate these results on simple examples in projective

  Results: Comparison between model results and observation shows that by
combining grain surface processing with gas phase chemistry complex molecules

particular, we construct certain background independent analogue of quantum
Virasoro generators and show that in spin-zero representation they satisfy the

primary Background CMB anisotropies. The Standard Model of the Universe
(including inflation) provides the context to analyze the CMB and other data.
The Planck performance for r, the tensor to scalar ratio related to primordial
B mode polarization, will depend on the quality of the data analysis. The
Ginsburg Landau approach to inflation allows to take high benefit of the CMB
data. The fourth degree double well inflaton potential gives an excellent fit
to the current CMB+LSS data. We evaluate the Planck precision to the recovery
of cosmological parameters within a reasonable toy model for residuals of
systematic effects of instrumental and astrophysical origin based on publicly
available information.We use and test two relevant models: the LambdaCDMr
model, i.e. the standard LambdaCDM model augmented by r, and the LambdaCDMrT
model, where the scalar spectral index, n_s, and r are related through the
theoretical `banana-shaped' curve r = r(n_s) coming from the double-well
inflaton potential. In the latter case, r = r(n_s) is imposed as a hard
constraint in the MCMC data analysis. We take into account the white noise
sensitivity of Planck in the 70, 100 and 143 GHz channels as well as the
residuals from systematics errors and foregrounds. Foreground residuals turn to
affect only the cosmological parameters sensitive to the B modes. The best
value for r in the presence of residuals turns to be about r simeq 0.04 for
both the LambdaCDMr and the LambdaCDMrT models. We compute the B mode detection
probability by the most sensitive HFI-143 channel. At the level of foreground
residual equal to 30% of our toy model only a 68% CL detection of r is very
likely. For a 95% CL detection the level of foreground residual should be
reduced to 10% or lower of the adopted toy model (ABRIDGED).

the radiative loss terms, non-ideal equations of state, and empirical corona
heating. We find that the convection plays a crucial role in shaping the
morphology and evolution of the emerging structure. The emergence of magnetic
fields can disrupt the convection pattern as the field strength increases, and
form an ephemeral region-like structure, while weak magnetic flux emerges and
quickly becomes concentrated in the intergranular lanes, i.e. downflow regions.
As the flux rises, a coherent shear pattern in the low corona is observed in
the simulation. In the photosphere, both magnetic shearing and velocity
shearing occur at a very sharp polarity inversion line (PIL). In a case of
U-loop magnetic field structure, the field above the surface is highly sheared

over the range $0.1<z<1.3$, using the data from the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey
(VVDS). The galaxy projected correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ was computed for a
set of luminosity-limited subsamples and fits to its shape were obtained using
two variants of Halo Occupation Distribution models. These provide us with a
set of best-fitting parameters, from which we obtain the average mass of a halo
and average number of galaxies per halo. We find that after accounting for the
evolution in luminosity and assuming that we are largely following the same
population, the underlying dark matter halo shows a growth in mass with
decreasing redshift as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario.
Using two different HOD models, we see that the halo mass grows by 90% over the
redshift interval z=[0.5,1.0]. This is the first time the evolution in halo
mass at high redshifts has been obtained from a single data survey and it
follows the simple form seen in N-body simulations with $M(z) = M_0 e^{-\beta
z}$, and $\beta = 1.3 \pm 0.30$. This provides evidence for a rapid accretion
phase of massive halos having a present-day mass $M_0 \sim 10^{13.5} h^{-1}
M_\odot$, with a $m > 0.1 M_0$ merger event occuring between redshifts of 0.5
and 1.0. Futhermore, we find that more luminous galaxies are found to occupy
more massive halos irrespectively of the redshift. Finally, the average number
of galaxies per halo shows little increase from redshift z$\sim$ 1.0 to z$\sim$
0.5, with a sharp increase by a factor $\sim$3 from z$\sim$ 0.5 to z$\sim$ 0.1,
likely due to the dynamical friction of subhalos within their host halos.

during the final, overlap phase. Our method uses an efficient three-dimensional
smoothing technique which takes into account the finite mean free path due to
absorption systems, lambda, by only smoothing over scales R_s<lambda. The large
dynamic range of our calculations is necessary to resolve the neutral patches
left at the end of reionization within a representative volume; we find that
simulation volumes exceeding several hundred Mpc on a side are necessary in
order to properly model reionization when the neutral fraction is ~0.01-0.3.
Our results indicate a strong dependence of percolation morphology on a large
and uncertain region of model parameter space. The single most important
parameter is the mean free path to absorption systems, which serve as opaque
barriers to ionizing radiation. If these absorption systems were as abundant as
some realistic estimates indicate, the spatial structure of the overlap phase
is considerably more complex than previously predicted. In view of the lack of
constraints on the mean free path at the highest redshifts, current theories
that do not include absorption by Lyman-limit systems, and in particular
three-dimensional simulations, may underestimate the abundance of neutral
clouds at the end of reionization. This affects predictions for the 21 cm
signal associated with reionization, interpretation of absorption features in
quasar spectra at z ~5-6, the connection between reionization and the local
universe, and constraints on the patchiness and duration of reionization from
temperature fluctuations measured in the cosmic microwave background arising

X-ray obscuring clouds, we can reproduce the apparent flat spectral states with
\Gamma~1.7, typical for Seyfert 1 AGNs. The same model also fits the hard

as variations in intrinsic soft continuum flux relative to a Compton reflection

or variations of partially covering absorber in the line of sight towards the

results of the model based on realistic cosmological simulations of high-z
galaxy formation for a grid of numerical models with varied dust-to-gas ratios
and interstellar far UV (FUV) fluxes. Our results show that both the
atomic-to-molecular transition on small, ~10 pc scales and the
Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation on ~kpc scales are sensititive to the
dust-to-gas ratio and the FUV flux. The atomic-to-molecular transition as a
function of gas density or column density has a large scatter but is rather
sharp and shifts to higher densities with decreasing dust-to-gas ratio and/or
increasing FUV flux. Consequently, star formation is concentrated to higher gas
surface density regions, resulting in steeper slope and lower amplitude of the
KS relation at a given gas surface density, in less dusty and/or higher FUV
flux environments. These trends should have a particularly strong effect on the
evolution of low-mass, low surface brightness galaxies which typically have low
dust content and anemic star formation, but are also likely to be important for
evolution of the Milky Way-sized systems. We parameterize the dependencies
observed in our simulations in convenient fitting formulae, which can be used
to model the dependence of the KS relation on the dust-to-gas ratio and FUV
flux in semi-analytic models and in cosmological simulations that do not

study of the main subgrid processes that control how gas is converted into

attempts to form disc galaxies have been unsuccessful because of the universal
adoption of strong feedback combined with high star formation efficiencies.
Unless extreme amounts of energy are injected into the interstellar medium
during supernovae events, these star formation parameters result in bulge
dominated S0/Sa galaxies as star formation is too efficient at z~3. We show
that a low efficiency of star-formation more closely models the subparsec
physical processes, especially at high redshift. We highlight the successful
formation of extended disc galaxies with scale lengths r_d=4-5 kpc, flat
rotation curves and bulge to disc ratios of B/D~1/4. Not only do we resolve the
formation of a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy, we also observe the secular
evolution of the disc as it forms a pseudo-bulge. The disc properties agree
well with observations and are compatible with the photometric and baryonic
Tully-Fisher relations, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and the observed angular
momentum content of spiral galaxies. We conclude that underlying small-scale
star formation physics plays a larger role than previously considered in

reconstruction and 3D tumor localization based on a single x-ray projection
image for lung cancer radiotherapy. Methods: Given a set of volumetric images
of a patient at N breathing phases as the training data, we perform deformable
image registration between a reference phase and the other N-1 phases,
resulting in N-1 deformation vector fields (DVFs). These DVFs can be
represented efficiently by a few eigenvectors and coefficients obtained from
principal component analysis (PCA). By varying the PCA coefficients, we can
generate new DVFs, which, when applied on the reference image, lead to new
volumetric images. We then can reconstruct a volumetric image from a single
projection image by optimizing the PCA coefficients such that its computed
projection matches the measured one. The 3D location of the tumor can be
derived by applying the inverted DVF on its position in the reference image.
Our algorithm was implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs) to achieve
real-time efficiency. We generated the training data using a realistic and
dynamic mathematical phantom with 10 breathing phases. The testing data were
360 cone beam projections corresponding to one gantry rotation, simulated using
the same phantom with a 50% increase in breathing amplitude. Results: The
average relative image intensity error of the reconstructed volumetric images
is 6.9% +/- 2.4%. The average 3D tumor localization error is 0.8 mm +/- 0.5 mm.
On an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card, the average computation time for
reconstructing a volumetric image from each projection is 0.24 seconds (range:
0.17 and 0.35 seconds). Conclusions: We have shown the feasibility of
reconstructing volumetric images and localizing tumor positions in 3D in near

observations of blazars and is based on the assumption that the intrinsic
spectral energy distribution (SED) of TeV blazars lies below the extrapolation
of the {\em Fermi}-LAT SED from GeV to TeV energies. By extrapolating the {\em
Fermi}-LAT spectrum, which for TeV blazars is practically unattenuated by
photon-photon pair production with EBL photons, a firm upper limit on the
intrinsic SED at TeV energies is provided. The ratio of the extrapolated
spectrum to the observed TeV spectrum provides upper limits to the optical
depth for the propagation of the TeV photons due to pair production on the EBL,
which in turn sets firm upper limits to EBL models. We demonstrate our method
using simultaneous observations from {\em Fermi}-LAT and ground-based TeV
telescopes of the blazars \object{PKS 2155-304} and \object{1ES 1218+304}, and
show that high EBL density models are disfavored. We also discuss how our
method can be optimized and how {\em Fermi} and X-ray monitoring observations
of TeV blazars can guide future TeV campaigns, leading to potentially much
stronger constraints on EBL models.

Multipartite entanglement has been achieved by use of various forms of quantum
bits (qubits), such as trapped ions, photons, and atoms passing through
microwave cavities. Quantum systems based on superconducting circuits have been
used to control pair-wise interactions of qubits, either directly, through a
quantum bus, or via controllable coupling. Here, we describe the first
demonstration of coherent interactions of three directly coupled

introduce a simple Bloch-sphere-like representation to help one visualize the
unitary evolution of this tripartite system as it shares a single microwave
photon. With careful control and timing of the initial conditions, this leads
to a protocol for creating a rich variety of entangled states. Experimentally,
we provide evidence for the deterministic evolution from a simple product
state, through a tripartite W-state, into a bipartite Bell-state. These
experiments are another step towards deterministically generating multipartite

bipolar planetary nebulae (BPNe), using imaging and spectroscopy acquired using
the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST), and the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional in
Mexico. The results show that the sources are more extended towards longer MIR
wavelengths, as well as having higher levels of surface brightness in the 5.8
and 8.0 microns bands. It is also noted that the 5.8/4.5 and 8.0/4.5 microns
flux ratios increase with increasing distance from the nuclei of the sources.
All of these latter trends may be attributable to emission by polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and/or warm dust continua within circum-nebular
photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). A corresponding decrease in the flux ratios
8.0/5.8 microns may, by contrast, arise due to changes in the properties of the
PAH emitting grains. We note evidence for possible 8.0 microns ring-like
structures in the envelope of NGC 2346, located in a region beyond the minor
axis limits of the ionized envelope. An analysis of the inner two rings shows
that whilst they have higher surface brightnesses at longer MIR wavelengths,
they are relatively stronger (compared to underlying emission) at 3.6 and 4.5
microns. There is also evidence for point reflection symmetry along the major
axis of the outflow.

in step-flow mode was characterized using low temperature STM. It was found
that one-dimensional (1D) TiOx-based nanostructures were formed on the thin
film surface and their density increased with increasing thin film thickness.
Most of the 1D nanostructures disappeared after a post-deposition annealing,
indicating that this structure is metastable due to the nonequilibrium growth
mode. The resulting surface after annealing exhibited similar features to that
of a thinner film, having a domain structure with (2x1) and (1x2)
reconstructions, but with fewer oxygen-vacancy-type defects. These results
imply that the step-flow growth is likely to produce TiOx-rich surface and Ti
deficiencies in the film. By the post-deposition annealing, the rich TiOx would
diffuse from the surface into the film to compensate defects associated with Ti
vacancies and oxygen vacancies, resulting in the stable surface structure with
fewer oxygen vacancies. Thus, STM measurements can provide us with a
microscopic picture of surface stoichiometry of thin films originating in the
dynamics of the growth process, and can present a new approach for designing
functional oxide films.

standardized, homogeneous BVIc CCD survey of the cluster in order to establish
photometric cluster membership and assign B-V colours to each photometric
variable. We describe a methodology for establishing the gyrochronology age for
an ensemble of solar-type stars. Empirical relations between rotation period,
photometric colour and stellar age (gyrochronology) are used to determine the
age of M 34. Based on its position in a colour-period diagram, each M 34 member
is designated as being either a solid-body rotator (interface or I-star), a
differentially rotating star (convective or C-star) or an object which is in
some transitory state in between the two (gap or g-star). Fitting the period
and photometric colour of each I-sequence star in the cluster, we derive the
cluster's mean gyrochronology age.
  47/55 of the photometric variables lie along the loci of the cluster main
sequence in V/B-V and V/V-I space. We are further able to confirm kinematic
membership of the cluster for half of the periodic variables [21/55], employing
results from an on-going radial velocity survey of the cluster. For each
cluster member identified as an I-sequence object in the colour-period diagram,
we derive its individual gyrochronology age, where the mean gyro age of M 34 is
found to be 193 +/- 9 Myr, formally consistent (within the errors) with that
derived using several distance-dependent, photometric isochrone methods (250
+/- 67 Myr).

anonymization and structural anonymization. But with the growing interest in
analyzing social networks as a weighted network, edge weight anonymization is
also gaining importance. We present An\'onimos, a Linear Programming based
technique for anonymization of edge weights that preserves linear properties of
graphs. Such properties form the foundation of many important graph-theoretic
algorithms such as shortest paths problem, k-nearest neighbors, minimum cost
spanning tree, and maximizing information spread. As a proof of concept, we
apply An\'onimos to the shortest paths problem and its extensions, prove the
correctness, analyze complexity, and experimentally evaluate it using real
social network data sets. Our experiments demonstrate that An\'onimos
anonymizes the weights, improves k-anonymity of the weights, and also scrambles
the relative ordering of the edges sorted by weights, thereby providing robust
and effective anonymization of the sensitive edge-weights. Additionally, we
demonstrate the composability of different models generated using An\'onimos, a
property that allows a single anonymized graph to preserve multiple linear

physical properties of YSOs.The ice absorption features of H2O, CO2, 13CO2, CO,
CH3OH, and possibly XCN are detected in the spectra. In addition, hydrogen
recombination lines and PAH emission bands are detected toward the majority of
the targets. The derived typical CO2/H2O ice ratio of our samples (~0.36 +-
0.09) is greater than that of Galactic massive YSOs (~0.17 +- 0.03), while the
CO/H2O ice ratio is comparable. It is shown that the CO2 ice abundance does not
correlate with the observed characteristics of YSOs; the strength of hydrogen
recombination line and the total luminosity. Likewise, clear no correlation is
seen between the CO ice abundance and YSO characteristics, but it is suggested
that the CO ice abundance of luminous samples is significantly lower than in
other samples.The systematic difference in the CO2 ice abundance around the
LMC's massive YSOs, which was suggested by previous studies, is confirmed with
the new near-infrared data. We suggest that the strong ultraviolet radiation
field and/or the high dust temperature in the LMC are responsible for the
observed high abundance of the CO2 ice. It is suggested that the internal
stellar radiation does not play an important role in the evolution of the CO2
ice around a massive YSO, while more volatile molecules like CO are susceptible
to the effect of the stellar radiation.

star populations. We study the spatial localization of the WR-rich clusters via
the detection of the blue WR bump (broad He II 4686) and the red WR bump (broad
C IV 5808). We perform a detailed fitting of the nebular and broad emission
lines within these broad features and derive the numbers of WN, WC and O stars
using (i) the standard assumption of constant WR luminosities and (ii)
considering metallicity-dependent WR luminosities. We then compare our results
with the predictions given by evolutionary synthesis models and with previous
empirical results. Aperture effects and the exact positioning of the slit onto
the WR-rich bursts play a fundamental role in their detection. As expected, the
total number of WR stars increases with increasing metallicity, but objects
with 12+log(O/H)<8.2 show a rather constant WR/(WR+O) ratio. The computed
WCE/WNL ratios are different than those empirically found in nearby
star-forming galaxies, indicating that the observed galaxies are experiencing a
strong and very short burst. Considering metallicity-dependent WR luminosities,
our data agree with a Salpeter-like IMF in all regimes. We consider that the
contribution of the WCE stars is not negligible at low metallicities. Although
available models reproduce fairly well the WR properties at high metallicities,
new evolutionary synthesis models for young starbursts including all involved
parameters (age, metallicity, star-formation history, IMF and WR stars
properties such as metallicity-dependent WR luminosities, stellar rotation and
the WR binnary channel) are absolutely needed to perform an appropriate

equivalent to a simple relation naturally expressing the fact that one program

intensity and the turbulent heat flux that are caused by the combined action of
the small-scale fluctuations are computed. The correlation length of the
turbulence significantly depends on the strength and orientation of the
magnetic field and the anisotropic behavior of the turbulence intensity induced
by Coriolis and Lorentz force is considerably more pronounced for faster
rotation. The development of isotropic behavior on the small scales -- as it is
observed in pure rotating convection -- vanishes even for a weak magnetic field
which results in a turbulent flow that is dominated by the vertical component.
In the presence of a horizontal magnetic field the vertical turbulent heat flux
slightly increases with increasing field strength, so that cooling of the
rotating system is facilitated. Horizontal transport of heat is always directed
westwards and towards the poles. The latter might be a source of a large-scale
meridional flow whereas the first would be important in global simulations in

taken as the starting point for an evaluation of how self-consistent incoherent
synchrotron models fare in a comparison with observations. Inclusion of
synchrotron self-absorption proves important as does the restriction on the
observed size of the emission region imposed by the relativistic beaming
thought to define the pulse profile. It is shown that the observations can be
used to derive two independent constraints on the distance from the neutron
star to the emission region; in addition to a direct lower limit, an indirect
measure is obtained from an upper limit to the magnetic field strength. Both of
these limits indicate that the emission region is located at a distance
considerably larger than the light cylinder radius. The implications of this
result are discussed and it is emphasized that, in order for standard
incoherent synchrotron models to fit inside the light cylinder, rather special

kinetic energy is roughly twice larger, and the kinetic energy supply is

disk and its corona. Such a black hole magnetosphere may be considered as a
model for the central engine of active galactic nuclei, some compact X-ray
sources and gamma-ray bursts. The energy sources of the emission from the
magnetosphere are the gravitational and electromagnetic energies of magnetized
accreting matters and the rotational energy of a rotating black hole. When the
MHD shock generates in MHD accretion flows onto the black hole, the plasma's
kinetic energy and hole's rotational energy can convert to radiative energy. In
this letter, we demonstrate the huge energy output at the shock front by
showing negative energy postshock accreting MHD flows for a rapidly rotating
black hole. This means that the extracted energy from the black hole can
convert to the radiative energy at the MHD shock front. When axisymmetric shock

measurements are performed on systems distributed on a general graph, transport
and processing of quantum information is not possible beyond a certain
influence region, except for exponentially suppressed corrections. We also
demonstrate that even under arbitrary non-Gaussian local measurements, slabs of
Gaussian cluster states of a finite width cannot carry logical quantum
information, even if sophisticated encodings of qubits in continuous-variable
(CV) systems are allowed for. This is proven by suitably contracting tensor
networks representing infinite-dimensional quantum systems. The result can be
seen as sharpening the requirements for quantum error correction and fault
tolerance for Gaussian cluster states, and points towards the necessity of
non-Gaussian resource states for measurement-based quantum computing. The
results can equally be viewed as referring to Gaussian quantum repeater
networks.

Faug\`ere in 2002 without complete proofs for its correctness. The current
authors have simplified the original F5 algorithm into an F5 algorithm in
Buchberger's style (F5B algorithm), which is equivalent to original F5
algorithm and may deduce some F5-like versions. In this paper, the F5B
algorithm is briefly revisited and a new complete proof for the correctness of
F5B algorithm is proposed. This new proof is not limited to homogeneous systems
and does not depend on the strategy of selecting critical pairs (i.e. the
strategy deciding which critical pair is computed first) such that any strategy
could be utilized in F5B (F5) algorithm. From this new proof, we find that the
special reduction procedure (F5-reduction) is the key of F5 algorithm, so
maintaining this special reduction, various variation algorithms become
available. A natural variation of F5 algorithm, which transforms original F5
algorithm to a non-incremental algorithm, is presented and proved in this paper
as well. This natural variation has been implemented over the Boolean ring. The
two revised criteria in this natural variation are also able to reject almost
all unnecessary computations and few polynomials reduce to 0 in most examples.

stellar winds of fast rotating massive stars on the chemical enrichment of the
early Galaxy. We use an inhomogeneous chemical evolution model for the Galactic
halo to predict both the mean trend and scatter of C/O and N/O. In one set of
models, we assume that massive stars enrich the interstellar medium during both
the stellar wind and supernovae phases. In the second set, we consider that in
the earliest phases (Z <10^-8), stars with masses above 40 Msun only enrich the
interstellar medium via stellar winds, collapsing directly into black holes. We
predict a larger scatter in the C/O and N/O ratios at low metallicities when
allowing the more massive fast-rotating stars to contribute to the chemical
enrichment only via stellar winds. The latter assumption, combined with the
stochasticity in the star formation process in the primordial Galactic halo can
explain the wide spread observed in the N/O and C/O ratios in normal
very-metal-poor stars. For chemical elements with stellar yields that depend
strongly on initial mass (and rotation) such as C, N, and neutron capture
elements, within the range of massive stars, a large scatter is expected once
the stochastic enrichment of the early interstellar medium is taken into
account. We also find that stellar winds of fast rotators mixed with
interstellar medium gas are not enough to explain the large CNO enhancements
found in most of the carbon-enhanced very-metal-poor stars. In particular, this
is the case of the most metal-poor star known to date, HE 1327-2326, for which
our models predict lower N enhancements than observed when assuming a mixture
of stellar winds and interstellar medium. We suggest that these carbon-enhanced
very metal-poor stars were formed from almost pure stellar wind material,
without dilution with the pristine interstellar medium.

shearing boxes exhibit powerful coherent flows, whereby the fluid vertically
splits into countermoving planar jets or `channels'. Channel flows correspond
to certain axisymmetric linear MRI modes, and their preponderance follows from
the remarkable fact that they are approximate nonlinear solutions of the MHD
equations in the limit of weak magnetic fields. We show in this paper,
analytically and with one-dimensional numerical simulations, that this property
is also shared by certain axisymmetric MRI modes in vertically-stratified
shearing boxes. These channel flows rapidly capture significant amounts of
magnetic and kinetic energy, and thus are vulnerable to secondary shear
instabilities. We examine these parasites in the vertically stratified context,
and estimate the maximum amplitudes that channels attain before they are
destroyed. These estimates suggest that a dominant channel flow will usually
drive the disk's magnetic field to thermal strengths. The prominence of these
flows and their destruction place enormous demands on simulations, but channels
in their initial stages also offer a useful check on numerical codes. These
benchmarks are especially valuable given the increasing interest in the
saturation of the stratified MRI. Lastly we speculate on the potential
connection between 'run-away' channel flows and outburst behaviour in
protostellar and dwarf nova disks.

fluctuations of the corresponding order parameter are subject to boundary
conditions. These constraints result in so-called critical Casimir forces
acting as effective forces on the confining surfaces. For systems belonging to
the Ising bulk universality class corresponding to a scalar order parameter the
critical Casimir force is studied for the film geometry in the crossover regime
characterized by different surface fields at the two surfaces. The scaling
function of the critical Casimir force is calculated within mean field theory.
Within our approach, the scaling functions of the critical Casimir force and of
the order parameter profile for finite surface fields can be mapped by
rescaling, except for a narrow crossover regime, onto the corresponding scaling
function of the so-called normal fixed point of strong surface fields. In the
crossover regime, the critical Casimir force as function of temperature
exhibits more than one extremum and for certain ranges of surface field
strengths it changes sign twice upon varying temperature. Monte Carlo
simulation data obtained for a three-dimensional Ising film show similar
trends. The sign of the critical Casimir force can be inferred from the
comparison of the order parameter profiles in the film and in the semi-infinite
geometry.

investigation is based on four new all-sky median colour excess extinction maps
determined from 2MASS. The four maps span a range of spatial resolution of a
factor of eight. This allows us to determine cloud properties at a common
spatial scale of 0.1pc, as well as to study the scale dependence of the cloud
properties. We find that the low column density and turbulence dominated part
of the clouds can be well fit by a log-normal distribution. However, above a
universal extinction threshold of 6.0 \pm 1.5mag A_V there is excess material
compared to the log-normal distribution in all investigated clouds. This
material represents the part of the cloud that is currently involved in star
formation, and thus dominated by gravity. Its contribution to the total mass of
the clouds ranges over two orders of magnitude from 0.1 to 10%. This implies
that our clouds sample various stages in the evolution of GMCs. Furthermore, we
find that the column density and mass distributions are extremely similar
between clouds if we analyse only the high extinction material. On the other
hand, there are significant differences between the distributions if only the
low extinction, turbulence dominated regions are considered. This shows that
the turbulent properties differ between clouds depending on their environment.
However, no significant influence on the predominant mode of star formation
(clustered or isolated) could be found. Furthermore, the fraction of the cloud
actively involved in star formation is only governed by gravity, with the
column density and mass distributions not significantly altered by local
feedback processes.

most clearly seen in the brilliant Balmer H alpha emission line. The orbital
speed of the glowing material is an important determinant of the mass of the
binary system. The circumbinary disk may be fed through the L2 point and in
turn may feed a very extended radio feature known as the ruff. Aims. To present
an analysis of spectroscopic optical data from H alpha and He I spectral lines
which reveal the circumbinary disk. To use comparisons of the rather different
signals to better understand the disk and improve estimates of the rotational
speed of the inner rim. To present a simple model which naturally explains some
apparently bizarre spectral variations with orbital phase. Methods. Published
spectra, taken almost nightly over two orbital periods of the binary system,
are analysed. H alpha and He I lines are analysed as superpositions of Gaussian
components and a simple model constructed. Results. The data are understood in
terms of a hot spot, generated by proximity of the compact object, rotating
round the inner circumbinary disk with a period of 13 days. The glowing
material fades with time, quite slowly for the H alpha source but more rapidly
for the He I spectral lines. The orbital speed of the inner rim is
approximately 250 km/s. Conclusions. The mass of the binary system must exceed
40 solar masses and the compact object must be a rather massive stellar black
hole. The corollary is that the orbital speed of the companion must exceed 130
km/s.

sensitivities over large areas. But both experiments are limited by source
confusion in the submillimeter. The high confusion noise in particular
restricts the study of the clustering properties of the sources that dominate
the cosmic infrared background. At these wavelengths, it is more appropriate to
consider the statistics of the unresolved component. In particular, high
clustering will contribute in excess of Poisson noise in the power spectra of
CIB anisotropies. These power spectra contain contributions from sources at all
redshift. We show how the stacking technique can be used to separate the
different redshift contributions to the power spectra. We use simulations of
CIB representative of realistic Spitzer, Herschel, Planck, and SCUBA-2
observations. We stack the 24um sources in longer wavelengths maps to measure
mean colors per redshift and flux bins. The information retrieved on the mean
spectral energy distribution obtained with the stacking technique is then used
to clean the maps, in particular to remove the contribution of low-redshift
undetected sources to the anisotropies. Using the stacking, we measure the mean
flux of populations 4 to 6 times fainter than the total noise at 350um at
redshifts z=1 and z=2, respectively, and as faint as 6 to 10 times fainter than
the total noise at 850um at the same redshifts. In the deep Spitzer fields, the
detected 24um sources up to z~2 contribute significantly to the submillimeter
anisotropies. We show that the method provides excellent (using COSMOS 24um
data) to good (using SWIRE 24um data) removal of the z<2 (COSMOS) and z<1

noncommutative (NC) theories using the symplectic formalism framework. To sum
up the main features of the method, during the process of embedding, the
infinitesimal gauge generators of the gauge embedded theory are easily and
directly chosen. Among other advantages, this enables a greater control over
the final Lagrangian and brings some light on the so-called ""arbitrariness
problem"". This alternative embedding formalism also presents a way to obtain a
set of dynamically dual equivalent embedded Lagrangian densities which is
obtained after a finite number of steps in the iterative symplectic process,
oppositely to the result proposed using the BFFT formalism. On the other hand,
we will see precisely that the symplectic embedding formalism can be seen as an
alternative and an efficient procedure to the standard introduction of the
Moyal product in order to produce in a natural way a NC theory. In order to
construct a pedagogical explanation of the method to the nonspecialist we
exemplify the formalism showing that the massive NC U(1) theory is embedded in
a gauge theory using this alternative systematic path based on the symplectic
framework. Further, as other applications of the method, we describe exactly
how to obtain a Lagrangian description for the NC version of some systems
reproducing well known theories. Naming some of them, we use the procedure in
the Proca model, the irrotational fluid model and the noncommutative self-dual
model in order to obtain dual equivalent actions for these theories. To

options, Everest and Himalayas, resulting in a short correlation exposure. They
have hence become interested in offsetting part of this exposure, namely buying
back correlation. Two ways have been proposed for such a strategy : either pure
correlation swaps or dispersion trades, taking position in an index option and
the opposite position in the components options. These dispersion trades have
been set up using calls, puts, straddles, variance swaps as well as third
generation volatility products. When considering a dispersion trade using
variance swaps, one immediately sees that it gives a correlation exposure.
Empirical analysis have showed that this implied correlation was not equal to
the strike of a correlation swap with the same maturity. The purpose of this
paper is to theoretically explain such a spread. In fact, we prove that the P&L
of a dispersion trade is equal to the sum of the spread between implied and
realised correlation - multiplied by an average variance of the components -
and a volatility part. Furthermore, this volatility part is of second order,
and, more precisely, is of volga order. Thus the observed correlation spread
can be totally explained by the volga of the dispersion trade. This result is
to be reviewed when considering different weighting schemes for the dispersion
trade.

easily into any molecular dynamics program and also can utilize on-the-fly ab
initio electronic structure information. We test the methodology on three model
problems introduced by Tully and on the photodissociation of NaI. The results
show that for dynamics close to the diabatic limit the decay of fidelity due to
nondiabatic effects is described accurately by the DR. In this regime, unlike
the mixed quantum-classical methods such as surface hopping or Ehrenfest
dynamics, the DR can capture more subtle quantum effects than the population
transfer between potential energy surfaces. Hence we propose using the DR to
estimate the dynamical importance of diabatic, spin-orbit, or other couplings
between potential energy surfaces. The acquired information can help reduce the
complexity of a studied system without affecting the accuracy of the quantum
simulation.

use a modal representation of the fields. Each mode can be associated with a
quantum harmonic oscillator. We have applied the formalism to derive
quantum-mechanically the spontaneous emission rate of surface plasmon by a
two-level system. The result is in very good agreement with Green's tensor
approach in the non-lossy case. Green's approach allows also to account for
losses, so that the limitations of a quantum approach of surface plasmons are
clearly defined. Finally, the issue of stimulated versus spontaneous emission
has been addressed. Because of the increasing density of states near the

stimulated emission probability is too small to obtain gain in this frequency

sphere, the natural conformal symmetries under self-maps are extended, in a
certain way, to local symmetries under general conformal maps, and this is at
the basis of the powerful techniques of CFT. Conformal maps of simply connected
domains naturally have the structure of an infinite-dimensional groupoid, which
generalizes the finite-dimensional group of self-maps. We put a topological
structure on the space of conformal maps on simply connected domains, which
makes it into a topological groupoid. Further, we (almost) extend this to a
local manifold structure based on the infinite-dimensional Frechet topological
vector space of holomorphic functions on a given domain A. From this, we
develop the notion of conformal A-differentiability at the identity. Our main
conclusion is that quadratic differentials characterizing cotangent elements on
the local manifold enjoy properties similar to those of the holomorphic
stress-energy tensor of CFT; these properties underpin the local symmetries of
CFT. Applying the general formalism to CFT correlation functions, we show that
the stress-energy tensor is exactly such a quadratic differential. This is at
the basis of constructing the stress-energy tensor in conformal loop ensembles.
It also clarifies the relation between Cardy's boundary conditions for CFT on
simply connected domains, and the expression of the stress-energy tensor in
terms of metric variations.

the realignment of the twinning structure. Furthermore, the realignment of the

NRAO VLA photometry at 22.5 GHz, and earlier photometry at 8.5 GHz, gives a
rising spectral slope of alpha = 0.35+/-0.08. The slope implies an optically
thick synchrotron source, with a radius of about 0.04 pc, and thus T_b ~ 5 x
10^10 K. The implied radio-sphere at rest frame 31.2 GHz has a radius of 800
gravitational radii, just below the size of the broad line region in this
object. Observations at higher frequencies can probe whether or not the
radio-sphere is as compact as expected from the coronal framework for the radio
emission of radio-quiet quasars.

originally of the same size as interstellar dust. Models predict that these
grains will grow in size through coagulation. Observations of the silicate
features at micron wavelengths are consistent with growth to micron sizes
whereas the slope of the SED at longer wavelengths traces growth up to mm
sizes. We here look for a correlation between these two grain growth
indicators. A large sample of T-Tauri and Herbig-Ae/Be stars was observed with
the Spitzer Space Telescope at 5-13 micron; a subsample was observed at mm
wavelengths. We complement this subsample with data from the literature to
maximise the overlap between micron and mm observations and search for
correlations. Synthetic spectra are produced to determine which processes may
produce the dust evolution. Dust disc masses in the range <1 to 7 x 10^-4 MSun
are obtained. Most sources have a mm spectral slope consistent with grain
growth. There is a tentative correlation between the 10-micron silicate feature
and the mm slope of the SED. The observed sources seem to be grouped per
star-forming region in the micron-vs-mm diagram. The modelling results show
that the 10-micron feature becomes flatter and subsequently the mm slope
becomes shallower. Grain size distributions shallower than that of the ISM
and/or bright central stars are required to explain specific features. Settling
of larger grains towards the disc midplane affects the 10-micron feature, but
hardly the mm slope. The tentative correlation between the strength of the
10-micron feature and the mm slope suggests that the inner and outer disc
evolve simultaneously. Dust with a mass dominated by mm-sized grains is
required to explain the shallowest mm slopes. Other processes besides grain
growth may also be responsible for the removal of small grains.

the chiral density wave for large N_c QCD at finite density. Our results show
that this kind of instability occurs for sufficiently high baryon number

particular, expanding the four-supergraviton amplitude at low energy gives a
series of higher derivative corrections to Einstein's theory, with coefficients
that are automorphic functions with a rich dependence on the moduli. Boundary
conditions supplied by string and supergravity perturbation theory, together
with a chain of relations between successive groups in the E_n series,

subgroups. Using this information we are able to determine the expressions for

of specific Eisenstein series. Further, we determine key features of the
coefficient of the third term in the low energy expansion of the

dynamical two-time correlation functions in dense glass-forming liquids subject

pronounced shear thinning, i.e., a significant speedup in their steady-state
slow relaxation as compared to equilibrium. An approximate relation that
recovers the exact limit for small waiting times is derived following the
integration through transients (ITT) approach for the nonequilibrium
Smoluchowski dynamics, and is exemplified within a schematic model in the
framework of the mode-coupling theory of the glass transition (MCT). Computer
simulation results for the tagged-particle density correlation functions
corresponding to wave vectors in the shear-gradient directions from both
event-driven stochastic dynamics of a two-dimensional hard-disk system and from
previously published Newtonian-dynamics simulations of a three-dimensional
soft-sphere mixture are analyzed and compared with the predictions of the
ITT-based approximation. Good qualitative and semi-quantitative agreement is
found. Furthermore, for short waiting times, the theoretical description of the
waiting time dependence shows excellent quantitative agreement to the
simulations. This confirms the accuracy of the central approximation used
earlier to derive fluctuation dissipation ratios (Phys. Rev. Lett. 102,
135701). For intermediate waiting times, the correlation functions decay faster
at long times than the stationary ones. This behavior is predicted by our
theory and observed in simulations.
