supernova 2007bi. By performing numerical calculations of hydrodynamics,
nucleosynthesis, and radiation transport, we find that SN 2007bi is consistent
with the core-collapse supernova explosion of a 43 Msun carbon and oxygen core
obtained from the evolution of a progenitor star with a main sequence mass of
100 Msun and metallicity of Z = Zsun/200, from which its hydrogen and helium
envelopes are artificially stripped. The ejecta mass and the ejecta kinetic
energy of the models are 40 Msun and 3.6*10^{52} erg. The ejected 56Ni mass is
as large as 6.1 Msun, which results from the explosive nucleosynthesis with
large explosion energy. We also confirm that SN 2007bi is consistent with a
pair-instability supernova model as has recently been claimed. We show that the
earlier light curve data can discriminate between the models for such luminous
supernovae.

of A is a module over the representation ring of the circle. The latter is a
Laurent polynomial ring. Using the support of the module as an invariant, and
techniques of Atiyah, Bott and Segal, we deduce that there are examples of
T-C*-algebras A not KK^T-equivalent to any commutative T-C*-algebra. This is in
contrast to the non-equivariant situation, in which any C*-algebra in the
boostrap category is KK-equivalent to a commutative one. Our examples arise
from dynamics, and include Cuntz-Krieger algebras with their usual circle
actions. Using similar techniques, we also prove an equivariant version of the
Lefschetz fixed-point formula. This is a special case of a result with Ralf
Meyer that applies to general compact connected groups. The Lefschetz theorem
equates the module trace of the module map of the T-equivariant K-theory of a
smooth compact manifold induced by an equivariant self-correspondence of the
manifold, with an appropriate Kasparov product; the Kasparov product is the
T-equivariant index of the Dirac operator on a suitable `coincidence manifold'
of the correspondence. Finally, we prove several results related to
localization and the Kunneth and universal coefficient theorems, and give an
essentially complete description of the T-equivariant K-theory of compact
spaces, by combining localization techniques of Atiyah and Segal and results of
Paul Baum and Alain Connes for equivariant K-theory of finite group actions.

dual observer design technique is derived for a broad set of non-linear and
time-varying systems, where so far straightforward observer techniques were not
known. The resulting observer design is illustrated for non-linear chemical
plants, the Van-der-Pol oscillator, the discrete logarithmic map series

to shape globally the state- and time-dependent convergence behaviour ideally
suited to the non-linear or time-varying system. The technique can also be used

G and an integer k, to find a set of at most k vertices that hits all the
cycles in the graph G. Feedback Vertex Set has attracted a large amount of
research in the parameterized setting, and subsequent kernelization and
fixed-parameter algorithms have been a rich source of ideas in the field.
  In this paper we consider a more general and difficult version of the
problem, named Subset Feedback Vertex Set (SUBSET-FVS in short) where an
instance comes additionally with a set S ? V of vertices, and we ask for a set
of at most k vertices that hits all simple cycles passing through S. Because of
its applications in circuit testing and genetic linkage analysis SUBSET-FVS was
studied from the approximation algorithms perspective by Even et al.
[SICOMP'00, SIDMA'00].
  The question whether the SUBSET-FVS problem is fixed-parameter tractable was
posed independently by Kawarabayashi and Saurabh in 2009. We answer this
question affirmatively. We begin by showing that this problem is
fixed-parameter tractable when parametrized by |S|. Next we present an
algorithm which reduces the given instance to 2^k n^O(1) instances with the
size of S bounded by O(k^3), using kernelization techniques such as the
2-Expansion Lemma, Menger's theorem and Gallai's theorem. These two facts allow
us to give a 2^O(k log k) n^O(1) time algorithm solving the Subset Feedback
Vertex Set problem, proving that it is indeed fixed-parameter tractable.

may be appreciably greater. We present six evidences for this: (1) The $\sim

shown to be questionable; (2) The MSPs in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are
claimed to have $< 10^{11}$ G on the basis of a Rayleygh-Taylor instability
accretion argument. We show that the accretion argument is questionable and the
upper limit $10^{11}$ G may be much higher; (3) Low magnetic field neutron
stars have difficulty being produced in LMXBs; (4) MSPs may still be accreting
indicating a much higher magnetic field; (5) The data that predict $\sim
10^{8}$ G for MSPs also predict ages on the order of, and greater than, ten
billion years, which is much greater than normal pulsars. If the predicted ages
are wrong, most likely the predicted $\sim 10^{8}$ G fields of MSPs are wrong;
(6) When magnetic fields are measured directly with cyclotron lines in X-ray
binaries, fields $\gg 10^{8}$ G are indicated. Other scenarios should be
investigated. One such scenario is the following. Over 85% of MSPs are
confirmed members of a binary. It is possible that all MSPs are in large
separation binaries having magnetic fields $> 10^{8}$ G with their magnetic
dipole emission being balanced by low level accretion from their companions.

be thin, however, the corona is considered to be nearly quasispherical because
of its high temperature. Under these circumstances, the interface is subject to
the KH instability for a given set of the input parameters. Growth rates of the
KH unstable modes are calculated for a wide range of the input parameters. We
show that for a certain range of the perturbations, the unstable KH
perturbations are growing with time scales comparable to the inverse of the
angular velocity of the accretion disc (dynamical time scale). Thus, KH
instability at the interface of a disc-corona may have enough time to affect
the dynamical structure of its underlying accretion disc by possible exchange
of the mass, angular momentum or even energy. Our linear analysis shows that KH
instability may provide a mechanism for such exchanges between a disc and its

meson spectroscopy as a whole and not in parts. In this paper we explore in
more detail the differences and similarities in an important subset of those
approaches, the quasipotential approach. In the earlier paper, the
transformation properties of the quark-antiquark potentials were limited to a
scalar and an electromagnetic-like four vector, with the former accounting for
the confining aspects of the overall potential, and the latter the short range
portion. A part of that work consisted of developing a way in which the static
Adler-Piran potential was apportioned between those two different types of
potentials in addition to covariantization. Here we make a change in this
apportionment that leads to a substantial improvement in the resultant
spectroscopy by including a time-like confining vector potential over and above
the scalar confining one and the electromagnetic-like vector potential. Our fit
includes 19 more mesons than the earlier results and we modify the scalar
portion of the potential in such a way that allows this formalism to account
for the isoscalar mesons {\eta} and {\eta}' not included in the previous work.
Continuing the comparisons made in the previous paper with other approaches to
meson spectroscopy we examine in this paper the quasipotential approach of
Ebert, Faustov, and Galkin for a comparison with our formalism and spectral
results.

Distinct high-energy dI/dV anomalies have been observed and shown to be related
to intrinsic phonon-emission processes in graphite. The evolution of such dI/dV
anomalies under magnetic fields is further understood as a consequence of
inter-Landau level cyclotron-phonon resonance scattering. The observed
magneto-phonon effects not only shed light on the physical mechanisms
responsible for high-current transport in graphitic systems, but also offer new
perspectives for optimizing performance in graphitic nano-electronic devices.

corrosion during chlorine generation reaction. A detailed survey of XANES and
EXAFS showed that the stable RuO2 formed a nano cluster during chlorine

selecting the optimal reduced rank estimator of the coefficient matrix in
multivariate response regression models. The corresponding RSC estimator
minimizes the Frobenius norm of the fit plus a regularization term proportional
to the number of parameters in the reduced rank model. The rank of the RSC
estimator provides a consistent estimator of the rank of the coefficient
matrix; in general, the rank of our estimator is a consistent estimate of the
effective rank, which we define to be the number of singular values of the
target matrix that are appropriately large. The consistency results are valid
not only in the classic asymptotic regime, when $n$, the number of responses,
and $p$, the number of predictors, stay bounded, and $m$, the number of
observations, grows, but also when either, or both, $n$ and $p$ grow, possibly
much faster than $m$. We establish minimax optimal bounds on the mean squared
errors of our estimators. Our finite sample performance bounds for the RSC
estimator show that it achieves the optimal balance between the approximation
error and the penalty term. Furthermore, our procedure has very low
computational complexity, linear in the number of candidate models, making it
particularly appealing for large scale problems. We contrast our estimator with
the nuclear norm penalized least squares (NNP) estimator, which has an
inherently higher computational complexity than RSC, for multivariate
regression models. We show that NNP has estimation properties similar to those
of RSC, albeit under stronger conditions. However, it is not as parsimonious as
RSC. We offer a simple correction of the NNP estimator which leads to
consistent rank estimation.

Typically, the first peak appears at $10^4-10^5$ s and the second at
$10^5-10^6$ s. Furthermore, we expect to observe a single, bright X-ray peak at
the same time as the first optical peak. Because orphan afterglows do not have
prompt emission, it is necessary to monitor the entire sky every $10^4$ s in
the X-ray regime. We can test the model with orphan afterglows through the
X-ray all-sky survey collaboration and by using ground-based optical
telescopes.

is represented as a set of interacting particles (atoms). The approach for
determination of equivalent continuum values for the discrete system is
proposed. Averaging of equations of particles' motion and long wave
approximation are used in order to make link between the discrete system and
equivalent continuum. Basic balance equations for equivalent continuum are
derived from microscopic equations. Macroscopic values such as Piola and Cauchy
stress tensors and heat flux are represented via microscopic parameters.
Connection between the heat flux and temperature is discussed. Equation of
state in Mie-Gruneisen form connecting Cauchy stress tensor with deformation
gradient and thermal energy is obtained from microscopic considerations.

  edits",,,,"hep-th hep-lat hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Hermitian matrix model with general linear symmetry is argued to decouple
into a finite unitary matrix model that contains metastable multidimensional
lattice configurations and a fermion determinant. The simplest metastable state
is a Hermitian Weyl kinetic operator of either handedness on a 3+1 D lattice
with general nonlocal interactions. The Hermiticity produces 16 effective Weyl
fermions by species doubling, 8 left- and 8 right-handed. These are identified
with a Standard Model generation. Only local non-anomalous gauge fields within
the soup of general fluctuations can survive at long distances, and the degrees
of freedom for gauge field subgroups of $U(8)_L X U(8)_R$ are present. Standard
Model gauge symmetries associate with particular species symmetries, for
example change of QCD color associates with permutation of doubling status
amongst space directions. Vierbein gravity is probably also generated. While
fundamental Higgs fields are not possible, low fermion current masses can arise
from chiral symmetry breaking solutions of the fermion self-energy
Schwinger-Dyson equations, generating W mass and composite Higgs states,
similar to a scheme proposed by Gribov. Specific higher dimensional lattices
with larger spinors are potentially stable but produce non-Riemannian spaces
without conserved quadratic distances. However if the extra dimensions are
compactified, the Minowski space persists at low energy accompanied by SM
generations, potentially doubled further by duplicate zero modes in the compact
directions and potentially containing dark matter. The model is conjectured to
have an origin in infinite dimensional conformal invariance and the concept of
Bare Particulars.

of enumeration complexity. In this setting, the complexity measure is the delay
between two solutions and the total time. We present two new algorithms for
restricted classes of polynomials, which have a good delay and the same global
running time as the classical ones. Moreover they are simple to describe, use
little evaluation points and one of them is parallelizable. We introduce three
new complexity classes, TotalPP, IncPP and DelayPP, which are probabilistic
counterparts of the most common classes for enumeration problems, hoping that
randomization will be a tool as strong for enumeration as it is for decision.
Our interpolation algorithms proves that a lot of interesting problems are in
these classes like the enumeration of the spanning hypertrees of a 3-uniform
hypergraph.
  Finally we give a method to interpolate a degree 2 polynomials with an
acceptable (incremental) delay. We also prove that finding a specified monomial
in a degree 2 polynomial is hard unless RP = NP. It suggests that there is no
algorithm with a delay as good (polynomial) as the one we achieve for
multilinear polynomials.

tachyon condensation in open bosonic string field theory and cubic superstring
field theory. Even though these identity-based solutions seem to be trivial, it
turns out that after performing a suitable gauge transformation, we are left
with the known Erler-Schnabl-type solutions which correctly reproduce the value
of the D-brane tension. This result shows explicitly that how a seemingly
trivial solution can generate a non-trivial configuration which precisely
represents to the tachyon vacuum.

been investigated in the framework of multi-wavelength campaigns. Yet, studies
in this spectral domain are crucial to get complementary information on the
presence of dust and/or on the physical processes such as dust heating and
thermal bremsstrahlung. Here, we report a long-term multi-wavelength study of
the microquasar GRS 1915+105. On the one hand, we aimed at understanding the
origins of the mid-infrared emission, and on the other hand, at searching for
correlation with the high-energy and/or radio activities. We observed the
source at several epochs between 2004 and 2006 with the photometer IRAC and
spectrometer IRS, both mounted on the Spitzer Space Telescope. When available,
we completed our set of data with quasi-simultaneous RXTE and INTEGRAL
high-energy and/or Ryle radio observations from public archives. We then
studied the mid-infrared environment and activities of GRS 1915+105 through
spectral analysis and broad band fitting of its radio to X-ray spectral energy
distributions. We detected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules in all but
one IRS spectra of GRS 1915+105 which unambiguously proves the presence of a
dust component, likely photoionised by the high-energy emission. We also argue
that this dust is distributed in a disc-like structure heated by the companion
star, as observed in some Herbig Ae/Be and isolated cool giant stars. Moreover,
we show that some of the soft X-ray emission emanating from the inner regions
of the accretion disc is reprocessed and thermalised in the outer part. This
leads to a mid-infrared excess that is very likely correlated to the soft X-ray
emission. We exclude thermal bremsstrahlung as contributing significantly in
this spectral domain.
