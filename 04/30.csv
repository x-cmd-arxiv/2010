relative permittivity of a homogenized composite material (HCM), arising from
two component materials with relative permittivities $\eps_a$ and $\eps_b$. It
can be inverted to provide an estimate of $\eps_a$, from a knowledge of
$\eps^{Br}_{hcm}$ and $\eps_b$. Numerical studies show that the inverse
Bruggeman estimate $\eps_a$ can be physically implausible when (i)
$Re\{\eps^{Br}_{hcm}\}/Re\{\eps_b\} > 0 $ and the degree of HCM dissipation is
moderate or greater; or (ii) $Re\{\eps^{Br}_{hcm}\}/Re\{\eps_b\} < 0 $
regardless of the degree of HCM dissipation. Furthermore, even when the inverse
Bruggeman estimate is not obviously implausible, huge discrepancies can exist
between this estimate and the corresponding estimate provided by the inverse
Maxwell Garnett formalism.

clusters, triplets or characters into a single network that in some
well-defined sense simultaneously represents them all. We review these four
models and investigate how they are related. In general, the model chosen
influences the minimum number of reticulation events required. However, when
one obtains the input data from two binary trees, we show that the minimum
number of reticulations is independent of the model. The number of
reticulations necessary to represent the trees, triplets, clusters (in the
softwired sense) and characters (with unrestricted multiple crossover
recombination) are all equal. Furthermore, we show that these results also hold
when not the number of reticulations but the level of the constructed network
is minimised. We use these unification results to settle several complexity
questions that have been open in the field for some time. We also give explicit
examples to show that already for data obtained from three binary trees the
models begin to diverge.

remarkable to notice the approximate equalities: m_s/m_u= m_b/m_s= m_t/m_b=

can be obtained from an integral over the area enclosed by the trajectory of
the cycle projected onto a cross-plot of the two distances between beads. Two-

swimming motion with respect to the swimming axis, as occurs in the tumbling

compatible with all cosmological data can have large enough perturbations on
small scales to overproduce PBHs, and hence be excluded. The standard formulae
for the amplitude of perturbations do not hold for modes that exit the horizon
close to the end of inflation however. We use a modified flow analysis to
identify models of inflation where the amplitude of perturbations on small
scales is large. For these models we then carry out a numerical evolution of
the perturbations and use the PBH constraints on the power spectrum to
eliminate models which overproduce PBHs. Significant PBH formation can occur in
models in which inflation can continue indefinitely and is ended via a
secondary mechanism. We demonstrate that PBHs constrain these types of

restrict ourselves to self-gravitating bound objects, and base our results on
halo mass functions derived from N-body simulations. Since we consider the very
highest mass objects, the number of candidates is expected to be small, and
therefore each candidate can be extensively observed and characterized. If
objects are found with excessively large masses, or insufficient objects are
found near the maximum expected mass, this would be a strong indication of the
failure of LambdaCDM. The expected range of the highest masses is very
sensitive to redshift, providing an additional evolutionary probe of LambdaCDM.

couplings to the Higgs, enforced by SUSY. It is exactly this relation that
ensures the cancellation of the one-loop quadratic divergence in the Higgs mass
from the top sector. Testing the sum rule experimentally would thus provide a
powerful consistency check on SUSY as the solution to the gauge hierarchy
problem. While such a test will most likely have to await a future
next-generation lepton collider, the LHC experiments may be able to make
significant progress towards this goal. If some of the terms entering the sum
rule are measured at the LHC, the sum rule can be used (within SUSY framework)
to put interesting constraints on the other terms, such as the mixing angles
among third-generation squarks. We outline how the required mass measurements

with the substrate planes. Fluid-fluid and fluid-substrate interactions are
modelled as in our previous work [M. Greschek et al., Soft Matter, 2010,
DOI:10.1039/B924417D). We study several anchoring mechanisms at the solid
substrate by introducing an anchoring function (0<g(u)<1) that depends on the
orientation of a fluid molecule relative to the substrate plane; g(u)
""switches"" the fluid-substrate attraction on or off. Here we focus on various
heterogeneous (i.e., hybrid) anchoring scenarios imposing different anchoring
functions at the opposite substrates. As in our previous study we compute the
isostress heat capacity which allows us to identify states at which the
confined fluid undergoes a structural transformation. The isotropic-nematic
transformation turns out to be nearly independent of the specific anchoring
scenario. This is because the director in the nematic phase assumes a direction
that is a compromise between the directions enforced by the competing anchoring
scenarios at either substrate. On the contrary, at lower compressional stresses
molecules prealign in specific directions that depend on details of the

items receiving a disproportionate share of attention from users. Predicting
which newly-submitted items will become popular is critically important for
both companies that host social media sites and their users. Accurate and
timely prediction would enable the companies to maximize revenue through
differential pricing for access to content or ad placement. Prediction would
also give consumers an important tool for filtering the ever-growing amount of
content. Predicting popularity of content in social media, however, is
challenging due to the complex interactions among content quality, how the
social media site chooses to highlight content, and influence among users.
While these factors make it difficult to predict popularity \emph{a priori}, we
show that stochastic models of user behavior on these sites allows predicting
popularity based on early user reactions to new content. By incorporating
aspects of the web site design, such models improve on predictions based on
simply extrapolating from the early votes. We validate this claim on the social
news portal Digg using a previously-developed model of social voting based on
the Digg user interface.

two low mass X-ray binaries: V404 Cyg and Cen X-4. One important parameter
required in the determination of the mass of the compact objects in these
systems is the binary inclination. We can determine the inclination by modeling
the ellipsoidal modulations of the Roche-lobe filling donor star, but the
contamination of the donor star light from other components of the binary,
particularly the accretion disk, must be taken into account. To this end, we
determined the donor star contribution to the infrared flux by comparing the
spectra of V404 Cyg and Cen X-4 to those of various field K-stars of known
spectral type. For V404 Cyg, we determined that the donor star has a spectral
type of K3 III. We determined the fractional donor contribution to the NIR flux
in the H- and K-bands as $0.98 \pm .05$ and $0.97 \pm .09$, respectively. We
remodeled the H-band light curve from \citet{sanwal1996} after correcting for
the donor star contribution to obtain a new value for the binary inclination.
From this, we determined the mass of the black hole in V404 Cyg to be $M_{BH}=
9.0^{+.2}_{-.6}M_{\odot}$. We performed the same spectral analysis for Cen X-4
and found the spectral type of the donor star to be in the range K5 -- M1V. The
donor star contribution in Cen X-4 is $0.94\pm.14$ in the H-band while in the
K-band, the accretion disk can contribute up to 10% of the infrared flux. We
remodeled the H-band light curve from \citet{shahbaz1993}, again correcting for
the fractional contribution of the donor star to obtain the inclination. From
this, we determined the mass of the neutron star as $M_{NS}=
1.5^{+.1}_{-.4}M_{\odot}$. However, the masses obtained for both systems should
be viewed with some caution since contemporaneous light curve and spectral data
are required to obtain definitive masses.

models that admit both vector and scalar field perturbations. We study the
former to show that it is possible to attain very high, including observable,
values for the levels of non-gaussianity f_{NL} and \tao_{NL} in the bispectrum
B_\zeta and trispectrum T_\zeta of the primordial curvature perturbation \zeta
respectively. Such a result is obtained by taking care of loop corrections in
the spectrum P_\zeta, the bispectrum B_\zeta and the trispectrum T_\zeta .
Sizeable values for f_{NL} and \tao_{NL} arise even if \zeta is generated
during inflation. For the latter we study the spectrum P_\zeta, bispectrum
B_\zeta and trispectrum $T_\zeta of the primordial curvature perturbation when
\zeta is generated by scalar and vector field perturbations. The tree-level and
one-loop contributions from vector field perturbations are worked out
considering the possibility that the one-loop contributions may be dominant

field early-type galaxies. We find that the L_X-L_K relationship is steeper for
field galaxies than for comparable galaxies in groups and clusters. The low hot
gas content of field galaxies with L_K < L_star suggests that internal
processes such as supernovae driven winds or AGN feedback expel hot gas from
low mass galaxies. Such mechanisms may be less effective in groups and clusters
where the presence of an intragroup or intracluster medium can confine
outflowing material. In addition, galaxies in groups and clusters may be able
to accrete gas from the ambient medium. While there is a population of L_K <
L_star galaxies in groups and clusters that retain hot gas halos, some galaxies
in these rich environments, including brighter galaxies, are largely devoid of
hot gas. In these cases, the hot gas halos have likely been removed via ram
pressure stripping. This suggests a very complex interplay between the
intragroup/intracluster medium and hot gas halos of galaxies in rich
environments with the ambient medium helping to confine or even enhance the
halos in some cases and acting to remove gas in others. In contrast, the hot
gas content of more isolated galaxies is largely a function of the mass of the
galaxy, with more massive galaxies able to maintain their halos, while in lower
mass systems the hot gas escapes in outflowing winds.

weighting central halo galaxies by halo mass can significantly suppress their
stochasticity relative to the dark matter, well below the Poisson model
expectation. In this paper we extend this study with the goal of finding the
optimal mass-dependent halo weighting and use $N$-body simulations to perform a
general analysis of halo stochasticity and its dependence on halo mass. We
investigate the stochasticity matrix, defined as $C_{ij}\equiv<(\delta_i
-b_i\delta_m)(\delta_j-b_j\delta_m)>$, where $\delta_m$ is the dark matter
overdensity in Fourier space, $\delta_i$ the halo overdensity of the $i$-th
halo mass bin and $b_i$ the halo bias. In contrast to the Poisson model
predictions we detect nonvanishing correlations between different mass bins. We
also find the diagonal terms to be sub-Poissonian for the highest-mass halos.
The diagonalization of this matrix results in one large and one low eigenvalue,
with the remaining eigenvalues close to the Poisson prediction $1/\bar{n}$,
where $\bar{n}$ is the mean halo number density. The eigenmode with the lowest
eigenvalue contains most of the information and the corresponding eigenvector
provides an optimal weighting function to minimize the stochasticity between
halos and dark matter. We find this optimal weighting function to match linear
mass weighting at high masses, while at the low-mass end the weights approach a
constant whose value depends on the low-mass cut in the halo mass function.
Finally, we employ the halo model to derive the stochasticity matrix and the
scale-dependent bias from an analytical perspective. It is remarkably
successful in reproducing our numerical results and predicts that the
stochasticity between halos and the dark matter can be reduced further when
going to halo masses lower than we can resolve in current simulations.

refinement to guarantee safety and permissiveness. We have implemented the

dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory compactified to four dimensions with
twisted (supersymmetry breaking) boundary conditions. These boundary conditions
lead to a potential for directions in field space that would have been flat
were supersymmetry preserved. For field values in these directions much larger
than the supersymmetry-breaking scale, the flatness of the potential is nearly
restored. Starting in this nearly flat region, inflation can occur as the
theory relaxes towards the origin of field space. Near the origin, the
potential becomes steep and the theory quickly descends to a confining gauge
theory in which the inflaton does not exist as a particle. This confining gauge
theory could be part of the Standard Model (QCD) or a natural dark matter
sector; we comment on various scenarios for reheating. As a specific
illustration of this mechanism, we discuss 4+1 dimensional maximally
supersymmetric gauge theory on a circle with antiperiodic boundary conditions
for fermions. When the theory is weakly coupled at the compactification scale,
we calculate the inflaton potential directly in field theory by integrating out
the heavy W-bosons and their superpartners. At strong coupling the model can be
studied using a gravity dual, which realizes a new model of brane inflation on
a non-supersymmetric throat geometry. Assuming there exists a UV completion
that avoids the eta-problem, predictions from our model are consistent with
present observations, and imply a small tensor-to-scalar ratio.

AGN-driven outflows. These different feedback models result in large variations
in the abundance and structural properties of bright galaxies at z=2. We find
that feedback affects the baryonic mass of a galaxy much more severely than its
spin, which is on average roughly half that of its surrounding dark matter halo
in our runs. Feedback induces strong correlations between angular momentum
content and galaxy mass that leave their imprint on galaxy scaling relations

circular speeds of simulated galaxies formed in such runs have properties that

related phenomena in two-dimensional gauge theories, which realize string
propagation on gerbes. We then discuss the `decomposition conjecture,' equating
conformal field theories of strings on gerbes and strings on disjoint unions of

complete intersections of quadrics, and use the decomposition conjecture to
show that the Landau-Ginzburg points of those models have a geometric
interpretation in terms of a (sometimes noncommutative resolution of a)
branched double cover, realized via nonperturbative effects, rather than as the
vanishing locus of a superpotential. These examples violate old unproven lore

of Bose-Einstein condensation. This bosonic critical point occurs at n lambda^3
approximately 1.3 where n is the density and lambda the thermal wavelength,
which is lower than the ideal gas value of 2.61.

for bulge classification purposes. We confirm, using a much more robust sample,
that the Sersic index of pseudobulges is uncorrelated with other bulge
structural properties, unlike for classical bulges and elliptical galaxies.
Also, the half-light radius of pseudobulges is not correlated with any other
bulge property. We also find a new correlation between surface brightness and
pseudobulge luminosity; pseudobulges become more luminous as they become more
dense. Classical bulges follow the well known scaling relations between surface
brightness, luminosity and half-light radius that are established by elliptical
galaxies. We show that those pseudobulges (as indicated by Sersic index and
nuclear morphology) that have low specific star formation rates are very
similar to models of galaxies in which both a pseudobulge and classical bulge
exist. Therefore, pseudobulge identification that relies only on structural
indicators is incomplete. Our results, especially those on scaling relations,
imply that pseudobulges are very different types of objects than elliptical
galaxies.

growth fluctuations. The fluctuations display characteristic features,
including double exponential scaling in the body of the distribution and power
law scaling of the standard deviation as a function of size. To explain this we
propose a remarkably simple additive replication model: At each step each
individual is replaced by a new number of individuals drawn from the same
replication distribution. If the replication distribution is sufficiently heavy
tailed then the growth fluctuations are Levy distributed. We analyze the data
from bird populations, firms, and mutual funds and show that our predictions
match the data well, in several respects: Our theory results in a much better
collapse of the individual distributions onto a single curve and also correctly
predicts the scaling of the standard deviation with size. To illustrate how
this can emerge from a collective microscopic dynamics we propose a model based
on stochastic influence dynamics over a scale-free contact network and show
that it produces results similar to those observed. We also extend the model to
deal with correlations between individual elements. Our main conclusion is that
the universality of growth fluctuations is driven by the additivity of growth
processes and the action of the generalized central limit theorem.

line emission from low rotational levels of CO, which are sensitive to the CO
mass, and then scaling to the assumed molecular hydrogen H_2 mass. However, a
significant H_2 mass may lie outside the CO region, in the outer regions of the
molecular cloud where the gas phase carbon resides in C or C+. Here, H_2
self-shields or is shielded by dust from UV photodissociation, where as CO is
photodissociated. This H_2 gas is ""dark"" in molecular transitions because of
the absence of CO and other trace molecules, and because H_2 emits so weakly at
temperatures 10 K < T < 100 K typical of this molecular component. This
component has been indirectly observed through other tracers of mass such as
gamma rays produced in cosmic ray collisions with the gas and
far-infrared/submillimeter wavelength dust continuum radiation. In this paper
we theoretically model this dark mass and find that the fraction of the
molecular mass in this dark component is remarkably constant (~ 0.3 for average
visual extinction through the cloud with mean A_V ~ 8) and insensitive to the
incident ultraviolet radiation field strength, the internal density
distribution, and the mass of the molecular cloud as long as mean A_V, or
equivalently, the product of the average hydrogen nucleus column and the
metallicity through the cloud, is constant. We also find that the dark mass
fraction increases with decreasing mean A_V, since relatively more molecular
H_2 material lies outside the CO region in this case.

Spectrometer (EIS) onboard the Hinode solar space observatory are studied using
multi Gaussian fits, with emphasis on the resulting line widths and Doppler
shifts. In the major part of the active region, the spectra are best fit by a
narrow line core and a broad minor component. The latter contributes some 10%
to 20% to the total emission, is about a factor of 2 broader than the core, and
shows strong blueshifts of up to 50 km/s. On average, the line width increases
from the footpoints to the loop top for both components. A component with high
upflow speeds can be found also in small restricted areas. The coronal
structures consist of at least two classes that are not resolved spatially but
only spectroscopically and that are associated with the line core and the minor
component. Because of their huge line width and strong upflows, it is proposed
that the major part of the heating and the mass supply to the corona is
actually located in source regions of the minor component. The siphon flows and
draining loops seen in the line core component are consistent with structures
found in a 3D MHD coronal model. Despite the quite different appearance of the

nearby cluster Abell 3827 by analyzing Gemini South GMOS images. The most
prominent strong lensing feature is a highly-magnified, ring-shaped
configuration of four images around the central cD galaxy. GMOS spectroscopic
analysis puts this source at z~0.2. Located ~20"" away from the central galaxy
is a secondary tangential arc feature which has been identified as a background
galaxy with z~0.4. We have modeled the gravitational potential of the cluster
core, taking into account the mass from the cluster, the BCG and other
galaxies. We derive a total mass of (2.7 +- 0.4) x 10^13 Msun within 37 h^-1
kpc. This mass is an order of magnitude larger than that derived from X-ray
observations. The total mass derived from lensing data suggests that the BCG in
this cluster is perhaps the most massive galaxy in the nearby Universe.

accompanied by an electromagnetic (EM) afterglow, produced by the viscous
infall of the surrounding circumbinary gas disk after the merger. It has been
proposed that once the merger has been detected in gravitational waves (GWs) by
LISA, follow-up EM searches for this afterglow can help identify the EM
counterpart of the LISA source. Here we study whether the afterglows may be
sufficiently bright and numerous to be detectable in EM surveys alone. The
viscous afterglow, which lasts for years to decades for SMBHBs in LISA's
sensitivity window, is characterized by rapid increases in both the bolometric
luminosity and in the spectral hardness of the source. If quasar activity is
triggered by the same major galaxy mergers that produce SMBHBs, then the
afterglow could be interpreted as a signature of the birth of a quasar. Using
an idealized model for the post-merger viscous spreading of the circumbinary
disk and the resulting light curve, and using the observed luminosity function
of quasars as a proxy for the SMBHB merger rate, we delineate the survey
requirements for identifying such birthing quasars. If circumbinary disks have
a high disk surface density and viscosity, an all-sky soft X-ray survey with a
sensitivity of ~<3x10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 and a time resolution of ~months could
identify dozens of birthing quasars with sustained brightening rates of
>10%/yr. If >1% of the X-ray emission is reprocessed into optical frequencies,
birthing quasars could also be identified in optical transient surveys such as
the LSST. Distinguishing a birthing quasar from other variable sources may be
facilitated by the monotonic hardening of its spectrum, but will likely remain
challenging. This reinforces the notion that joint EM-plus-GW observations
offer the best prospects for identifying the EM signatures of SMBHB mergers.

an unprecedented level of success in reproducing much of the observed orbital
architecture of the solar system by evolving the planets to their current
locations from a more compact configuration. Within the context of this model,
the formation of the classical Kuiper belt requires a phase during which the
ice giants have a high eccentricity. An outstanding question of this model is
the initial configuration from which the Solar System started out. Recent work
has shown that multi-resonant initial conditions can serve as good candidates,
as they naturally prevent vigorous type-II migration. In this paper, we use
analytical arguments, as well as self-consistent numerical N-body simulations
to identify fully-resonant initial conditions, whose dynamical evolution is
characterized by an eccentric phase of the ice-giants, as well as planetary
scattering. We find a total of eight such initial conditions. Four of these
primordial states are compatible with the canonical ""Nice"" model, while the
others imply slightly different evolutions. The results presented here should
prove useful in further development of a comprehensive model for solar system
formation.

hypotheses have appeared trying to explain the presence of these gullies. The
main hypotheses are the ones which suggest that some liquid, water or CO2, was
responsible for modeling the gullies and ones that propose dry flows as the
modeling agents. The aim of this work is to develop an alternative hypotetical
mechanism of formation of Martian gullies.Our model proposes that the Martian
gullies were formed as a result of a fluidization process of the material
deposited on the slopes of the impact craters, plateaux and other
geomorphologic structures. This fluidization is caused by the sublimation of
carbon dioxide ice deposited in the form of snow, due to the daily and seasonal
temperature changes. We also present the results of an experimental
simulation.Structures similar to the Martian gullies were reproduced using the
air injection mechanism, as a substitute to gaseous CO2, on a sandy slope. The
Reynolds number for our experimental flow and for the flow in the Martian
gullies was calculated and we found that they are of the same order, whilst the
water flows have much higher Reynolds numbers.Taking into account the current
environmental conditions for Mars, from our results it may be suggested that
this mechanism is the possible modeling agent for the Martian gullies. Two of
the most important characteristics of the proposed model are: a) It offers a
simple explanation of how recurrent fluidization events occur in the same
place, a necessary recurrence of the formation of a gully, offering a
recharging mechanism for the system after every fluidization event, and b) It
considers the formation of gullies possible even in angles smaller than the
angle of repose. These characteristics of the model solve these two problems
present in current theories.

Carleson as a toy model for the dynamics of the so-called H\'enon maps. We show
that Smale's Axiom A property is $C^1$-dense among the systems in this family,
despite the existence of $C^2$-open subsets (closely related to the so-called
Newhouse phenomena) where Smale's Axiom A is violated. In particular, this
provides some evidence towards Smale's conjecture that Axiom A is a $C^1$-dense
property among surface diffeomorphisms.
  The basic tools in the proof of this result are: 1) a recent theorem of
Moreira saying that stable intersections of dynamical Cantor sets (one of the
main obstructions to Axiom A property for surface diffeomorphisms) can be
destroyed by $C^1$-perturbations; 2) the good geometry of the dynamical
critical set (in the sense of Rodriguez-Hertz and Pujals) thanks to the
particular form of Benedicks-Carleson toy models.

on the quantum hydrodynamics of this system. Since the discovery of superfluid

opened new possibilities, because it became possible to control and directly
visualize condensates and quantized vortices. Historically, many ideas
developed in superfluid 4He and 3He have been imported to the field of cold

formation. Because of the ellipticity of the electron pocket and the fact that
only one of the electron pockets is involved in the SDW, the resulting QPI has
a pronounced one-dimensional structure. We further predict that the QPI crosses
over to two-dimensionality on an energy scale, set by the SDW gap, which we
estimate from neutron scattering data to be around 90 meV.

probabilities from thermal-activated barrier hurdling, direct LZ tunneling, and
thermal-assisted LZ tunnelings in the presence of sweeping magnetic fields. We
do systematical DMC simulations for Mn$_{12}$ systems with various temperatures

low-temperature magnetization curves, and our results show that the thermally

the thermal-assisted tunnelings play important roles at intermediate
temperature. These are consistent with corresponding experimental results on
good Mn$_{12}$ samples (with less disorders) in the presence of little
misalignments between the easy axis and applied magnetic fields, and therefore
our magnetization curves are satisfactory. Furthermore, our DMC results show
that the MDI, with the thermal effects, have important effects on the LZ
tunneling processes, but both the MDI and the LZ tunneling give place to the
thermal-activated barrier hurdling effect in determining the magnetization
curves when the temperature is near 3K. This DMC approach can be applicable to
other SMM systems, and could be used to study other properties of SMM systems.

(2009) examined the question ""Do Bars Drive Spiral
Density Waves?"", an idea supported by theoretical studies and also from a
preliminary observational analysis Block etal (2004). They estimated maximum
bar strengths Q_b, maximum spiral strengths Q_s, and maximum m=2 arm contrasts
A_2s for 23 galaxies with deep AAT K_s-band images. These were combined with
previously published Q_b and Q_s values for 147 galaxies from the OSUBSGS
sample and with the 12 galaxies from Block etal(2004). Weak correlation between
Q_b and Q_s was confirmed for the combined sample, whereas the AAT subset alone
showed no significant correlations between Q_b and Q_s, nor between Q_b and
A_2s. A similar negative result was obtained in Durbala etal. (2009) for 46
galaxies. Based on these studies, the answer to the above question remains
uncertain. Here we use a novel approach, and show that although the correlation
between the maximum bar and spiral parameters is weak, these parameters do
correlate when compared locally. For the OSUBSGS sample a statistically
significant correlation is found between the local spiral amplitude, and the
forcing due to the bar's potential at the same distance, out to 1.6 bar radii
(the typical bar perturbation is then of the order of a few percent). Also for
the sample of 23 AAT galaxies we find a significant correlation between local
parameters out to 1.4 bar radii. Our new results confirm that, at least in a
statistical sense, bars do indeed drive spiral density waves.

substitutions over various protein families by sacrificing gene-level
resolution. We develop a codon-based model, in which mutational tendencies of
codon, a genetic code, and the strength of selective constraints against amino
acid replacements can be tailored to a given gene. First, selective constraints
averaged over proteins are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of each 1-PAM
matrix of empirical amino acid (JTT, WAG, and LG) and codon (KHG) substitution
matrices. Then, selective constraints specific to given proteins are
approximated as a linear function of those estimated from the empirical
substitution matrices.
  Akaike information criterion (AIC) values indicate that a model allowing
multiple nucleotide changes fits the empirical substitution matrices
significantly better. Also, the ML estimates of transition-transversion bias
obtained from these empirical matrices are not so large as previously
estimated. The selective constraints are characteristic of proteins rather than
species. However, their relative strengths among amino acid pairs can be
approximated not to depend very much on protein families but amino acid pairs,
because the present model, in which selective constraints are approximated to
be a linear function of those estimated from the JTT/WAG/LG/KHG matrices, can
provide a good fit to other empirical substitution matrices including cpREV for
chloroplast proteins and mtREV for vertebrate mitochondrial proteins.
  The present codon-based model with the ML estimates of selective constraints
and with adjustable mutation rates of nucleotide would be useful as a simple
substitution model in ML and Bayesian inferences of molecular phylogenetic
trees, and enables us to obtain biologically meaningful information at both
nucleotide and amino acid levels from codon and protein sequences.

Rayleigh-Taylor instability cannot be killed by the stabilizing thermal and
mu-gradients, so that the GSF instability is always there and we derive the
corresponding diffusion coefficient. The GSF instability grows towards the very
latest stages of stellar evolution. Close to the deep convective zones in
pre-supernova stages, the transport coefficient of elements and angular
momentum by the GSF instability can very locally be larger than the shear
instability and even as large as the thermal diffusivity. However the zones
over which the GSF instability is acting are extremely narrow and there is not
enough time left before the supernova explosion for a significant mixing to
occur. Thus, even when the inhibiting effects of the mu-gradient are reduced by
the horizontal turbulence, the GSF instability remains insignificant for the
evolution. We conclude that the GSF instability in pre-supernova stages cannot
be held responsible for the relatively low rotation rate of pulsars compared to
the predictions of rotating star models.

multigraded $R$-module, let $\beta_{i,\alpha}(L)$ the $i$th (multigraded) Betti

Hochster-type formula for $\beta_{i,\alpha}(L)$ as the dimension of the reduced

show that there is precisely one homological degree $i\ge 1$ in which
$\beta_{i,\alpha}(L)$ is non-zero and in this homological degree the Betti

systems. Studying the dynamics and formation of these systems can provide
valuable informations on processes taking place in protoplanetary disks where
the planets are thought have been formed. The recently discovered resonant
system HD 60532 is the only confirmed case, in which the central star hosts a
pair of giant planets in 3:1 mean motion resonance. We intend to provide a
physical scenario for the formation of HD 60532, which is consistent with the
orbital solutions derived from the radial velocity measurements. Observations
indicate that the system is in an antisymmetric configuration, while previous
theoretical investigations indicate an asymmetric equilibrium state. The paper
aims at answering this discrepancy as well. We performed two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations of thin disks with an embedded pair of massive
planets. Additionally, migration and resonant capture are studied by
gravitational N-body simulations that apply properly parametrized
non-conservative forces. Our simulations suggest that the capture into the 3:1
mean motion resonance takes place only for higher planetary masses, thus
favouring orbital solutions having relatively smaller inclination i=20 degrees.
The system formed by numerical simulations qualitatively show the same
behaviour as HD 60532. We also find that the presence of an inner disk (between
the inner planet and the star) plays a very important role in determining the
final configurations of resonant planetary systems. Its damping effect on the
inner planet's eccentricity is responsible for the observed antisymmetric state
of HD 60532.

interest N_e = 60, and for models of inflation such as new inflation, natural
inflation and running mass inflation \xi is large compared to the slow roll
parameter \epsilon ~ V'^{2}. Therefore the contribution from self interactions
should not be outrightly ignored while retaining other terms in the

growth of non-gaussianities outside the horizon. Therefore we briefly discuss
the issue of the constancy of correlations of the curvature perturbation \zeta

parameters in two ways: i) We consider the faintest (brightest) galaxies in
each sample and we progressively increase the width of the magnitude interval
by inclusion of the brighter (fainter) galaxies
(increasing-magnitude-intervals), and ii) we consider narrow-magnitude
intervals of the same width ($\Delta M = 1.0$ $mag$) over the whole magnitude
range available (narrow-magnitude-intervals). Our main results are that: i) in
both increasing and narrow-magnitude-intervals the Faber-Jackson relation
parameters change systematically, ii) non-parametric tests show that the
fluctuations in the values of the slope of the Faber-Jackson relation are not
products of chance variations. We conclude that the values of the Faber-Jackson
relation parameters depend on the width of the magnitude range and the
luminosity of galaxies within the magnitude range. This dependence is caused,
to a great extent by the selection effects and because the geometrical shape of
the distribution of galaxies on the $M - \log (\sigma_{0})$ plane depends on
luminosity. We therefore emphasize that if the luminosity of galaxies or the
width of the magnitude range or both are not taken into consideration when
comparing the structural relations of galaxy samples for different wavelengths,
environments, redshifts and luminosities, any differences found may be
misinterpreted.

integrable. Its phase space is a symplectic manifold of dimension $2n$, which
is mostly foliated with Liouville tori of dimension $n$. The motion on each
Liouville torus becomes just a parallel translation with some frequency
$\omega$ that varies with the torus. Besides, any billiard trajectory inside
$Q$ is tangent to $n$ caustics $Q_{\lambda_1},...,Q_{\lambda_n}$, so the
caustic parameters $\lambda=(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n)$ are integrals of the
billiard map. The frequency map $\lambda \mapsto \omega$ is a key tool to
understand the structure of periodic billiard trajectories. In principle, it is
well-defined only for nonsingular values of the caustic parameters. We present
four conjectures, fully supported by numerical experiments. The last one gives
rise to some lower bounds on the periods. These bounds only depend on the type
of the caustics. We describe the geometric meaning, domain, and range of
$\omega$. The map $\omega$ can be continuously extended to singular values of
the caustic parameters, although it becomes ""exponentially sharp"" at some of
them. Finally, we study triaxial ellipsoids of $\Rset^3$. We compute
numerically the bifurcation curves in the parameter space on which the
Liouville tori with a fixed frequency disappear. We determine which ellipsoids
have more periodic trajectories. We check that the previous lower bounds on the
periods are optimal, by displaying periodic trajectories with periods four,
five, and six whose caustics have the right types. We also give some new

Radio Telescope, we examine the interaction between the intracluster medium and
central radio source in the poor cluster AWM 4. In the Chandra observation a
small cool core or galactic corona is resolved coincident with the radio core.
This corona is capable of fuelling the active nucleus, but must be
inefficiently heated by jet interactions or conduction, possibly precluding a
feedback relationship between the radio source and cluster. A lack of clearly
detected X-ray cavities suggests that the radio lobes are only partially filled
by relativistic plasma. We estimate a filling factor of phi=0.21 (3 sigma upper
limit phi<0.42) for the better constrained east lobe. We consider the particle
population in the jets and lobes, and find that the standard equipartition
assumptions predict pressures and ages which agree poorly with X-ray estimates.
Including an electron population extending to low Lorentz factors either
reduces (gamma_min=100) or removes (gamma_min=10) the pressure imbalance
between the lobes and their environment. Pressure balance can also be achieved
by entrainment of thermal gas, probably in the first few kiloparsecs of the
radio jets. We estimate the mechanical power output of the radio galaxy, and
find it to be marginally capable of balancing radiative cooling.

established as a method to describe complex ligand binding equilibriums
measured in vitro with purified DNA and protein components. Recently, a new
field of applications has opened up for this approach since it has become
possible to experimentally quantify genome-wide protein occupancies in relation
to the DNA sequence. In particular, the organization of the eukaryotic genome
by histone proteins into a nucleoprotein complex termed chromatin has been
recognized as a key parameter that controls the access of transcription factors
to the DNA sequence. New approaches have to be developed to derive statistical
mechanical lattice descriptions of chromatin-associated protein-DNA
interactions. Here, we present the theoretical framework for lattice models of
histone-DNA interactions in chromatin and investigate the (competitive) DNA
binding of other chromosomal proteins and transcription factors. The results
have a number of applications for quantitative models for the regulation of
gene expression.

in zero the first passage time of a given level is distributed as a sum of
independent exponentially distributed random variables, the parameters of which
are the negatives of the eigenvalues of the stopped process. Recently, Diaconis
and Miclo have given a probabilistic proof of this fact by constructing a
coupling between a general birth-and-death process and a process whose birth
rates are the negatives of the eigenvalues, ordered from high to low, and whose
death rates are zero, in such a way that the latter process is always ahead of
the former, and both arrive at the same time at the given level. In this note,
we extend their methods by constructing a third process, whose birth rates are
the negatives of the eigenvalues ordered from low to high and whose death rates
are zero, which always lags behind the original process and also arrives at the
same time.

directions of B and for every pair of terminals t_i and t_j, the network N(T)
contains a shortest B-path between them, i.e., a path of length || t_i - t_j

possible length. The problem of finding minimum B-Manhattan networks has been
introduced by Gudmundsson, Levcopoulos, and Narasimhan (APPROX'99) in the case
when the unit ball B is a square (and hence the distance || p - q || is the l_1

Chin, Guo, and Sun (SoCG'09) to be strongly NP-complete. Several approximation
algorithms (with factors 8, 4 ,3 , and 2) for minimum Manhattan problem are
known. In this paper, we propose a factor 2.5 approximation algorithm for

of the strip-staircase decomposition proposed in our paper (APPROX'05) and
subsequently used in other factor 2 approximation algorithms for minimum

demonstrating that this epoch can be fully characterized by the so-called

Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropies Probe (WMAP7) data for all large and small
field models. An interesting feature of our approach is that it yields lower
bounds on the reheating temperature which can be combined with the upper bounds
associated with gravitinos production. For large field models, we find the
energy scale of reheating to be higher than those probed at the Large Hadron

obtain the two-sigma lower limits Ereh > 890 TeV for a mean equation of state
during reheating <wreh> = -0.3 and Ereh > 390 GeV for <wreh> = -0.2. The
physical origin of these constraints is pedagogically explained by means of the
slow-roll approximation. Finally, when marginalizing over all possible
reheating history, the WMAP7 data push massive inflation under pressure (p <

correlated stationary ergodic multivariate process. Each sample is passed
through an N-point quantizer and transmitted to a decision device which
performs a binary hypothesis test. For any false alarm level, it is shown that
the miss probability of the Neyman-Pearson test converges to zero exponentially
as the number of samples tends to infinity, assuming that the observed process
satisfies certain mixing conditions. The main contribution of this paper is to
provide a compact closed-form expression of the error exponent in the high-rate
regime i.e., when the number N of quantization levels tends to infinity,
generalizing previous results of Gupta and Hero to the case of non-independent
observations. If d represents the dimension of one sample, it is proved that
the error exponent converges at rate N^{2/d} to the one obtained in the absence
of quantization. As an application, relevant high-rate quantization strategies
which lead to a large error exponent are determined. Numerical results indicate

Previously-known countermeasures have been grossly inadequate. If this attack

trusting trust attack can be detected and effectively countered using the
""Diverse Double-Compiling"" (DDC) technique, as demonstrated by (1) a formal
proof that DDC can determine if source code and generated executable code
correspond, (2) a demonstration of DDC with four compilers (a small C compiler,
a small Lisp compiler, a small maliciously corrupted Lisp compiler, and a large
industrial-strength C compiler, GCC), and (3) a description of approaches for
applying DDC in various real-world scenarios. In the DDC technique, source code

traffic modeling, the theory of traffic congestion on freeways is still highly
controversial. In this contribution, we compare Kerner's three-phase traffic
theory with the phase diagram approach for traffic models with a fundamental
diagram. We discuss the inconsistent use of the term ""traffic phase"" and show
that patterns demanded by three-phase traffic theory can be reproduced with
simple two-phase models, if the model parameters are suitably specified and
factors characteristic for real traffic flows are considered, such as effects
of noise or heterogeneity or the actual freeway design (e.g. combinations of
off- and on-ramps). Conversely, we demonstrate that models created to reproduce
three-phase traffic theory create similar spatiotemporal traffic states and
associated phase diagrams, no matter whether the parameters imply a fundamental
diagram in equilibrium or non-unique flow- density relationships. In
conclusion, there are different ways of reproducing the empirical stylized
facts of spatiotemporal congestion patterns summarized in this contribution,
and it appears possible to overcome the controversy by a more precise
definition of the scientific terms and a more careful comparison of models and
data, considering effects of the measurement process and the right level of
detail in the traffic model used.

carrier density, temperature, and applied perpendicular electrical displacement
D. As a band gap is induced with increasing D, the compressibility minimum at
charge neutrality becomes deeper but remains finite, suggesting the presence of
localized states within the energy gap. Temperature dependent capacitance
measurements show that compressibility is sensitive to the intrinsic band gap.
For large displacements, an additional peak appears in the compressibility as a
function of density, corresponding to the presence of a 1-dimensional van Hove
singularity (vHs) at the band edge arising from the quartic bilayer graphene
band structure. For D > 0, the additional peak is observed only for electrons,
while D < 0 the peak appears only for holes. This asymmetry that can be
understood in terms of the finite interlayer separation and may be useful as a
direct probe of the layer polarization.

which states that the class of stochastic processes $S$ allowing for a useful
integration theory consists precisely of those processes which can be written
in the form $S=M+A$, where $M$ is a local martingale and $A$ is a finite
variation process. In other words, $S$ is a good integrator if and only if it
is a semi-martingale. We obtain this decomposition rather directly from an
elementary discrete-time Doob-Meyer decomposition. By passing to convex
combinations we obtain a direct construction of the continuous time
decomposition, which then yields the desired decomposition. As a by-product of
our proof we obtain a characterization of semi-martingales in terms of a
variant of \emph{no free lunch}, thus extending a result from [DeSc94].

(ATB) field-effect transistor geometry is presented. The effective
electrostatic scaling length, {\lambda}eff, is extracted from the analytical
model, which cannot be approximated by the lowest order eigenmode as
traditionally done in SOI-MOSFETs. An empirical equation for the scaling length
that depends on the geometry parameters is proposed. It is shown that even for
a thick SiO2 back oxide {\lambda}eff can be improved efficiently by thinner top
oxide thickness, and to some extent, with high-k dielectrics. The model is then
applied to self-consistent simulation of graphene nanoribbon (GNR)
Schottky-barrier field-effect transistors (SB-FETs) at the ballistic limit. In
the case of GNR SB-FETs, for large {\lambda}eff, the scaling is limited by the
conventional electrostatic short channel effects (SCEs). On the other hand, for
small {\lambda}eff, the scaling is limited by direct source-to-drain tunneling.
A subthreshold swing below 100mV/dec is still possible with a sub-10nm gate
length in GNR SB-FETs.

in nano-scale lasers and single-photon sources, and has therefore been the
focus of much research. However, to date, high electric fields and currents
have been either required for electroluminescence, or have been an undesired
side effect, leading to high power requirements and low efficiencies. In
addition, electroluminescent linewidths have been broad enough to obscure the
contributions of individual optical transitions. Here, we report
electrically-induced light emission from individual carbon nanotube p-n diodes.
A new level of control over electrical carrier injection is achieved, reducing
power dissipation by a factor of up to 1000, and resulting in zero threshold
current, negligible self-heating, and high carrier-to- photon conversion
efficiencies. Moreover, the electroluminescent spectra are significantly
narrower (ca. 35 meV) than in previous studies, allowing the identification of
emission from free and localized excitons.

Generalized Diagonal Wythoff Nim (GDWN). The story begins with 2-pile Nim whose
sets of options and $P$-positions are $\{\{0,t\}\mid t\in \N\}$ and
$\{(t,t)\mid t\in \M \}$ respectively. If we to 2-pile Nim adjoin the
main-\emph{diagonal} $\{(t,t)\mid t\in \N\}$ as options, the new game is
Wythoff Nim. It is well-known that the $P$-positions of this game lie on two
'beams' originating at the origin with slopes $\Phi= \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}>1$
and $\frac{1}{\Phi} < 1$. Hence one may think of this as if, in the process of
going from Nim to Wythoff Nim, the set of $P$-positions has \emph{split} and
landed some distance off the main diagonal. This geometrical observation has
motivated us to ask the following intuitive question. Does this splitting of
the set of $P$-positions continue in some meaningful way if we, to the game of
Wythoff Nim, adjoin some new \emph{generalized diagonal} move, that is a move
of the form $\{pt, qt\}$, where $0 < p < q$ are fixed positive integers and $t
> 0$? Does the answer perhaps depend on the specific values of $p$ and $q$? We
state three conjectures of which the weakest form is: $\lim_{t\in
\N}\frac{b_t}{a_t}$ exists, and equals $\Phi$, if and only if $(p, q)$ is a
certain \emph{non-splitting pair}, and where $\{\{a_t, b_t\}\}$ represents the
set of $P$-positions of the new game. Then we prove this conjecture for the
special case $(p,q) = (1,2)$ (a \emph{splitting pair}). We prove the other
direction whenever $q / p < \Phi$. In the Appendix, a variety of experimental
data is included, aiming to point out some directions for future work on GDWN
games.
