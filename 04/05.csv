7000 combinations. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) classifier has been used
successfully to recognize facial action units (AUs) and expressions due to its
ability to deal with AU dynamics. However, a separate HMM is necessary for each
single AU and each AU combination. Since combinations of AU numbering in
thousands, a more efficient method will be needed. In this paper an accurate
real-time sequence-based system for representation and recognition of facial
AUs is presented. Our system has the following characteristics: 1) employing a
mixture of HMMs and neural network, we develop a novel accurate classifier,
which can deal with AU dynamics, recognize subtle changes, and it is also
robust to intensity variations, 2) although we use an HMM for each single AU
only, by employing a neural network we can recognize each single and
combination AU, and 3) using both geometric and appearance-based features, and
applying efficient dimension reduction techniques, our system is robust to
illumination changes and it can represent the temporal information involved in
formation of the facial expressions. Extensive experiments on Cohn-Kanade
database show the superiority of the proposed method, in comparison with other
classifiers. Keywords: classifier design and evaluation, data fusion, facial
action units (AUs), hidden Markov models (HMMs), neural network (NN).

relations for the A, D, E family of caustic singularities, which were
established in recent work. In particular, it was shown that for families of
general mappings between planes exhibiting any of these caustic singularities,
and for any non-caustic target point, the total signed magnification of the
corresponding pre-images vanishes. As an application to gravitational lensing,
it was also shown that, independent of the choice of a lens model, the total
signed magnification vanishes for a light source anywhere in the four-image
region close to elliptic and hyperbolic umbilic caustics. This is a more global
and higher-order analog of the well-known fold and cusp magnification
relations. We now extend each of these mappings to weighted projective space,
which is a compact orbifold, and show that magnification relations translate
into a statement about the behavior of these extended mappings at infinity.
This generalizes multi-dimensional residue techniques developed in previous
work, and introduces weighted projective space as a new tool in the theory of
caustic singularities and gravitational lensing.

Al-, Si-, P-, Cr- and Mn-doped graphene. The local curvature caused by the
large bond length of X-C (X represents the dopants) relative to CC bond plays a
very important role in this chemisorption. The chemisorption of O2 induces
dramatic changes of electronic structures and localized spin polarization of
doped graphene, and in particular, chemisorption of O2 on Cr-doped graphene is
antiferromagnetic. The analysis of electronic density of states shows the
contribution of the hybridization between O and dopants is mainly from the p or
d orbitals. Furthermore, spin density shows that the magnetization locates
mainly around the doped atoms, which may be responsible for the Kondo effect.
These special properties supply a good choice to control the electronic

Tonomura et al. in 1982 and 1986 with toroidal magnets that gave a strong

paper we prove that our results do not depend on the particular geometry of the

experiments, and on the gaussian shape of the wave packets used to obtain our
quantitative error bound. We consider a general class of magnets that are a
finite union of handle bodies. We formulate the Aharonov-bohm Ansatz that is
appropriate to this general case and we prove that the exact solution to the
Schroedinger equation is given by the Aharonov-Bohm Ansatz up to an error bound
in norm that is uniform in time and that decays as a constant divided by

potential can be chosen as a function of the areal radius to yield specific
non-singular static spherically symmetric solutions that generically have two
horizons. For a specific choice of potential the effective stress energy tensor
violates only the dominant energy condition. The violations are maximum near
the inner horizon and die off rapidly. A numerical study of the quantum
corrected collapse of a spherically symmetric scalar field in this case reveals
that the modified gravitational potential prevents the formation of a central
singularity and ultimately yields a static, mostly vacuum, spacetime with two

inflation at late times. The Cauchy horizon is transformed into a null, weak

Turaev cobracket factors through $\mu$, so we can view $\mu$ as a
generalization of $\Delta$. We show that Turaev's conjecture holds when
$\Delta$ is replaced with $\mu$. We also show that $\mu(\alpha)$ gives an
explicit formula for the minimum number of self-intersection points of a loop
in $\alpha$. The operation $\mu$ also satisfies identities similar to the
co-Jacobi and coskew symmetry identities, so while $\mu$ is not a cobracket,
$\mu$ behaves like a Lie cobracket for the Andersen-Mattes-Reshetikhin Poisson
algebra.

  Balancing Algorithm in Cellular Network","accepted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing",,,,"cs.NI cs.IT cs.PF math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an analytical framework for modeling a priority-based load
balancing scheme in cellular networks based on a new algorithm called direct
retry with truncated offloading channel resource pool (DR$_{K}$). The model,
developed for a baseline case of two cell network, differs in many respects
from previous works on load balancing. Foremost, it incorporates the call
admission process, through random access. In specific, the proposed model
implements the Physical Random Access Channel used in 3GPP network standards.
Furthermore, the proposed model allows the differentiation of users based on
their priorities. The quantitative results illustrate that, for example,
cellular network operators can control the manner in which traffic is offloaded
between neighboring cells by simply adjusting the length of the random access
phase. Our analysis also allows for the quantitative determination of the
blocking probability individual users will experience given a specific length
of random access phase. Furthermore, we observe that the improvement in
blocking probability per shared channel for load balanced users using DR$_{K}$
is maximized at an intermediate number of shared channels, as opposed to the
maximum number of these shared resources. This occurs because a balance is
achieved between the number of users requesting connections and those that are
already admitted to the network. We also present an extension of our analytical
model to a multi-cell network (by means of an approximation) and an application
of the proposed load balancing scheme in the context of opportunistic spectrum
access.

symmetry breaking is described by the Higgs mechanism which includes a scalar
Higgs boson. Electroweak measurements constrain the Standard Model Higgs boson
mass to be in the 114.4 to 157 GeV/c^2 range. Within this mass window, the
Higgs predominantly decays into two b-quarks. As such, we investigate the
prospect of observing the Standard Model Higgs decaying to b\bar{b} produced in
weak-boson-fusion with an associated central photon. An isolated, high pt,
central photon trigger is expected to be available at the ATLAS and CMS

showering, hadronization, the underlying event model, and jet performance
including b-jet calibration on the sensitivity of this channel. We found that
the choice of Monte Carlo and Monte Carlo tune has a large effect on the
efficacy of the central jet veto and consequently the signal significance. A
signal significance of about 1.86 can be achieved for m(Higgs)=115 GeV/c^2 with
100 1/fb of integrated luminosity which correspond to one year at design

is a companion, we have obtained images of the pair at a second epoch with the
adaptive optics system at Gemini Observatory. The astrometry from the Hubble

thus are likely companions. We estimate a mass of 5-10 Mjup for the secondary
based on a comparison of its bolometric luminosity to the predictions of
theoretical evolutionary models. This object demonstrates that planetary-mass
companions to brown dwarfs can form on a timescale of <=1 Myr. Companion
formation on such a rapid timescale is more likely to occur via gravitational
instability in a disk or fragmentation of a cloud core than through core
accretion. The Gemini images also reveal a possible substellar companion
(rho=0.23"") to a young low-mass star that is 12.4"" from the brown dwarf
targeted by Hubble. If these four objects comprise a quadruple system, then its
hierarchical configuration would suggest that the fragmentation of molecular
cloud cores can produce companions below 10 Mjup.

throughput of wireless systems. Herein, control strategies which enable the
superposition in time and frequency of primary and secondary user transmissions
are explored in contrast to more traditional sensing approaches which only
allow the secondary user to transmit when the primary user is idle. In this
work, the optimal transmission policy for the secondary user when the primary
user adopts a retransmission based error control scheme is investigated. The
policy aims to maximize the secondary users' throughput, with a constraint on
the throughput loss and failure probability of the primary user. Due to the
constraint, the optimal policy is randomized, and determines how often the
secondary user transmits according to the retransmission state of the packet
being served by the primary user. The resulting optimal strategy of the
secondary user is proven to have a unique structure. In particular, the optimal
throughput is achieved by the secondary user by concentrating its transmission,
and thus its interference to the primary user, in the first transmissions of a
primary user packet. The rather simple framework considered in this paper
highlights two fundamental aspects of cognitive networks that have not been
covered so far: (i) the networking mechanisms implemented by the primary users
(error control by means of retransmissions in the considered model) react to
secondary users' activity; (ii) if networking mechanisms are considered, then
their state must be taken into account when optimizing secondary users'
strategy, i.e., a strategy based on a binary active/idle perception of the
primary users' state is suboptimal.

exhibited hysteresis. Furthermore, when the magnetic field was set to zero, a

numerically, following his formulation, whether trapped g-mode oscillations in
a warped disk, where the warp amplitude varies with radius, can be excited by
this mechanism. For simplicity, we adopt Newtonian hydrodynamic equations with
relativistic expressions for the characteristic frequencies of disks. We also
assume that the accretion disk is isothermal. We find that the fundamental
modes of trapped g-mode oscillations with eigenfrequencies close to the maximum
of epycyclic frequency are excited. The intermediate oscillations found are
isolated in a narrow region around the resonance radius. After varying some

significantly more restrictive in R-symmetric models since this process can
occur through operators that do not require a chirality-flip. We delineate the
allowed parameter space, demonstrating that maximal mixing is rarely possible
with weak scale superpartners, while O(0.1) mixing is permitted within most of
the space. The best approach to find or rule out mu/e mixing in R-symmetric
supersymmetric models is a multi-pronged attack looking at both mu to e
conversion as well as mu to e gamma. The redundancy eliminates much of the

the consistency of theories. For scenarios where the Lorentz transformations
remain valid these consistency conditions allow us to characterize the
violations of Lorentz symmetry through an explicit description of the
modification of the quantum-gravity scale in boosted frames with respect to its
definition in a preferred frame. When applied to relativistic scenarios with a
deformation of Lorentz invariance that preserves the equivalence of inertial
observers, we find an insightful characterization of the necessity to adopt in
such frameworks non-classical features of spacetime geometry, e.g. events that
are at the same spacetime point for one observer cannot be considered at the

in the vacuum on a stable circular orbit in a spherically symmetric geometry,
is derived. The tangential velocity depends on the metric tensor components, as
well as of the coupling function between matter and geometry. The Doppler
velocity shifts are also obtained in terms of the coupling function. If the
tangential velocity profile is known, the coupling term between matter and
geometry can be obtained explicitly in an analytical form. The functional form
of this function is obtained in two cases, for a constant tangential velocity,
and for an empirical velocity profile obtained from astronomical observations,
respectively. Therefore, these results open the possibility of directly testing
the modified gravity models with non-minimal coupling between matter and
geometry by using direct astronomical and astrophysical observations at the
galactic or extra-galactic scale.

each other's packets exposes them to a wide range of security attacks. A
particularly devastating attack is the wormhole attack, where a malicious node
records control traffic at one location and tunnels it to another compromised
node, possibly far away, which replays it locally. Routing security in ad hoc
networks is often equated with strong and feasible node authentication and
lightweight cryptography. Unfortunately, the wormhole attack can hardly be
defeated by crypto graphical measures, as wormhole attackers do not create
separate packets. They simply replay packets already existing on the network,
which pass the cryptographic checks. Existing works on wormhole detection have
often focused on detection using specialized hardware, such as directional
antennas, etc. In this paper, we present a cluster based counter-measure for
the wormhole attack, that alleviates these drawbacks and efficiently mitigates
the wormhole attack in MANET. Simulation results on MATLab exhibit the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in detecting wormhole attacks.

Decryption is successful, i.e. all wrong bit of a cryptographic check value are

decoding followed by another Soft Input Decryption. Iterative Soft Input
Decryption uses interleaved blocks. If one block can be corrected by Soft Input
Decryption, the decoding of the interleaved block is improved (serial scheme).
If Soft Input Decryption is applied on both blocks and one of the blocks can be

systems has three sources: thermodynamics, topology and symmetry.
Thermodynamics of the self-sustained vacuum allows us to treat the problems
related to the vacuum energy: the cosmological constant problems. The natural
value of the energy density of the equilibrium the self-sustained vacuum is
zero. Cosmology is discussed as the process of relaxation of vacuum towards the
equilibrium state. The present value of the cosmological constant is very small
compared to the Planck scale, because the present Universe is very old and thus
is close to equilibrium. Momentum space topology determines the universality
classes of fermionic vacua. The Standard Model vacuum both in its massless and
massive states is topological medium. The vacuum in its massless state shares
the properties of superfluid 3He-A, which is topological superfluid. It belongs
to the Fermi-point universality class, which has topologically protected
fermionic quasiparticles. At low energy they behave as relativistic massless
Weyl fermions. Gauge fields and gravity emerge together with Weyl fermions at
low energy. This allows us to treat the hierarchy problem in Standard Model:
the masses of elementary particles are very small compared to the Planck scale
because the natural value of the quark and lepton masses is zero. The small
nonzero masses appear in the infrared region, where the quantum vacuum acquires
the properties of another topological superfluid, 3He-B, and 3+1 topological
insulators. The other topological media in dimensions 2+1 and 3+1 are also
discussed. In most cases, topology is supported by discrete symmetry of the

framework mechanism designed to support heterogeneous network environments to

techniques can identify known attacks efficiently, but perform very poorly in
other cases. Anomaly detection has the potential to detect unknown attacks;
however, it is a very challenging task since its aim is to detect unknown
attacks without any priori knowledge about specific intrusions. This technology
is still at its early stage. The objective of this paper is that the system can
detect anomalous user activity. Existing research in this area focuses either
on user activity or on program operation but not on both simultaneously. In
this paper, an attempt to look at both concurrently is presented. Based on an
intrusion detection framework [1], a novel user anomaly detection system has
been implemented and conducted several intrusion detection experiments in a
simulated environment by analyzing user activity and program operation
activities. The proposed framework is a layered framework, which is designed to
satisfy the core purpose of IDS, and allows detecting the intrusion as quickly
as possible with available data using mobile agents. This framework was mainly
designed to provide security for the network using mobile agent mechanisms to
add mobility features to monitor the user processes from different
computational systems. The experimental results have shown that the system can
detect anomalous user activity effectively.

tens of nm have poor optical transmission in the visible and infrared. However,
the same films become largely transparent when the transmission is mediated by
coupled surface plasmon polaritons on the two surfaces of the film. Likewise,
it is expected that optical transmission through a hole in an opaque metal film
would be negligible if the size of the hole is much smaller than the wavelength
of the incident radiation. Contrary to this, it was found a few years ago that
opaque metal films perforated with a periodic array of sub wavelength holes
exhibit large transmission at certain wavelengths. Such extraordinary optical
properties of the metal films have attracted much attention in recent years.
They have led to several proposals and demonstrations of nanophotonic
applications in a wide range of areas, such as microscopy, spectroscopy,
optoelectronics, optical data storage, bio-chemical sensing and so on. In
parallel, extensive effort has been made to elucidate the mechanisms of
efficient light energy transfer across metal films with arrays of sub
wavelength apertures like holes and slits. Despite this effort, not all aspects
of the underlying physics of the phenomena are fully understood yet. Here, we
provide a short review of the various concepts put forth to explicate the large

of core-collapse events ever assembled, spanning a wide host-galaxy luminosity
range (down to M_r ~ -14 mag) and including a substantial fraction (>20%) of
dwarf (M_r >= -18 mag) hosts. We find more core-collapse SNe in dwarf galaxies
than expected and several interesting trends emerge. We use detailed
subclassifications of stripped-envelope core-collapse SNe and find that all
Type I core-collapse events occurring in dwarf galaxies are either SNe Ib or
broad-lined SNe Ic (SNe Ic-BL), while ""normal"" SNe Ic dominate in giant
galaxies. We also see a significant excess of SNe IIb in dwarf hosts. We
hypothesize that in lower metallicity hosts, metallicity-driven mass loss is
reduced, allowing massive stars that would have appeared as ""normal"" SNe Ic in
metal-rich galaxies to retain some He and H, exploding as Ib/IIb events. At the
same time, another mechanism allows some stars to undergo extensive stripping
and explode as SNe Ic-BL (and presumably also as long-duration gamma-ray
bursts). Our results are still limited by small-number statistics, and our
measurements of the observed N(Ib/c)/N(II) number ratio in dwarf and giant
hosts (0.25_{-0.15}^{+0.3} and 0.23_{-0.08}^{+0.11}, respectively; 1 sigma

predictions. As additional PTF data accumulate, more robust statistical

compared the abundances provided by the direct method with those obtained using
empirical calibrations, finding that (i) the Pilyugin method is the best
suitable empirical calibration, (ii) the relations between the oxygen abundance

that in some ranges of rf frequency and magnetic field this can be done without
giving rise to losses. We also show that halo molecules of large spatial extent
require much less rf power than deeply bound states. Another way to exert
resonant control is with a set of rf-coupled bound states, linked to the
colliding pair through the molecular interactions that give rise to
magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances. This was recently demonstrated for

consider the control that may be exerted over atomic collisions by placing

relaxation at high temperature. We also find a significant increase of the spin
relaxation time for high spin polarization even at room temperature, which is
due to the Coulomb Hartree-Fock contribution-induced effective longitudinal
magnetic field. It is also discovered that the spin relaxation time increases
with the in-plane electric field due to the hot-electron effect, which is

distributed variables. The outlines of the theory have been described in a
previous Letter, the main result being that finite-size shape corrections to
the limit distribution can be obtained from a linearization of the RG
transformation near a fixed point, leading to the computation of stable
perturbations as eigenfunctions. Here we show details of the RG theory which
exhibit remarkable similarities to the RG known in statistical physics. Besides
the fixed points explaining universality, and the least stable eigendirections
accounting for convergence rates and shape corrections, the similarities
include marginally stable perturbations which turn out to be generic for the
Fisher-Tippett-Gumbel class. Distribution functions containing unstable
perturbations are also considered. We find that, after a transitory divergence,
they return to the universal fixed line at the same or at a different point
depending on the type of perturbation.

protostar NGC 7538S, which is in the center of a cold dense cloud core with a
radius of 0.5 pc and a mass of ~2,000 Msun. These observations show that NGC
7538S is embedded in a compact elliptical core with a mass of 85 - 115 Msun.
The star is surrounded by a rotating accretion disk, which powers a very young,
hot molecular outflow approximately perpendicular to the rotating accretion
disk. The accretion rate is very high, ~ 1.4 - 2.8 10^-3 Msun yr^-1. Evidence
for rotation of the disk surrounding the star is seen in all largely optically
thin molecular tracers, H13CN J = 1-0, HN13C J = 1-0, H13CO+ J = 1-0, and DCN J
= 3-2. Many molecules appear to be affected by the hot molecular outflow,
including DCN and H13CO+. The emission from CH3CN, which has often been used to
trace disk rotation in young high-mass stars, is dominated by the outflow,
especially at higher K-levels. Our new high-angular resolution observations
show that the rotationally supported part of the disk is smaller than we
previously estimated. The enclosed mass of the inner, rotationally supported
part of the disk (D ~ 5"", i.e 14,000 AU) is ~ 14 - 24 Msun.

to the EKB. In this study we aim to determine how many IRAS 25um excesses
towards A stars are real, and investigate where the dust lies. We observe with
TIMMI2, VISIR, Michelle and TReCS a sample of A and B-type main sequence stars
reported as having mid-IR excess. We constrain the location of the debris
through combined modelling of the emission spectrum and a modelling technique
designed to constrain the radial extent of emission in mid-IR imaging. We
independently confirm the presence of warm dust around 3 of the candidates:
HD3003, HD80950 and eta Tel. For the binary HD3003 a stability analysis
indicates the dust is either circumstellar and lying at ~4 AU with the binary
orbiting at >14AU, or the dust lies in an unstable location; there is some
evidence for temporal evolution of its excess emission on a ~20 year timescale.
For 7 of the targets we present quantitative limits on the location of dust
around the star. We demonstrate that the disc around HD71155 must have
spatially distinct components at 2 and 60AU. We model the limits of current
instrumentation and show that most of the known A star debris discs which could
be readily resolved at 18um on 8m instruments have been resolved. Limits from
unresolved imaging can help distinguish between competing models of the disc
emission, but resolved imaging is key to the determination of the disc
location. Modelling of the detection limits for extended emission can be useful
for targeting future observational campaigns. MIRI on the JWST will be able to
resolve most of the known A star debris disc population. METIS on the E-ELT
will provide the opportunity to explore the hot disc population more thoroughly
by detecting extended emission where calibration accuracy limits disc detection
through photometry, reaching levels below 1 zodi for stars at <10pc.

interpreted as constituents of dark matter. In one such class of models, dark
matter is made up of both a Majorana dark matter particle, i.e., a neutralino,
and a Dirac fermion with the current relic density of dark matter as given by
WMAP being composed of the relic density of the two species. These models can
explain the PAMELA positron data and are consistent with the anti-proton flux
data, as well as the photon data from FERMI-LAT. Further, it is shown that such

can be probed in CDMS-II, XENON-100 and other ongoing dark matter experiments.

$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty (\var_n \log g)^2<\infty,$$ (2) For any fixed $\epsilon>0$,

Bernoullicity) [2], allowing the variations of log g to be essentially twice as

uniqueness and for the Bernoulli property. We also conclude that we have
convergence in the Wasserstein metric of the iterates of the adjoint transfer
operator to the g-measure.
