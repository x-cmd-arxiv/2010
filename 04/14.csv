between selected tasks, cognitive abilities and search result interfaces. The
underlying objective is to understand how to select search results presentation
for tasks and user contexts. Twenty three participants conducted four search
tasks of two types and used two interfaces (List and Overview) to refine and
examine search results. Clickthrough data were recorded. This controlled study
employed a mixed model design with two within-subject factors (task and
interface) and two between-subject factors (two cognitive abilities: memory
span and verbal closure). Quantitative analyses were carried out by means of
the statistical package SPSS. Specifically, multivariate analysis of variance
with repeated measures and non-parametric tests were performed on the collected
data. The overview of search results appeared to have benefited searchers in
several ways. It made them faster; it facilitated formulation of more effective
queries and helped to assess search results. Searchers with higher cognitive
abilities were faster in the Overview interface and in less demanding
situations (on simple tasks), while at the same time they issued about the same
number of queries as lower-ability searchers. In more demanding situations (on
complex tasks and in the List interface), the higher ability searchers expended
more search effort, although they were not significantly slower than the lower
ability people in these situations. The higher search effort, however, did not
result in a measurable improvement of task outcomes for high-ability searchers.
These findings have implications for the design of search interfaces. They
suggest benefits of providing result overviews. They also suggest the
importance of considering cognitive abilities in the design of search results'
presentation and interaction.

the internal coil, more strongly coiled rods display cholesteric order with
opposite handedness. The correlation between the symmetry of the microscopic

Mixing helices with sufficiently disparate lengths and coil pitches gives rise

Electron Microscopy (TEM),magnetization M, and ac magnetic susceptibility
measurements. The OA coated samples were produced with different magnetic
concentrations (78, 76, and 65%) and the DA sample with 63% of Fe3O4. Images
from TEM indicate that the NP have a nearly spherical geometry and mean
diameter ~ 5.5 nm. Magnetization measurements, performed in zero field cooled
(ZFC) and field cooled (FC) processes under different external magnetic fields
H, exhibited a maximum at a given temperature TB in the ZFC curves, which
depends on the NP coating (OA or DA), magnetite concentration, and H. The
temperature TB decreases monotonically with increasing H and, for a given H,
the increase in the magnetite concentration results in an increase of TB. The
observed behavior is related to the dipolar interaction (DI) between NP which
seems to be an important mechanism in all samples studied. This is supported by
the results of the ac magnetic susceptibility Xac measurements, where the
temperature in which X' peaks for different frequencies follows the
Vogel-Fulcher model, a feature commonly found in systems with dipolar
interactions. Curves of H vs. TB/TB(H=0) for samples with different coatings
and magnetite concentrations collapse into a universal curve, indicating that
the qualitative magnetic behavior of the samples may be described by the NP
themselves, instead of the coating or the strength of the dipolar interaction.
Below TB, M vs. H curves show a coercive field (HC) that increases
monotonically with decreasing temperature. The saturation magnetization (MS)
follows the Bloch's law and values of MS at room temperature as high as 78
emu/g were estimated, a result corresponding to ~80% of the bulk value. The
overlap of M/MS vs. H/T curves for a given sample and the low HC at high
temperatures suggest superparamagnetic behavior in all samples studied. The
overlap of M/MS vs. H curves at constant temperature for different samples
indicates that the NP magnetization behavior is preserved, independently of the
coating and magnetite concentration.

all other known superconductors, including cuprates, may be different in

measuring the electronic specific heat in a rotating magnetic field, as a

amorphous bodies in general. This is mainly due to the interplay between
phenomena at different levels and length-scales. In particular, it is not
necessarily true that the microscopic level (dominated by direct interactions)
coincides with the level where the continuum description comes into play. This
is typically the case in the presence of structural inhomogeneities which are
inherent to all structurally disordered states of matter below close packing.
As a consequence, the macroscopic response to external fields of either fluid
or arrested disordered states is not well understood. In order to disentangle
this complexity, in this work we build upon a simple yet seemingly powerful
concept. This can be summarized as follows: the mesoscopic length-scale of
structural inhomogeneities is assumed to be the characteristic length-scale of
the effective building blocks, while the degrees of freedom of the primary
particles are integrated out. Theoretical results are derived, in the present
work, for the macroscopic response of fluid and dynamically arrested model
colloidal states in fields of shear. The predictions of the coarse-grained
theories and the applicability of the principle are tested in comparison with

measure a strong excess of clustering at ~ 110 Mpc/h, as previously reported in
the literature. We also test these results in an alternative coordinate system,

the better-measured monopole. A fiducial {\Lambda}CDM non-linear model in

measurements can be explained well by our mocks as well as by a featureless

clustering measurement is the line-of-sight baryonic acoustic feature. We also
evaluate how detectable such a signal would be in the upcoming Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey LRG volume (BOSS). Mock LRG catalogs (z < 0.6)
suggest that: (i) the narrow line- of-sight cylinder and cone defined above
probably will not reveal a detectable acoustic feature in BOSS; (ii) a
clustering measurement as high as that in the current sample can be ruled out

explains anomalous dynamical properties, like that of stars in galaxies[4,5,6]
. Alternatively the anomalies have been explained by adjusting and modifying
well known laws (""Modified Newtonian dynamics""[7]). Here we show that
millimeter black holes (m.b.h.) explain both: the background radiation, by its
partial ""evaporation"", and the dark matter. Black holes emit blackbody
radiation (Hawking[8] evaporation), and this is what is observed in the CMBR.
Millimeter size black holes emit blackbody radiation at a temperature of
2.7{\deg} Kelvin, and this is the resulting CMBR . Partial evaporation of
~10^30 m.b.h. gives the observed background field of photons being emitted and
absorbed at the same rate by the m.b.h. The number of photons is constant, as
observed. Their temperature decreases with time because the mass of the m.b.h.
(and therefore its size) increases with time (the mass-boom effect[9]). The
total mass of the m.b.h. is the dark matter. Hence dark matter is not so ""dark""

to a volume-limited sample constructed from SDSS DR5. We populate a rich
parameter space by obtaining independent measurements of density on different
scales for each galaxy, avoiding the implicit assumptions involved, e.g., in
the construction of group catalogues. As the first application of this method,
we study how the bimodality in galaxy colour distribution (u-r) depends on
multiscale density. The u-r galaxy colour distribution is described as the sum
of two gaussians (red and blue) with five parameters: the fraction of red
galaxies (f_r) and the position and width of the red and blue peaks (mu_r,
mu_b, sigma_r and sigma_b). Galaxies mostly react to their smallest scale (<
0.5 Mpc) environments: in denser environments red galaxies are more common
(larger f_r), redder (larger mu_r) and with a narrower distribution (smaller
sigma_r), while blue galaxies are redder (larger mu_b) but with a broader
distribution (larger sigma_b). There are residual correlations of f_r and mu_b
with 0.5 - 1 Mpc scale density, which imply that total or partial truncation of
star formation can relate to a galaxy's environment on these scales. Beyond 1
Mpc (0.5 Mpc for mu_r) there are no positive correlations with density. However
f_r (mu_r) anti-correlates with density on >2 (1) Mpc scales at fixed density
on smaller scales. We examine these trends qualitatively in the context of the
halo model, utilizing the properties of haloes within which the galaxies are
embedded, derived by Yang et al, 2007 and applied to a group catalogue. This
yields an excellent description of the trends with multiscale density,
including the anti-correlations on large scales, which map the region of
accretion onto massive haloes. Thus we conclude that galaxies become red only
once they have been accreted onto haloes of a certain mass.

have a higher binary fraction than PD high-concentration clusters.

evolution of the pre-MW gas cloud on short time-scales (a few hundred Myr) via
cluster metallicities. The results are shown to be consistent with a
contracting and self-gravitating cloud in which fluctuations in the pre-MW

are bimodally distributed according to central gas entropy and are separated
into two distinct classes: cool core (CC) and non-cool core (NCC) clusters.
While it is widely accepted that AGN feedback plays a key role in offsetting
radiative losses and maintaining many clusters in the CC state, the origin of
NCC clusters is much less clear. At the same time, a handful of extremely
powerful AGN outbursts have recently been detected in clusters, with a total
energy ~10^{61}-10^{62} erg. Using two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we
show that if a large fraction of this energy is deposited near the centers of
CC clusters, which is likely common due to dense cores, these AGN outbursts can
completely remove CCs, transforming them to NCC clusters. Our model also has
interesting implications for cluster abundance profiles, which usually show a
central peak in CC systems. Our calculations indicate that during the CC to NCC
transformation, AGN outbursts efficiently mix metals in cluster central
regions, and may even remove central abundance peaks if they are not broad
enough. For CC clusters with broad central abundance peaks, AGN outbursts
decrease peak abundances, but can not effectively destroy the peaks. Our model
may simultaneously explain the contradictory (possibly bimodal) results of
abundance profiles in NCC clusters, some of which are nearly flat, while others
have strong central peaks similar to those in CC clusters. A statistical
analysis of the sizes of central abundance peaks and their redshift evolution
may shed interesting insights on the origin of both types of NCC clusters and
the evolution history of thermodynamics and AGN activity in clusters.

arise if the axial coupling of the nucleon to pions is large, g_A \sim Nc.
While g_A \sim Nc in non-relativistic quark and Skyrme models, it has been
suggested that Skyrmions may collapse to a small size, r \sim 1/f_pi \sim
Lambda_QCD^{-1}/sqrt(Nc). (This is also the typical scale over which the string
vertex moves in a string vertex model of the baryon.) We concentrate on the
case of two flavors, where we suggest that to construct a nucleon with a small
axial coupling, that most quarks are bound into colored diquark pairs, which
have zero spin and isospin. For odd Nc, this leaves one unpaired quark, which
carries the spin and isospin of the nucleon. If the unpaired quark is in a
spatial wavefunction orthogonal to the wavefunctions of the scalar diquarks,
then up to logarithms of Nc, the unpaired quark only costs an energy \sim
Lambda_QCD. This naturally gives g_A \sim 1 and has other attractive features.
In nature, the wavefunctions of the paired and unpaired quarks might only be
approximately orthogonal; then g_A depends weakly upon Nc. This dichotomy in
wave functions could arise if the unpaired quark orbits at a size which is
parametrically large in comparison to that of the diquarks. We discuss possible
tests of these ideas from numerical simulations on the lattice, for two flavors
and three and five colors; the extension of our ideas to more than three or
more flavors is not obvious, though.

At z = 0.0593, this is the third-nearest GRB-SN. Nightly optical spectra
obtained with the Magellan telescopes during the first week after explosion
reveal the gradual emergence of very broad spectral features superposed on a
blue continuum. The supernova features are typical of broad-lined SNe Ic and
are generally consistent with previous supernovae associated with low-redshift
GRBs. However, the inferred velocities of SN 2010bh at 21 days after explosion
are a factor of ~2 times larger than those of the prototypical SN 1998bw at
similar epochs, with v ~ 26,000 km/s, indicating a larger explosion energy or a
different ejecta structure. A near-infrared spectrum taken 13.8 days after
explosion shows no strong evidence for He I at 1.083 microns, implying that the
progenitor was largely stripped of its helium envelope. The host galaxy is of
low luminosity (M_R ~ -18.5 mag) and low metallicity (Z < 0.4 Z_solar), similar
to the hosts of other low-redshift GRB-SNe.

few ""extended green objects"" (EGOs) normally taken as signposts of outflow
activity, and none of the HH jets detected optically are seen as EGOs. A
population of ""extended red objects"" tends to be found around OB stars, some
with clear bow-shocks. These are dusty shocks where stellar winds collide with
flows off nearby clouds. Finally, the relative distributions of O stars and
subclusters of YSOs as compared to dust pillars shows that while some YSOs are
located within pillars, many more stars and YSOs reside just outside pillar
heads. We suggest that pillars are transient phenomena, part of a continuous
outwardly propagating wave of star formation driven by massive star feedback.
As pillars are destroyed, they leave newly formed stars in their wake, which
are then subsumed into the young OB association. Altogether, the current
generation of YSOs shows no strong deviation from a normal IMF. The number of
YSOs suggests a roughly constant star-formation rate over the past 3Myr,
implying that star formation in pillars constitutes an important mechanism to
construct unbound OB associations. Accelerated pillars may give birth to O-type
stars that, after several Myr, could appear to have formed in isolation.

For a class of quasi-stationary states which result from the violent relaxation

approximately linearly in the particle number N, and (ii) shows also a strong
dependence on R_0, with quasi-stationary states from colder initial conditions
relaxing much more rapidly. The temporal evolution of the order parameter may
be well described by a stretched exponential function. We study finally the
correlation of the relaxation times with the amplitude of fluctuations in the
relaxing quasi-stationary states, as well as the relation between temporal and

The results are extended to a special class of second-order processes, relevant

Data on 10,409 naturalizations of 5350 plant species over 16 sites dispersed
globally show exponential distributions for both species over sites and sites
over number of species shared. These exponentials signal a statistical
mechanics of species distribution, assuming two conditions. First, species and
sites are equivalent, either identical ('neutral'), or so complex that the
chance a species is in the right place at the right time is vanishingly small
('idiosyncratic'); the range of species and sites in our data disallows a
neutral explanation. Secondly, the total number of naturalisations is fixed in
any era by a 'regulator'. Previous correlation of species naturalization rates
with net primary productivity over time suggests that regulator is related to
productivity. We conclude that biotic resistance is a moving ceiling, with
resistance controlled by productivity. The general observation that the
majority of species occur naturally at only a few sites but only a few at many
now has a quantitative [exponential] character, offering the study of species'
distributions a previously unavailable rigor.

Numerical simulations under a certain feed rate and screw revolution speed were
performed, and the mixing process was investigated using Lagrangian statistics.
It was found that the four types had different mixing characteristics, and
their mixing processes were explained by the coupling effect of drag flow with
the disk staggering and pitched-tip and pressure flows, which are controlled by
operational conditions. The use of a pitched-tip effectively to controls the
balance of the pressurization and mixing ability.

the gravitational self-force in a modified radiation gauge for a particle
moving on a geodesic in a Schwarzschild or Kerr spacetime. An extension of an
earlier result by Wald is used to show the spin-weight $\pm 2$ perturbed Weyl
scalar ($\psi_0$ or $\psi_4$) determines the metric perturbation outside the
particle up to a gauge transformation and an infinitesimal change in mass and
angular momentum. A Hertz potential is used to construct the part of the
retarded metric perturbation that involves no change in mass or angular
momentum from $\psi_0$ in a radiation gauge. The metric perturbation is
completed by adding changes in the mass and angular momentum of the background
spacetime outside the radial coordinate $r_0$ of the particle in any convenient
gauge. The resulting metric perturbation is singular on the trajectory of the
particle and discontinuous across the sphere $r=r_0$. A mode-sum method can be
used to renormalize the self-force, but the justification given in the
published version of this paper \cite{sf2} referred to work by Sam Gralla
\cite{gralla10} to justify the use of the renormalized self-force, and the
radiation gauge we use does not satisfy the regularity conditions required by
Gralla. Instead we show that the renormalized self-force, computed either from
the retarded field for $r>r_0$ or for $r<r_0$ gives the correct equations of
motion in a gauge smoothly related to a Lorenz gauge; and Pound et al.
\cite{pmb13} argue that the average of the self-force obtained in the way
described in our paper for $r>r_0$ and for $r<r_0$ gives the correct equation
of motion for our gauge (what Pound et al. call the no-string gauge).

network efficiency (low power dissipation within the transmission network) and
the cost to build the network. We begin with a convex optimization method based
on the paper ``Minimizing Effective Resistance of a Graph'' [Ghosh, Boyd \&
Saberi]. We show that this (DC) resistive network method can be adapted to the
context of AC power flow. However, that does not address the combinatorial
aspect of selecting network structure. We approach this problem as selecting a
subgraph within an over-complete network, posed as minimizing the (convex)
network power dissipation plus a non-convex cost on line conductances that
encourages sparse networks where many line conductances are set to zero. We
develop a heuristic approach to solve this non-convex optimization problem
using: (1) a continuation method to interpolate from the smooth, convex problem
to the (non-smooth, non-convex) combinatorial problem, (2) the
majorization-minimization algorithm to perform the necessary intermediate
smooth but non-convex optimization steps. Ultimately, this involves solving a
sequence of convex optimization problems in which we iteratively reweight a
linear cost on line conductances to fit the actual non-convex cost. Several
examples are presented which suggest that the overall method is a good
heuristic for network design. We also consider how to obtain sparse networks

understand the sufficient conditions for the pre-quantization of $M_G(\Sigma)$,
the moduli space of flat $G$-bundles over a closed surface $\Sigma$. For a
simply connected, compact, simple Lie group $G$, $M_G(\Sigma)$ is known to be
pre-quantizable at integer levels. For non-simply connected $G$, however,
integrality of the level is not sufficient for pre-quantization, and this
thesis determines the obstruction---namely a certain cohomology class in
$H^3(G\times G;\Z)$---that places further restrictions on the underlying level.
The levels that admit a pre-quantization of the moduli space are determined
explicitly for all non-simply connected, compact, simple Lie groups $G$.
Partial results are obtained for the case of a surface $\Sigma$ with marked

3D MHD simulations to investigate the interaction between magnetic field and
turbulent convection. In the simulations, a weak vertical uniform magnetic
field is imposed in a region of fully developed granular convection; and the
total magnetic flux through the top and bottom boundaries is kept constant. The
simulation results reveal a process of spontaneous formation of stable magnetic
structures, which may be a key to understanding of the magnetic
self-organization on the Sun and formation of pores and sunspots. This process
consists of two basic steps: 1) formation of small-scale filamentary magnetic
structures associated with concentrations of vorticity and whirlpool-type
motions, and 2) merging of these structures due to the vortex attraction,
caused by converging downdrafts around magnetic concentration below the
surface. In the resulting large-scale structure maintained by the converging
plasma motions, the magnetic field strength reaches ~1.5 kG at the surface and
~6 kG in the interior; and the surface structure resembles solar pores. The
magnetic structure remains stable for the whole simulation run of several hours

currently observed distribution of short GRBs relative to their host galaxies,
we obtain the fraction of the component that traces the mergers of binary
compact objects and the one that traces star formation rate (such as massive
stars) in early- and late-type host galaxies. We find that the fraction of
massive star component is 0.37\pm 0.13 from the analysis of projected offset
distribution. This suggests that a good fraction of short GRBs still originate
from merger events. From our analysis, we also conclude that the fraction of
late-type hosts among the elliptical, starburst and spiral galaxy is 0.82\pm
0.05, which is consistent with the observed early- to late-type number ratio of
host galaxies.

consisting of few to many resources with features including self-configuration,
scalability, and resilience to node failures. Such systems have been
successfully adopted in large-scale services for content delivery networks,
file sharing, and data storage. In small-scale systems, they can be useful to
address privacy concerns and for network applications that lack dedicated
servers. The bootstrap problem, finding an existing peer in the overlay,
remains a challenge to enabling these services for small-scale P2P systems. In
large networks, the solution to the bootstrap problem has been the use of
dedicated services, though creating and maintaining these systems requires
expertise and resources, which constrain their usefulness and make them
unappealing for small-scale systems. This paper surveys and summarizes
requirements that allow peers potentially constrained by network connectivity
to bootstrap small-scale overlays through the use of existing public overlays.
In order to support bootstrapping, a public overlay must support the following
requirements: a method for reflection in order to obtain publicly reachable
addresses, so peers behind network address translators and firewalls can
receive incoming connection requests; communication relaying to share public
addresses and communicate when direct communication is not feasible; and
rendezvous for discovering remote peers, when the overlay lacks stable
membership. After presenting a survey of various public overlays, we identify
two overlays that match the requirements: XMPP overlays, such as Google Talk
and Live Journal Talk, and Brunet, a structured overlay based upon Symphony. We
present qualitative experiences with prototypes that demonstrate the ability to
bootstrap small-scale private structured overlays from public Brunet or XMPP
infrastructures.

asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since
many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior
of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established
the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information
criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the
average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically
compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information
criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is
asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a
random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization
using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the
Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is
asymptotically equal to $2\lambda/n$, where $\lambda$ is the real log canonical
threshold and $n$ is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation
between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined
by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify
that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes
cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.

family of mutually commuting operators, responsible for the l-weight
decomposition of finite dimensional modules. The natural Jordan filtration
induced by these operators is generically non-trivial on l-weight spaces of
dimension greater than one. We derive, for every standard module of quantum
affine sl2, the dimensions of the Jordan grades and prove that they can be
directly read off from the t-dependence of the q,t-characters introduced by
Nakajima. To do so we construct explicit bases for the standard modules with
respect to which the Cartan generators are upper-triangular. The basis vectors
of each l-weight space are labelled by the elements of a ranked poset from the
family L(m,n).

reliability is commonly required. A dynamical jumping real-time fault-tolerant
routing protocol (DMRF) is proposed in this paper. Each node utilizes the
remaining transmission time of the data packets and the state of the forwarding
candidate node set to dynamically choose the next hop. Once node failure,
network congestion or void region occurs, the transmission mode will switch to
jumping transmission mode, which can reduce the transmission time delay,
guaranteeing the data packets to be sent to the destination node within the
specified time limit. By using feedback mechanism, each node dynamically
adjusts the jumping probabilities to increase the ratio of successful
transmission. Simulation results show that DMRF can not only efficiently reduce
the effects of failure nodes, congestion and void region, but also yield higher
ratio of successful transmission, smaller transmission delay and reduced number
of control packets.

and molecular gas in disk galaxies. Simple recipes for processes such as
cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and chemical enrichment of the
stars and gas are grafted on to dark matter halo merger trees derived from the
Millennium Simulation. Each galactic disk is represented by a series of
concentric rings. We assume that surface density profile of infalling gas in a
dark matter halo is exponential, with scale radius r_d that is proportional to
the virial radius of the halo times its spin parameter $\lambda$. As the dark
matter haloes grow through mergers and accretion, disk galaxies assemble from
the inside out. We include two simple prescriptions for molecular gas formation
processes in our models: one is based on the analytic calculations by Krumholz,
McKee & Tumlinson (2008), and the other is a prescription where the H_2
fraction is determined by the kinematic pressure of the ISM. Motivated by the
observational results of Leroy et al. (2008), we adopt a star formation law in
which $\Sigma_{SFR}\propto\Sigma_{H_2}$ in the regime where the molecular gas
dominates the total gas surface density, and $\Sigma_{SFR}\propto
\Sigma_{gas}^2$ where atomic hydrogen dominates. We then fit these models to
the radial surface density profiles of stars, HI and H_2 drawn from recent high
resolution surveys of stars and gas in nearby galaxies. We explore how the
ratios of atomic gas, molecular gas and stellar mass vary as a function of
global galaxy scale parameters, including stellar mass, stellar surface
density, and gas surface density. We elucidate how the trends can be understood
in terms of three variables that determine the partition of baryons in disks:
the mass of the dark matter halo, the spin parameter of the halo, and the
amount of gas recently accreted from the external environment.

upwelling potential due to its location near the equator, and the forcing time
of the typhoon (>82 h) was much longer than the geostrophic adjustment time

the depth of the mixed-layer, which consequently induced a strong phytoplankton

XMM time. We observe a global decline of temperature across the relic from 6 to
1 keV, similar to the Suzaku results. Our new observations reveal a sharp
change of both temperature and surface brightness near the position of the
relic. The increased X-ray emission on the relic can be equivalently well
described by either a thermal or nonthermal spectral model. The parameters of
the thermal model are consistent with a Mach number M~2 shock and a shock speed
of ~1200 km s^-1. The energy content of the relativistic particles in the radio

placed on the circumference of the circle centered at their parent, and the
radius of the circle centered at each node along any path from the root
reflects the number of descendants associated with the node. Among various
styles of tree drawings reported in the literature, the balloon drawing enjoys
a desirable feature of displaying tree structures in a rather balanced fashion.
For each internal node in a balloon drawing, the ray from the node to each of
its children divides the wedge accommodating the subtree rooted at the child
into two sub-wedges. Depending on whether the two sub-wedge angles are required
to be identical or not, a balloon drawing can further be divided into two
types: even sub-wedge and uneven sub-wedge types. In the most general case, for
any internal node in the tree there are two dimensions of freedom that affect
the quality of a balloon drawing: (1) altering the order in which the children
of the node appear in the drawing, and (2) for the subtree rooted at each child
of the node, flipping the two sub-wedges of the subtree. In this paper, we give
a comprehensive complexity analysis for optimizing balloon drawings of rooted
trees with respect to angular resolution, aspect ratio and standard deviation
of angles under various drawing cases depending on whether the tree is of even

out that some are NP-complete while others can be solved in polynomial time. We

critical coupling $\kappa_{c_{1}} = 0.66 \pm 0.02$. At the transition the
energy and its first derivative seem continuous, thus providing a typical
scenario of a second-order transition, although a weakly first-order transition
cannot be excluded. By contrast, the average on-site magnetization $M$
approaches a nonzero value $M_{c_{1}}=0.195 \pm 0.005$ on both sides of the
transition, which is more typical of a first-order transition. The slope
$dM/d\kappa$ also appears to be continuous, or very nearly so, at the critical
point $\kappa_{c_{1}}$. We find strong evidence that the canted phase becomes
unstable at large values of $\kappa$, and hence we have also used the CCM with
a model collinear semi-stripe-ordered ferrimagnetic state in which alternating
rows (and columns) are ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically ordered. We
find tentative evidence, based on the relative energies of the two states, for
a second (first-order) phase transition between the canted and
semi-stripe-ordered states at a large value of the coupling parameter around
$\kappa_{c_{2}} \approx 125 \pm 5$. This prediction, however, is based on an
extrapolation of the CCM results for the canted state into regimes where the
CCM equations at any level of approximation beyond the lowest have no
solutions.

symmetric spacetimes with weak regularity when the matter consists of an
irrotational perfect fluid with pressure equal to its mass-energy density. Our
theory encompasses the class of weakly regular spacetimes whose metric
coefficients have square-integrable first-order derivatives and whose curvature
must be understood in the sense of distributions. We formulate the
characteristic initial value problem with data posed on two null hypersurfaces
intersecting along a two-plane. Relying on Newman-Penrose's formalism and
expressing our weak regularity conditions in terms of the Newman-Penrose
scalars, we arrive at a fully geometrical formulation in which, along each
initial hypersurface, two scalar fields describing the incoming radiation must
be prescribed. To analyze the future boundary of such a spacetime and identify
its global causal structure, we introduce a gauge that reduces the Einstein
equations to a coupled system of wave equations and ordinary differential
equations for well-chosen unknowns. We prove that, within the weak regularity
class under consideration and for generic initial data, a true spacetime
singularity forms in finite proper time. Our formulation is robust enough so
that propagating discontinuities in the curvature or in the matter variables do
not prevent us from constructing a spacetime whose curvature generically
blows-up on the future boundary. Earlier work on the problem studied here was
restricted to sufficiently regular and vacuum spacetimes.

with Fe I up to Fe X; we detect no shifts to higher ionization states nor any

mAngstroms, which means that the reprocessing material is not rotating at high
speeds. c) Fe Kalpha fluorescence is present in all the HMXB in the survey
while such emissions are very rare (~ 10% ) among LMXBs. d) The lack of Fe line
emission is always accompanied by the lack of any detectable K edge. e) We
obtain the empirical curve of growth of the equivalent width of the Fe Kalpha

spherically symmetric BPS black hole solutions in the STU model the well-known
process of moduli stabilization at the horizon can be recast in a form of a
distillation procedure of a three-qubit entangled state of GHZ-type. By
studying the full flow in moduli space in this paper we investigate this
distillation procedure in more detail. We introduce a three-qubit state with
amplitudes depending on the conserved charges the warp factor, and the moduli.
We show that for the recently discovered non-BPS solutions it is possible to
see how the distillation procedure unfolds itself as we approach the horizon.
For the non-BPS seed solutions at the asymptotically Minkowski region we are
starting with a three-qubit state having seven nonequal nonvanishing amplitudes
and finally at the horizon we get a GHZ state with merely four nonvanishing
ones with equal magnitudes. The magnitude of the surviving nonvanishing
amplitudes is proportional to the macroscopic black hole entropy. A systematic
study of such attractor states shows that their properties reflect the
structure of the fake superpotential. We also demonstrate that when starting
with the very special values for the moduli corresponding to flat directions
the uniform structure at the horizon deteriorates due to errors generalizing
the usual bit flips acting on the qubits of the attractor states.

variability characteristics we observe were unexpected, and need to be
understood. We briefly discuss a few alternatives for producing the observed
variations in light of the fact that the viscous timescale of the disk is of
order a week, comparable to the shorter time scale variation that is observed

energies, with a flux about seven times higher than the one implied by the
upper limit from previous EGRET observations. With the accumulation of one-year
of Fermi-LAT all-sky-survey exposure, we now detect flux and spectral
variations of this source on month timescales, as reported in this paper. The
average >100 MeV gamma-ray spectrum of NGC1275 shows a possible deviation from

forecasts are often more than one step removed from reality. The reason behind
this is that CAM routines do not take either the dynamic performances of the

article seeks to improve simulation of high-speed NC machine dynamic behaviour

through enhanced simulation of three-axis paths in linear and circular

The second model allows transition passages between blocks to be integrated in

reconstructed when k or more participants printing theirs shares on
transparencies and stack them together. No secret is revealed with fewer than k
shares. The alignment of the transparencies is important to the visual quality
of the reconstructed secret image. In VSS scheme, each pixel of the original
secret image is expanded to m sub-pixels in a share image. If a share image is
printed on paper with the same size as the original secret image, the alignment
or the registration of the sub-pixels, which is only m times smaller than that
in the original secret, could be troublesome. Liu et al. [4] has noticed this
alignment problem and observed that some information of the secret image may
still be revealed even when the shares are not precisely registered in the
horizontal direction. Yang et al. [9] introduced a general approach to
construct a misalignment tolerant (k, n)-VSS scheme using big and small blocks
for the situation where the original secret image has a certain degree of
redundancy in shape accuracy. In this paper, we propose a (2, n)-VSS scheme
that allows a relative shift between the shares in the horizontal direction and
vertical direction. When the shares are perfectly aligned, the contrast of the
reconstructed image is equal to that of traditional VSS shceme. When there is a
shift, average contrast in the reconstructed image is higher than that of the
traditional VSS scheme, and the scheme can still work in the cases where very
little shape redundancy presents in the image. The trade-off is that our method
involves a larger pixel expansion. The basic building block of our scheme is
duplication and concatenation of certain rows or columns of the basic matrices.
This seemingly simple but very powerful construction principle can be easily
used to create more general (k, n)-VSS schemes.

is described as a stochastic process on a lattice. This admittedly crude
approximation still catches essential physics of polymer motion, i.e. the
universal properties as function of polymer length. More than the static
properties, the dynamics depends on the rules of motion. Small changes in the
hopping probabilities can result in different universal behavior. In particular
the cross-over between Rouse dynamics and reptation is controlled by the types
and strength of the hoppings that are allowed. The properties are analyzed
using a calculational scheme based on an analogy with one-dimensional spin
systems. It leads to accurate data for intermediately long polymers. These are
extrapolated to arbitrarily long polymers, by means of finite-size-scaling
analysis. Exponents and cross-over functions for the renewal time and the
diffusion coefficient are discussed for various types of motion.

is no algorithm capable of learning the complete class of deterministic regular
expressions from positive examples only, as we will show. The regular
expressions occurring in practical DTDs and XSDs, however, are such that every
alphabet symbol occurs only a small number of times. As such, in practice it
suffices to learn the subclass of deterministic regular expressions in which
each alphabet symbol occurs at most k times, for some small k. We refer to such
expressions as k-occurrence regular expressions (k-OREs for short). Motivated
by this observation, we provide a probabilistic algorithm that learns k-OREs
for increasing values of k, and selects the deterministic one that best
describes the sample based on a Minimum Description Length argument. The
effectiveness of the method is empirically validated both on real world and
synthetic data. Furthermore, the method is shown to be conservative over the
simpler classes of expressions considered in previous work.

at low enough temperatures the system exhibits a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid
behavior corresponding to an effective spin-3/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg
chain with short-range exchange interactions. On the other hand, at somewhat
elevated temperatures the composite spin structure of the chain is revealed
through a Schottky-type peak in the specific heat located around 2 K. We argue
that the dominating contribution to the peak originates from gapped magnon-type

histories. In selecting galaxies from the Millennium Simulation for this study,
we show that using rest-frame criteria significantly improves the homogeneity
of the sample and that H(z) can be recovered to within 3% at z~0.42 even when
extended star formation histories are considered. We demonstrate explicitly
that using Single Stellar Populations to age-date galaxies from the
semi-analytical simulations provides insufficient accuracy for this experiment
but accurate ages are obtainable if the complex star formation histories
extracted from the simulation are used. We note, however, that problems with
SSP-fitting might be overestimated since the semi-analytical models tend to
over predict the late-time star-formation in LRGs. Finally, we optimize an
observational program to carry out this experiment.

possible linear-optical implementations of the iSWAP gate: (i) assuming various
ancilla states (unentangled, two-photon and multiphoton-entangled states) or no
ancillae at all, (ii) with or without classical feedforward, (iii) destructive

reveal temporal information about dynamical heterogeneity in glass-forming

higher-order response function analyzed in multidimensional nonlinear
spectroscopy. Here, we provide comprehensive numerical results of the
four-point, three-time density correlation function from longtime trajectories
generated by molecular dynamics simulations of glass-forming binary soft-sphere
mixtures. We confirm that the two-dimensional representations in both time and
frequency domains are sensitive to the dynamical heterogeneity and that it
reveals the couplings of correlated motions, which exist over a wide range of
time scales. The correlated motions detected by the three-time correlation
function is divided into mobile and immobile contributions that are determined
from the particle displacement during the first time interval. We show that the
peak positions of the correlations are in accord with the information on the
non-Gaussian parameters of the van-Hove self correlation function. Furthermore,
it is demonstrated that the progressive changes in the second time interval in
the three-time correlation function enable us to analyze how correlations in
dynamics evolve in time. From this analysis, we evaluated the lifetime of the
dynamical heterogeneity and its temperature dependence systematically. Our
results show that the lifetime of the dynamical heterogeneity becomes much
slower than the $\alpha$-relaxation time that is determined from the two-point
density correlation function when the system is highly supercooled.

by the magnetorotational instability at large Reynolds numbers Re when the
magnetic Prandtl number Pm is larger than unity. Three MHD simulations of the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the unstratified shearing box with zero
net flux are presented. These simulations are performed with the code Zeus and
consider the evolution of the rate of angular momentum transport as Re is
gradually increased from 3125 to 12500 while simultaneously keeping Pm=4. To
ensure that the small scale features of the flow are well resolved, the
resolution varies from 128 cells per disk scaleheight to 512 cells per
scaleheight. The latter constitutes the highest resolution of an MRI turbulence
simulation to date. The rate of angular momentum transport, measured using the
alpha parameter, depends only very weakly on the Reynolds number: alpha is
found to be about 0.007 with variations around this mean value bounded by 15%
in all simulations. There is no systematic evolution with Re. For the best
resolved model, the kinetic energy power spectrum tentatively displays a
power-law range with an exponent -3/2, while the magnetic energy is found to
shift to smaller and smaller scales as the magnetic Reynolds number increases.
A couple of different diagnostics both suggest a well-defined injection length
of a fraction of a scaleheight. The results presented in this letter are
consistent with the MRI being able to transport angular momentum efficiently at
large Reynolds numbers when Pm=4 in unstratified zero net flux shearing boxes.

elicit epidemic spreads on a global scale. As a result of these opposing
effects of diffusion, epidemic spreading near the epidemic threshold is the
most pronounced at an intermediate diffusion rate. The result that diffusion
can suppress epidemics contrasts with that for diffusive SIS dynamics and its

temperature rise due to mechanical heating of the medium by feedback explains
the lowering of the ratios at later evolutionary stages. Infrared pumping may
affect the CN and HNC line ratios during early evolutionary stages. Molecular

that is non-switchable and thus detrimental to ferroelectricity. Our
first-principles and model calculations demonstrate that the effect is stronger
for a larger effective ionic charge at the interface and longer screening
length due to a stronger intrinsic electric field that penetrates deeper into

using two such rings and in all the cases each ring is threaded by a magnetic
flux $\phi$ which plays the central role in the logic gate operation. We adopt
a simple tight-binding Hamiltonian to describe the model where a magnetic
quantum ring is attached to two semi-infinite one-dimensional non-magnetic
electrodes. Based on single particle Green's function formalism all the
calculations which describe two-terminal conductance and current through the
quantum ring are performed numerically. The analysis may be helpful in
fabricating mesoscopic or nano-scale logic gates.

down a system of differential equations describing isometric deformations in
the case of existence. Further we find a necessary condition of 3-ribbon
infinitesimal flexibility. For an arbitrary $n\ge 3$ we prove that every
generic $n$-ribbon surface has at most one degree of finite/infinitesimal

derive the lower bound as a function of $p$ for large enough $k$. We address
the first aspect and evaluate the lower bound on the $p$-satisfying threshold

optimized for requests where the longest dimension of the requested data
structure is time. Scalar, vector, and spectrogram time series types are
supported. The user can interact with the server by requesting a time series, a
date range, and an optional filter to apply to the data. Available filters
include strides, block average/minimum/maximum, exclude, and inequality.
Constraint expressions are supported, which allow such operations as a request
for data from one time series when a different time series satisfied a
