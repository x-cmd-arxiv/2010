magnetization dynamics at zero temperature: regular (single-mode precessional
dynamics) and chaotic. In the regular regime, the dependence of the oscillator
integrated power on frequency is linear, and consequently the dynamics is well
described by the analytical theory of current-driven magnetization dynamics for
moderate amplitudes of oscillations. We observe that for higher oscillator
amplitudes, the functional dependence of the oscillator integrated power as a
function of frequency is not a single-valued function and can be described
numerically via introduction of nonlinear oscillator power. For a range of
currents in the regular regime, the oscillator spectral linewidth is a linear
function of temperature. In the chaotic regime found at large current values,
the linewidth is not described by the analytical theory. In this regime we
observe the oscillator linewidth broadening, which originates from sudden jumps
of frequency of the oscillator arising from random domain wall nucleation and
propagation through the sample. This intermittent behavior is revealed through
a wavelet analysis that gives superior description of the frequency jumps

`alive' and `dead' quantum states; otherwise they would never die. Therefore
this proposal provides a quantum mechanical explanation to the world-wide
observation that we all pass away. Next we consider the Measurement problem in
the framework of M-theory. For this purpose, together with Schroedinger's cat
we also place inside the box Rasputin's cat, which is unaffected by poison. We
analyse the system identifying its excitations (catons and catinos) and we
discuss its evolution: either to a classical fight or to a quantum
entanglement. We also propose the $BSV\Psi$ scenario, which implements the
Complete Wave Function as well as the Big Bang and the String Landscape in a
very (super)natural way. Then we test the gravitational decoherence of the
entangled system applying an experimental setting due to Galileo. We also
discuss the Information Loss paradox. For this purpose we consider a massless
black cat falling inside a massive black hole. After that we outline a method
to compute the contribution of black cats to the dark matter of the universe.
Finally, in the spirit of Schroedinger, we propose that next generation
double-slit experiments should use cats as projectiles. Cat interferometry will
inevitably lead to the `Many Cats' interpretation of Quantum Mechanics,
allowing to shed new light on old mysteries and paradoxes. For example,
according to this interpretation, conservative estimates show that decision
making of a single domestic cat will create about 550 billion whole universes
every day, with as many replicas of itself.

low threshold and high efficiency without the creation of additional background
in ZEPLIN-III, all at a reasonable cost. Extensive experimental measurements of
the components have been made, including radioactivity levels and performance
characteristics. These have been used to inform a complete end-to-end Monte
Carlo simulation that has then been used to calculate the expected performance
of the new instrument, both operating alone and as an anti-coincidence detector
for ZEPLIN-III. The veto device will be capable of rejecting over 65% of
coincident nuclear recoil events from neutron background in the energy range of
interest in ZEPLIN-III. This will reduce the background in ZEPLIN-III from ~0.4
to ~0.14 events per year in the WIMP acceptance region, a significant factor in
the event of a non-zero observation. Furthermore, in addition to providing
valuable diagnostic capabilities, the veto is capable of tagging over 15% for
gamma-ray rejection, all whilst contributing no significant additional
background. In conjunction with the replacement of the internal ZEPLIN-III

during binary inspirals, a non-oscillatory component arises from the nonlinear
""memory"" effect, sourced by the emitted gravitational radiation. The memory
grows significantly during the late inspiral and merger, modifying the signal
by an almost step-function profile, and making it difficult to model by
approximate methods. We use numerical evolutions of binary black holes to
evaluate the nonlinear memory during late-inspiral, merger and ringdown. We
identify two main components of the signal: the monotonically growing portion
corresponding to the memory, and an oscillatory part which sets in roughly at
the time of merger and is due to the black hole ringdown. Counter-intuitively,
the ringdown is most prominent for models with the lowest total spin. Thus, the
case of maximally spinning black holes anti-aligned to the orbital angular
momentum exhibits the highest signal-to-noise (SNR) for interferometric
detectors. The largest memory offset, however, occurs for highly spinning black
holes, with an estimated value of h^tot_20 \approx 0.24 in the maximally
spinning case. These results are central to determining the detectability of
nonlinear memory through pulsar timing array measurements.

clusters by making a full use of the two-dimensional (2D) weak lensing signals
obtained from high-quality Subaru/Suprime-Cam imaging data. Our approach to
directly compare the measured lensing shear pattern with elliptical model
predictions allows us to extract new information on the mass distributions of
individual clusters, such as the halo ellipticity and mass centroid. We find
that these parameters on the cluster shape are little degenerate with cluster
mass and concentration parameters. By combining the 2D fitting results for a
subsample of 18 clusters, the elliptical shape of dark matter haloes is
detected at 7\sigma significance level. The mean ellipticity is found to be e =
0.46 \pm 0.04 (1\sigma), which is in excellent agreement with the standard
collisionless CDM model prediction. The mass centroid can be constrained with a
typical accuracy of ~20"" (~50 kpc/h) in radius for each cluster with some
significant outliers, enabling to assess one of the most important systematic
errors inherent in the stacked cluster weak lensing technique, the mass
centroid uncertainty. In addition, the shape of the dark mass distribution is
found to be only weakly correlated with that of the member galaxy distribution.
We carefully examine possible sources of systematic errors in our measurements,
finding none of them to be significant. Our results demonstrate the power of
high-quality imaging data for exploring the detailed spatial distribution of
dark matter (Abridged).

  interaction in core collapse supernovae","20 pages, 7 figures, final version now accepted to MNRAS",,"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17308.x",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A small fraction of core collapse supernovae (SNe) show evidence that the
outgoing blast wave has encountered a substantial mass ~ 1-10 M_sun of
circumstellar matter (CSM) at radii ~100-1000 AU, much more than can nominally
be explained by pre-explosion stellar winds. In extreme cases this interaction
may power the most luminous, optically-energetic SNe yet discovered.
Interpretations for the origin of the CSM have thus far centered on explosive
eruptions from the star just ~ years to decades prior to the core collapse.
Here we consider an alternative possibility that the inferred CSM is a relic
disk left over from stellar birth. We investigate this hypothesis by
calculating the evolution of proto-stellar disks around massive stars following
their early embedded phase using a self-similar accretion model. We identify an
initial gravitationally-unstable (""gravito-turbulent"") phase, followed by a
much longer period of irradiation-supported accretion during which less
effective non-gravitational forms of angular momentum transport dominate.
Although external influences, such as the presence of a wide binary companion,
may preclude disk survival in many systems, we find that massive (~1-10 M_sun)
disks can preferentially survive around the most massive stars. Reasons for
this perhaps counterintuitive include (1) the shorter stellar lifetimes and (2)
large photo-evaporation radii (~ 1000 AU) of very massive stars; (3)
suppression of the magneto-rotational instability due to the shielding from
external sources of ionization; and (4) relative invulnerability of massive
disks to lower mass stellar collisions and luminous blue variable eruptions.
Because very luminous SNe are rare, testing the relic disk model requires
constraining the presence of long-lived disks around a small fraction of very
massive stars.

we can perform near-optimal clustering of the sample points and density
estimation for mixtures of k Gaussians, efficiently. The building blocks of our
algorithm are based on the work Kalai et al. [STOC 2010] that gives an
efficient algorithm for learning mixtures of two Gaussians by considering a
series of projections down to one dimension, and applying the method of moments
to each univariate projection. A major technical hurdle in Kalai et al. is
showing that one can efficiently learn univariate mixtures of two Gaussians. In
contrast, because pathological scenarios can arise when considering univariate
projections of mixtures of more than two Gaussians, the bulk of the work in
this paper concerns how to leverage an algorithm for learning univariate
mixtures (of many Gaussians) to yield an efficient algorithm for learning in
high dimensions. Our algorithm employs hierarchical clustering and rescaling,
together with delicate methods for backtracking and recovering from failures
that can occur in our univariate algorithm. Finally, while the running time and
data requirements of our algorithm depend exponentially on the number of
Gaussians in the mixture, we prove that such a dependence is necessary.

mechanisms in heterotic and type IIB string theories and constructs an F-theory
Grand Unified Theory model for neutrino physics in which neutrino mass is
determined by the supersymmetry breaking mechanism. Focussing attention on
heterotic string theory compactified on a 4-torus, stability of
non-supersymmetric states is studied. A non-supersymmetric state with robust
stability is constructed, and its exact stability is proven in a large region
of moduli space of T^4 against all the possible decay mechanisms allowed by
charge conservation. Using string-string duality, the results are interpreted
in terms of Dirichlet-branes in type IIA string theory compactified on an
orbifold limit of a K3 surface. In type IIB string theory, metastable and
exactly stable non-supersymmetric systems are constructed using D-branes and
Calabi-Yau geometry. Branes and anti-branes wrap rigid and separate 2-spheres
inside a non-compact Calabi-Yau three-fold: supersymmetry is spontaneously
broken. These metastable vacua are analyzed in a holographic dual picture on a
complex-deformed CY3 where 2-spheres have been replaced by 3-spheres with flux
through them. By computing bosonic masses, we identify location and mode of
instability. The moduli space of this complex-deformed CY3 is studied, and
methods for studying the global phase structure of supersymmetric and
non-supersymmetric flux vacua are proposed. By turning on a varying
Neveu-Schwarz flux inside the CY3, we build meta- and exactly stable
non-supersymmetric configurations with D-branes but with no anti-D-branes.
Finally, a scenario for Dirac neutrinos in an F-theory SU(5) GUT model is
proposed. Supersymmetry breaking leads to an F-term for Higgs field which
induces a Dirac mass. A mild normal hierarchy and large mixing angles are
predicted.

proportional to the identity matrix I and the other is proportional to the

most of the other popular density functionals fail to describe this noncovalent

living in random environments whose growth is given by a regime-switching
diffusion. Harvesting acts as a (stochastic) control on the size of the
population. The objective is to find a harvesting strategy which maximizes the
expected total discounted income from harvesting {\em up to the time of
extinction} of the species; the income rate is allowed to be state- and
environment-dependent. This is a singular stochastic control problem with both
the extinction time and the optimal harvesting policy depending on the initial
condition. One aspect of receiving payments up to the random time of extinction
is that small changes in the initial population size may significantly alter
the extinction time when using the same harvesting policy. Consequently, one no
longer obtains continuity of the value function using standard arguments for
either regular or singular control problems having a fixed time horizon. This
paper introduces a new sufficient condition under which the continuity of the
value function for the regime-switching model is established. Further, it is
shown that the value function is a viscosity solution of a coupled system of
quasi-variational inequalities. The paper also establishes a verification
theorem and, based on this theorem, an $\varepsilon$-optimal harvesting
strategy is constructed under certain conditions on the model. Two examples are
analyzed in detail.

high surface gravity planets tend be found around high activity stars. We also
find a less significant positive correlation between planet mass and
chromospheric activity, but no significant correlation is seen between planet
radius and chromospheric activity. We consider the possibility that this may be
due to an observational bias against detecting lower mass planets around higher
activity stars, but conclude that this bias is only likely to affect the
detection of planets much smaller than those considered here. Finally, we
speculate on physical origins for the correlation, including the possibility
that the effect of stellar insolation on planetary radii has been significantly
underestimated, that strong UV flux evaporates planetary atmospheres, or that
high mass hot Jupiters induce activity in their host stars, but do not find any
of these hypotheses to be particularly compelling.

the Hinode satellite in association with the X1.5-class flare on 2006 December
14. The G-band enhancements originate from the footpoints of flaring coronal
magnetic loops, coinciding with non-thermal hard X-ray bremsstrahlung sources
observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager. At the
available 2 minute cadence, the G-band and hard X-ray intensities are
furthermore well correlated in time. Assuming that the G-band enhancements are
continuum emission from a blackbody, we derived the total radiative losses of
the white-light flare (white-light power). If the G-band enhancements
additionally have a contribution from lines, the derived values are
overestimates. We compare the white-light power with the power in hard X-ray
producing electrons using the thick target assumption. Independent of the
cutoff energy of the accelerated electron spectrum, the white-light power and
the power of accelerated electrons are roughly proportional. Using the observed
upper limit of ~30 keV for the cutoff energy, the hard X-ray producing
electrons provide at least a factor of 2 more power than needed to produce the
white-light emission. For electrons above 40 keV, the powers roughly match for
all four of the time intervals available during the impulsive phase. Hence, the
flare-accelerated electrons contain enough energy to produce the white-light
flare emissions. The observed correlation in time, space, and power strongly
suggests that electron acceleration and white-light production in solar flares
are closely related. However, the results also call attention to the
inconsistency in apparent source heights of the hard X-ray (chromosphere) and
white-light (upper photosphere) sources.

sample estimator is considered an important approach for enhancing portfolio
optimization. Here we empirically compare the performance of 9 improved
covariance estimation procedures by using daily returns of 90 highly
capitalized US stocks for the period 1997-2007. We find that the usefulness of
covariance matrix estimators strongly depends on the ratio between estimation
period T and number of stocks N, on the presence or absence of short selling,
and on the performance metric considered. When short selling is allowed,
several estimation methods achieve a realized risk that is significantly
smaller than the one obtained with the sample covariance method. This is
particularly true when T/N is close to one. Moreover many estimators reduce the
fraction of negative portfolio weights, while little improvement is achieved in
the degree of diversification. On the contrary when short selling is not
allowed and T>N, the considered methods are unable to outperform the sample
covariance in terms of realized risk but can give much more diversified
portfolios than the one obtained with the sample covariance. When T<N the use
of the sample covariance matrix and of the pseudoinverse gives portfolios with
very poor performance.

construction among our previous constructions of these types of optical queues
under the constraint of a limited number of recirculations must be a greedy

or a birth and death process, we often want to find a continuous stochastic
approximation so that the techniques of stochastic differential equations may
be brought to bear. One powerful and useful way to do this is the system size
expansion of van Kampen to express a trajectory as a small stochastic
perturbation to a deterministic trajectory, using a small parameter related to
the volume of the system in question. This is usually pursued only up to first
order, called the Linear Noise Approximation. The usual derivation of this
proceeds via the master equation of the discrete process and derives a
Fokker-Planck equation for the stochastic perturbation, both of which are
equations for the evolution of probability distributions. Here we present a
derivation using stochastic difference equations for the discrete process and
leading, via the chemical Langevin equation of Gillespie, directly to a
stochastic differential equation for the stochastic perturbation. The new
derivation, which does not yield the full system size expansion, draws more
explicitly on the intuition of ordinary differential equations so may be more
easily digestible for some audiences.

thermal exfoliation of graphite oxide. Several composites with different weight
% (between 0 to 25 wt %) of FGS loading in PAM have been prepared and

the existence of the amide linkage (-NHC= O) between the polymer chain and
oxygenated graphene sheets. The electrical and mechanical properties of FGS-PAM
composite films have been studied by employing low temperature dc electrical
conductivity measurement and nanoindentation technique. A significant increase
in both electrical conductivity and mechanical properties (hardness and elastic
modulus) is observed at 15 wt% loading of FGS in PAM. As the FGS loading
increases from 0 to 25 wt% the conductivity of composite film increases by
seven orders of magnitude (~5.55x10-7 to 1.42 S/cm). The hardness and elastic
modulus of FGS (~15 wt%)PAM film increased four and five fold, respectively as
compared to that of PAM film. To our knowledge studies on FGS-PAM composites
and also improvement of both the electrical and mechanical properties have not
yet been made.

proposed by Fukushima [cf. Phys. Rev. B \textbf{78}, 115105 (2008)], we analyze
different forms of the t-J Hamiltonian, i.e. modifications caused by the form
of exchange interaction, and by the presence of three-site terms. It is shown
that although the former has a small influence, the latter suppresses strongly
the superconductivity. We also analyze the temperature dependence of the gap
magnitude and compare the results with those of the recently introduced
finite-temperature renormalized mean-field theory (TRMFT) of Wang et al. [cf.

density waves. An important set of such density waves is a two-parameter family
of BPS solutions of the equations of motion of the collective field theory. One
of these parameters is essentially the average particle density, which
determines the period, while the other parameter determines the amplitude.
These BPS solutions are sometimes referred to as ""small amplitude waves"" since
they undulate around their mean density, but never vanish. We present complete
analysis of quadratic fluctuations around these BPS solutions. The
corresponding fluctuation hamiltonian (i.e., the stability operator) is
diagonalized in terms of bosonic creation and annihilation operators which
correspond to the complete orthogonal set of Bloch-Floquet eigenstates of a
related periodic Schr\""odinger hamiltonian, which we derive explicitly.
Remarkably, the fluctuation spectrum is independent of the parameter which
determines the density wave's amplitude. As a consequence, the sum over
zero-point energies of the field-theoretic fluctuation hamiltonian, and its
ensuing normal-ordering and regularization, are the same as in the case of
fluctuations around constant density background, namely, the ground state.
Thus, quadratic fluctuations do not shift the energy density tied with the
BPS-density waves studied here, compared to its ground state value. Finally, we
also make some brief remarks concerning fluctuations around non-BPS density
waves

cluster among stars in the Hipparcos Catalogue. This search is based on the

simulations of the orbits of the cluster stars in a smooth Galactic potential.
For stars within 100 pc the simulations show that it is interesting to examine
those that have small space motions relative to the Sun. From amongst the
candidate siblings thus selected there are six stars with ages consistent with
that of the Sun. Considering their radial velocities and abundances only one
potential candidate, HIP 21158, remains but essentially the result of the
search is negative. This is consistent with predictions by Portegies Zwart
(2009) on the number of siblings near the Sun. We discuss the steps that should
be taken in anticipation of the data from the Gaia mission in order to conduct
fruitful searches for the Sun's siblings in the future.

media using the nonlocal continuum model given by the peridynamic formulation.
The approach presented here provides the ability to model the macroscopic
dynamics while at the same time resolving the dynamics at the length scales of
the microstructure. Central to the methodology is a novel two-scale evolution
equation. The rescaled solution of this equation is shown to provide a strong
approximation to the actual deformation inside the peridynamic material. The
two scale evolution can be split into a microscopic component tracking the
dynamics at the length scale of the heterogeneities and a macroscopic component
tracking the volume averaged (homogenized) dynamics. The interplay between the
microscopic and macroscopic dynamics is given by a coupled system of evolution
equations. The equations show that the forces generated by the homogenized
deformation inside the medium are related to the homogenized deformation
through a history dependent constitutive relation
