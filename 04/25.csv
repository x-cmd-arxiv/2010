(zero) energy generate a canonical distribution in configuration space. Model
potentials studied consist of a single bistable mode plus transverse harmonic
modes. Interpreting the bistable mode as a reaction (isomerization) coordinate,
we establish connections with the theory of unimolecular reaction rates, in
particular the formulation of isomerization rates in terms of gap times. The
distribution of gap times (or associated lifetimes) for a microcanonical
ensemble initiated on the dividing surface is of great dynamical significance;
an exponential lifetime distribution is usually taken to be an indicator of
`statistical' behavior. Moreover, comparison of the magnitude of the phase
space volume swept out by reactive trajectories as they pass through the
reactant region with the total phase space volume (classical density of states)
for the reactant region provides a necessary condition for ergodic dynamics. We
compute gap times, associated lifetime distributions, mean gap times, reactive
fluxes, reactive volumes and total reactant phase space volumes for model
systems with 3 degrees of freedom, at three different temperatures. At all
three temperatures, the necessary condition for ergodicity is approximately
satisfied. At high temperatures a non-exponential lifetime distribution is
found, while at low temperatures the lifetime is more nearly exponential. The
degree of exponentiality of the lifetime distribution is quantified by
computing the information entropy deficit with respect to pure exponential
decay. The efficacy of the Hamiltonian isokinetic thermostat is examined by
computing coordinate distributions averaged over single long trajectories

protocols have received a good deal of attention as researchers look to enhance
overall performance of Ad Hoc networks by leveraging multi antenna enabled
nodes. To date such MAC protocols have been evaluated through comparative
simulation based studies that report on the number of concurrent links the
protocol can support. However, a bound on the maximum number of concurrent
links (MNCL) that a MIMO based MAC protocol should strive to achieve has
hitherto been unavailable. In this paper we present a theoretical formulation
for calculating the bound on the MNCL in a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) where
the nodes have multiple antenna capability, while guaranteeing a minimum
Quality of Service (QoS). In an attempt to make our findings as practical and
realistic as possible, the study incorporates models for the following PHY
layer and channel dependent elements: (a) path loss and fast fading effects, in
order to accurately model adjacent link interference; (b) a Minimum Mean
Squared Error (MMSE) based detector in the receiver which provides a balance
between completely nulling of neighboring interference and hardware complexity.
In calculating the bound on the MNCL our work also delivers the optimal power
control solution for the network as well as the optimal link selection. The
results are readily applicable to MIMO systems using Receive Diversity, Space
Time Block Coding (STBC), and Transmit Beamforming and show that with a 4
element antenna system, as much as 3x improvement in the total number of
concurrent links can be achieved relative to a SISO based network. The results
also show diminishing improvement as the number of antennas is increased beyond
4, and the maximum allowable transmit power is increased beyond 10 dBm (for the

storage nodes, using an (n,k) minimum storage regenerating (MSR) code, i.e., a
maximum distance separable (MDS) code that also allows efficient exact-repair
of any failed node. The problem of interest in this paper is to minimize the
repair bandwidth B for exact regeneration of a single failed node, i.e., the
minimum data to be downloaded by a new node to replace the failed node by its
exact replica. Previous work has shown that a bandwidth of B=[M(n-1)]/[k(n-k)]
is necessary and sufficient for functional (not exact) regeneration. It has
also been shown that if k < = max(n/2, 3), then there is no extra cost of exact
regeneration over functional regeneration. The practically relevant setting of
low-redundancy, i.e., k/n>1/2 remains open for k>3 and it has been shown that
there is an extra bandwidth cost for exact repair over functional repair in
this case. In this work, we adopt into the distributed storage context an
asymptotically optimal interference alignment scheme previously proposed by
Cadambe and Jafar for large wireless interference networks. With this scheme we
solve the problem of repair bandwidth minimization for (n,k) exact-MSR codes
for all (n,k) values including the previously open case of k > \max(n/2,3). Our
main result is that, for any (n,k), and sufficiently large file sizes, there is
no extra cost of exact regeneration over functional regeneration in terms of
the repair bandwidth per bit of regenerated data. More precisely, we show that
in the limit as M approaches infinity, the ratio B/M = (n-1)/(k(n-k))$.

emission is slightly better correlated with emission at 70um than at 24um. In
the area 6kpc<R< 17kpc, the total SFR is ~0.3Msun/yr. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law
between SFR and total gas has a power-law index of 1.30+-0.05 in the radial
range of R=7-11kpc increasing by about 0.3 for R=11-13kpc. The lack of H2 in

approximations, which can accurately describe nonlinear screening only by
incorporating an effective (renormalized) macroion charge. Combining charge
renormalization and linearized PB theories, in both the cell model and an
effective-interaction (cell-free) model, we compute osmotic pressures of highly
charged colloids and monovalent microions over a range of concentrations. By
comparing predictions with primitive model simulation data for salt-free
suspensions, and with predictions of nonlinear PB theory for salty suspensions,
we chart the limits of both the cell model and linear-screening approximations
in modeling bulk thermodynamic properties. Up to moderately strong
electrostatic couplings, the cell model proves accurate in predicting osmotic
pressures of deionized suspensions. With increasing salt concentration,
however, the relative contribution of macroion interactions grows, leading
predictions of the cell and effective-interaction models to deviate. No
evidence is found for a liquid-vapour phase instability driven by monovalent
microions. These results may guide applications of PB theory to soft materials.

then must be divided among the participants. Potential contracts and their
surplus are represented by weighted edges in our bipartite network. Each agent
in the market is additionally limited by a capacity representing the number of
contracts which he or she may undertake. When all agents are limited to just
one contract each, prior research applied natural generalizations of the Nash
bargaining solution to the networked setting, defined the new solution concepts
of stable and balanced, and characterized the resulting bargaining outcomes. We
simplify and generalize these results to a setting in which participants in
only one side of the market are limited to one contract each. The heart of our
results uses a linear-programming formulation to establish a novel connection
between well-studied cooperative game theory concepts (such as core and
prekernel) and the solution concepts of stable and balanced defined for the
bargaining games. This immediately implies one can take advantage of the
results and algorithms in cooperative game theory to reproduce results such as
those of Azar et al. [1] and Kleinberg and Tardos [29] and also generalize them
to our setting. The cooperative-game-theoretic connection also inspires us to
refine our solution space using standard solution concepts from that literature
such as nucleolus and lexicographic kernel. The nucleolus is particularly
attractive as it is unique, always exists, and is supported by experimental
data in the network bargaining literature. Guided by algorithms from
cooperative game theory, we show how to compute the nucleolus by pruning and
iteratively solving a natural linear-programming formulation.

with a lens magnification factor of about 5 for the A and B components. We also
discovered a new arc belonging to another lensed high-z source galaxy, which
makes this lens system a potential double Einstein ring system. Using the high
S/N rest-frame optical spectra covering H+K band, we detected Hbeta, OIII,
Halpha, NII and SII emission lines. Detailed physical properties of this high-z

higher than that towards stellar continuum (E_s(B-V)), derived from the optical
and NIR broad band photometry fitting. The metallicity was estimated using N2
and O3N2 indices. It is in the range of 1/5-1/3 solar abundance, which is much
lower than the typical z~2 star-forming galaxies. From the flux ratio of SII
6717 and 6732, we found that the electron number density of the HII regions in
the high-z galaxy were >1000 cm^-3, consistent with other z~2 galaxies but much
higher than that in local HII regions. The star-formation rate was estimated
via the Halpha luminosity, after correction for the lens magnification, to be
about 365\pm69 Msun/yr. Combining the FWHM of Halpha emission lines and the
half-light radius, we found the dynamical mass of the lensed galaxy is
5.8\pm0.9x10^10 Msun. The gas mass is 5.1\pm1.1x10^10~Msun from the H\alpha

the potential of direct synthesis of a given permutation to reduce both quantum

always converges and typically synthesizes a given specification very fast

When entanglement is extended from just two quantum bits (qubits) to three, the
incompatibilities between classical and quantum correlation properties can
change from a violation of inequalities involving statistical averages to sign
differences in deterministic observations. With the ample confirmation of
quantum mechanical predictions by experiments, entanglement has evolved from a
philosophical conundrum to a key resource for quantum-based technologies, like
quantum cryptography and computation. In particular, maximal entanglement of
more than two qubits is crucial to the implementation of quantum error
correction protocols. While entanglement of up to 3, 5, and 8 qubits has been
demonstrated among spins, photons, and ions, respectively, entanglement in
engineered solid-state systems has been limited to two qubits. Here, we
demonstrate three-qubit entanglement in a superconducting circuit, creating
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states with fidelity of 88%, measured with
quantum state tomography. Several entanglement witnesses show violation of
bi-separable bounds by 830\pm80%. Our entangling sequence realizes the first

In this paper we address the issue of trust advisory and establishment in
mobile networks, with application to ad hoc networks, including DTNs. We
utilize encounters in mobile societies in novel ways, noticing that mobility
provides opportunities to build proximity, location and similarity based trust.
Four new trust advisor filters are introduced - including encounter frequency,
duration, behavior vectors and behavior matrices - and evaluated over an
extensive set of real-world traces collected from a major university. Two sets
of statistical analyses are performed; the first examines the underlying
encounter relationships in mobile societies, and the second evaluates DTN
routing in mobile peer-to-peer networks using trust and selfishness models. We
find that for the analyzed trace, trust filters are stable in terms of growth
with time (3 filters have close to 90% overlap of users over a period of 9
weeks) and the results produced by different filters are noticeably different.
In our analysis for trust and selfishness model, our trust filters largely undo
the effect of selfishness on the unreachability in a network. Thus improving
the connectivity in a network with selfish nodes.
  We hope that our initial promising results open the door for further research
on proximity-based trust.

information on the structure of hadrons and ultimately the structure of matter
and on the nature of interactions between leptons and hadrons, since the
discovery of partons. Various high energy deep inelastic interactions lead to
different evolution equations from which we obtain various structure functions
giving information about the partons i.e. quarks and gluons involved in
different scattering processes. Actually structure function is a mathematical
picture of the hadron structure in the high energy region. Understanding the
behaviour of the structure functions of the nucleon at low-x, where x is the
Bjorken variable, is interesting both theoretically and phenomenologically.
Structure functions are important inputs in many high energy processes and also
important for examination of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (PQCD), the
underlying dynamics of quarks and gluons. In PQCD, for high-Q2, where Q2 is the
four momentum transfer in a DIS process, the Q2-evolutions of these densities
(at fixed-x) are given by mainly Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi
(DGLAP) Evolution Equations. In this thesis, we solved both spin-independent
and spin-dependent DGLAP evolution equations applying Regge behaviour of
structure functions at low-x up-to next-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and have
got the respective approximate analytical solutions of structure functions.

relevance of the $\theta$-twistor as a supersymmetric twistor alternative to
the well-known supertwistor. The minimal breaking of superconformal symmetry is
an inherent property of the $\theta$-twistor received from its fermionic
components, described by a Grassmannian vector instead of a Grassmannian scalar

motion in micro viewpoint. On the other hand, the thermo mechanics is
definitely related with geometrical configuration motion (phase) in macro
viewpoint. On this sense, the thermomechanics should be formulated by two kinds
of motion: quantum motion and configuration motion. Its principle goal ought to
be bridge the gap between atomic physics and engineering practice. In this
research, the configuration motion is formulated by deformation geometrical
field (motion transformation tensor). The quantum motion is formulated by the
wave function of quantum state. Based on these two fields, the thermo stress is
formulated as the coupling of quantum motion and configuration motion. Along
this line, the entropy is interpreted and formulated according to
thermodynamics rules. For scalar entropy, the traditional meaning of entropy is
reserved. For infinitesimal configuration variation, the formulation is
degenerated to the traditional elasticity deformation. For large random
configuration deformation, the formulation is degenerated to the statistical
physics methods. This research supplies a possible formulation to bridge the
gap between the macro deformation and the micro quantum motion.

sporadic star formation events at the present day, whereas red LSBGs are more
likely to form stars continuously over the past 1-2 Gyr. Moreover, the fraction
of galaxies that experienced recent sporadic formation events decreases with
increasing stellar mass. Furthermore, two sub-samples are defined for both red

log(M_\star/M_\odot) <= 10.3, and the surface brightness limiting sub-sample
with \mu_0(R) <= 20.7 mag arcsec^{-2}. They show consistent results with the

analytic solution for tachyon condensation recently found by Erler and Schnabl.
It is found that the level expansion of the string field terminates at level 3.
We find that the closed string vacuum is a saddle point of the classical
action. We also evaluate the effective potential for tachyon field. The closed
string vaccum becomes stable by integrationg out an auxiliary field. It is
found that the effective potential is bounded below hence has no runaway
direction. We also argue validity of simple identity based solution.

arisen from the tunneling effect in the experimental realization of the quantum
walk, on the one-dimensional discreet time quantum walk. We show that in the
regime of this type of noise the quantum behavior of the walker does not fade,
in contrary to the coin decoherence for which the walker undergos the
quantum-to-classical transition even for weak noise. Particularly, we show that
the quadratic dependency of the variance on the time and also the coin-position
entanglement, i.e. two important quantum aspects of the coherent quantum walk,
are preserved in the presence of tunneling decoherence. Furthermore, we present
an explicit expression for the probability distribution of decoherent
one-dimensional quantum walk in terms of the corresponding coherent
probabilities, and show that this type of decoherence smooths the probability
distribution.

oscillations which turns out to be related to the Fermi wavevector of the Fermi
sea and in particular on how this dispersion emerges as a collective effect in
the thermodynamic limit. We show by symmetry that the dispersion is temperature
independent for a half-filled system. We also discuss the adiabatic coherent
collective response of the particle to an applied field.

require a realistic plan against unpredictable emergencies and disasters.
Existing emergency systems (e.g., 911, campus-wide alerts) are quite useful,
but provide delayed response (often tens of minutes) and do not utilize
proximity or locality. There is a need to augment such systems with
proximity-based systems for more immediate response to attempt to prevent and
deter crime. In this paper we propose SHIELD, an on-campus emergency rescue and
alert management service. It is a fully distributed infrastructure-less
platform based on proximity-enabled trust and cooperation. It relies on
localized responses, sent using Bluetooth and/or WiFi on the fly to achieve
minimal response time and maximal availability thereby augmenting the
traditional notion of emergency services. Analysis of campus crime statistics
and WLAN traces surprisingly show a strong positive correlation (over 55%)
between on-campus crime statistics and spatio-temporal density distribution of
on-campus mobile users. This result provides a motivation to develop such
platform and points to the promise in reducing crime incidences. We also show
an implementation of a prototype application to be used in such scenarios.

tunnels provide a means to covertly infiltrate and exfiltrate large amounts of

detecting DNS tunnels by analyzing the unigram, bigram, and trigram character
frequencies of domains in DNS queries and responses. It is empirically shown
how domains follow Zipf's law in a similar pattern to natural languages,
whereas tunneled traffic has more evenly distributed character frequencies.
This approach allows tunnels to be detected across multiple domains, whereas
previous methods typically concentrate on monitoring point to point systems.
Anomalies are quickly discovered when tunneled traffic is compared to the
character frequency fingerprint of legitimate domain traffic.

  manuscript",,,,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phenomenological and numerical studies of the small scale spectra of energy
are presented for high Reynolds number rotating Boussinesq flows in unit
aspect-ratio domains. We introduce a non-dimensional parameter Gamma such that
when the potential vorticity is nearly linear in the dynamical variables, we
deduce that for Gamma much less than 1, the potential enstrophy suppresses the
transfer of horizontal kinetic energy into wavemodes with large horizontal
component k_h while forcing it to become independent of vertical wavevector
component k_z, scaling as k_h^{-5}. When Gamma much greater than 1, the
potential enstrophy suppresses the transfer of potential energy into the
wavemodes with large vertical component k_z while forcing it to become
independent of k_h, scaling as k_z^{-5) power. Spectra computed from
high-resolution simulations of the Boussinesq equations with isotropic
low-wavenumber forcing are used to explore such anisotropic constraints on the
energy and provide a posteriori justification for the joint flux ansatz used to
obtain the (-5) scaling exponent. In all cases the empirical evidence points to
both energy and potential enstrophy being jointly transferred downscale with
the spectral scaling of the the former constrained by the latter.
