of the oscillation spectrum, the effect of mutual friction force on the
oscillations and the hydrodynamical spin-up phase of pulsar glitches. We
linearise the dynamical equations of a Newtonian two-fluid model for rapidly
rotating backgrounds. In the axisymmetric equilibrium configurations, the two
fluid components corotate and are in beta-equilibrium. We use analytical
equations of state that generate stratified and non-stratified stellar models,
which enable us to study the coupling between the dynamical degrees of freedom
of the system. By means of time evolutions of the linearised dynamical
equations, we determine the spectrum of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric
oscillation modes, accounting for the contribution of the gravitational
potential perturbations, i.e. without adopting the Cowling approximation. We
study the mutual friction damping of the superfluid oscillations and consider
the effects of the non-dissipative part of the mutual friction force on the
mode frequencies. We also provide technical details and relevant tests for the
hydrodynamical model of pulsar glitches discussed by Sidery, Passamonti and
Andersson (2010). In particular, we describe the method used to generate the
initial data that mimic the pre-glitch state, and derive the equations that are
used to extract the gravitational-wave signal.

accompanying large NP effects in the B_d system are disfavoured. However this

The results support a conjecture that there exists a companion of mass ~ 1-4
M_Jup orbiting in the innermost region of the outer Oort cloud. Our most
restrictive prediction is that the orientation angles of the orbit normal in
galactic coordinates are centered on the galactic longitude of the ascending
node Omega = 319 degree and the galactic inclination i = 103 degree (or the
opposite direction) with an uncertainty in the normal direction subtending ~ 2%
of the sky. A Bayesian statistical analysis suggests that the probability of
the companion hypothesis is comparable to or greater than the probability of
the null hypothesis of a statistical fluke. Such a companion could also have
produced the detached Kuiper Belt object Sedna. The putative companion could be
easily detected by the recently launched Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer

switching and broad application support. There are two technologies for AON:
Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) and Optical Time Division Multiplexed
(OTDM). OTDM transmission systems are becoming increasingly important as one of
the key technologies satisfying the growing demand for large capacity optical
networks. Although OTDM has several advantages in terms of operation system,
such as natural accommodation of higher bit rate payloads, it introduces many
security vulnerabilities, which do not exist in traditional networks. One of
the serious problems with OTDM is the fact that optical crosstalk is additive,
and thus the aggregate effect of crosstalk over a whole all-optical network
(AON) may be more nefarious than a single point of crosstalk. This is because
crosstalk can spread rapidly through the network, causing additional awkward
failures and triggering multiple undesirable alarms. This results in the
continuous monitoring and identification of the impairments becoming
challenging in the event of transmission failures. In this paper we propose a
novel approach for detecting and localizing crosstalk in OTDM transmission
systems that can participate in some tasks for fault management in optical

this process is investigated for the case when a linear feedback scheme is

Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with noisy feedback. To begin, we look to derive
the optimal linear feedback scheme by optimizing over the received

linear feedback scheme is implemented as an inner code to a concatenated code
over the AWGN channel with noisy feedback. This code shows improvements not
only in error exponent bounds, but also in bit-error-rate and frame-error-rate.
It is also shown that the if the concatenated code has total blocklength L and
the inner code has blocklength, N, the inner code blocklength should scale as N

that the total magnetic helicity can reach a steady state value only through

their lowest in 75 years. During this unique solar minimum epoch, however,
solar wind high - speed streams emanating from near-equatorial coronal holes
occurred frequently and were the primary contributor to the recurrent
geomagnetic activity at Earth. These conditions enabled the isolation of
forcing by geomagnetic activity on the preconditioned solar minimum state of
the upper atmosphere caused by Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs).
Thermosphere density observations around 400 km from the CHAMP satellite are
used to study the thermosphere density response to solar wind high - speed
streams/CIRs. Superposed epoch results show that thermosphere density responds
to high - speed streams globally, and the density at 400 km changes by 75% on
average. The relative changes of neutral density are comparable at different
latitudes, although its variability is largest at high latitudes. In addition,
the response of thermosphere density to high - speed streams is larger at night
than in daytime, indicating the preconditioning effect of the thermosphere
response to storms. Finally, the thermosphere density variations at the periods
of 9 and 13.5 days associated with CIRs are linked to the spatial distribution
of low - middle latitude coronal holes on the basis of the EUVI observations

tidal field of a Virgo like galaxy cluster. The model is applied to small,
late-type dwarf disc galaxies (of substantially lower mass than in previous
harassment simulations) as they infall into the cluster from the outskirts.
These dwarf galaxies are only mildly affected by high speed tidal encounters
with little or no observable consequences; typical stellar losses are $<10\%$,
producing very low surface brightness streams ($\mu_B > 31$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$),
and a factor of two drop in dynamical mass-to-light ratio. Final stellar discs
remain disc-like, and dominated by rotation although often with tidally induced
spiral structure. By means of Monte-Carlo simulations, the statistically likely
influences of harassment on infalling dwarf galaxies are determined. The
effects of harassment are found to be highly dependent on the orbit of the
galaxy within the cluster, such that newly accreted dwarf galaxies typically
suffer only mild harassment. Strong tidal encounters, that can morphologically
transform discs into spheroidals, are rare occurring in $<15 \%$ of dwarf
galaxy infalls for typical orbits of sub-structure within $\Lambda$CDM cluster
mass halos. For orbits with small apocentric distances ($<$250 kpc), harassment
is significantly stronger resulting in complete disruption or heavy mass loss
($>90 \%$ dark matter and $> 50 \%$ stellar), however, such orbits are expected
to be highly improbable for newly infalling galaxies due to the deep potential
well of the cluster.

folding. For mechanically induced bond rupture, the bond-rupture kinetics may
be governed by loading device. However, the role of loading device on the
kinetics of mechanical rupture has been rarely received much attention until
recently. In this work, we have theoretically and/or computationally studied
the effect of loading-device stiffness on the kinetics of mechanical unfolding.
Specifically, we have considered a one-dimensional model for a bond rupture
whose kinetics is depicted by Kramers' theory. It is elucidated that the
kinetics of bond rupture is determined by force constant of loading device. The
Brownian dynamics simulation of a bond rupture is considered in order to
validate our theory. It is illustrated that the mean rupture force is dependent
on the force constant of a loading device, such that increase in the
loading-device stiffness leads to the higher bond rupture force. Moreover, we
have taken into account the computational simulation of mechanical unfolding of
a small protein, i.e. {\beta}-hairpin. Our simulation shows that unfolding
force is highly correlated with the stiffness of a loading device. Our
numerical and theoretical studies highlight the significance of a loading
device on the kinetics of mechanical unfolding of a chemical bond and/or a
folded domain in the single-molecule mechanical experiments.

soliton solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation. The
classification is based on the far-field patterns of the solutions which
consist of a finite number of line-solitons. Each soliton solution is then
defined by a point of the totally non-negative Grassmann variety which can be
parametrized by a unique derangement of the symmetric group of permutations.
Our study also includes certain numerical stability problems of those soliton
solutions. Numerical simulations of the initial value problems indicate that
certain class of initial waves asymptotically approach to these exact solutions
of the KP equation. We then discuss an application of our theory to the Mach
reflection problem in shallow water. This problem describes the resonant
interaction of solitary waves appearing in the reflection of an obliquely
incident wave onto a vertical wall, and it predicts an extra-ordinary four-fold
amplification of the wave at the wall. There are several numerical studies
confirming the prediction, but all indicate disagreements with the KP theory.
Contrary to those previous numerical studies, we find that the KP theory
actually provides an excellent model to describe the Mach reflection phenomena
when the higher order corrections are included to the quasi-two dimensional
approximation. We also present laboratory experiments of the Mach reflection
recently carried out by Yeh and his colleagues, and show how precisely the KP
theory predicts this wave behavior.

regularization invariant momentum-subtraction(RI/MOM) schemes. Subsequently,
matching factors, computed in continuum perturbation theory, are used in order
to convert these quark masses from a RI/MOM scheme to the MS-bar scheme. We
calculate the two-loop corrections in quantum chromodynamics(QCD) to these
matching factors as well as the three-loop mass anomalous dimensions for the
RI/SMOM and RI/SMOM_gamma_mu schemes. These two schemes are characterized by a
symmetric subtraction point. Providing the conversion factors in the two
different schemes allows for a better understanding of the systematic
uncertainties. The two-loop expansion coefficients of the matching factors for
both schemes turn out to be small compared to the traditional RI/MOM schemes.
For nf=3 quark flavors they are about 0.6-0.7% and 2%, respectively, of the
leading order result at scales of about 2 GeV. Therefore, they will allow for a
significant reduction of the systematic uncertainty of light quark mass
determinations obtained through this approach. The determination of these
matching factors requires the computation of amputated Green's functions with
the insertions of quark bilinear operators. As a by-product of our calculation
we also provide the corresponding results for the tensor operator.

(GCs) hold important clues to the origin of the Milky Way halo and its
substructures. Aims: We study the chemical composition of red giant stars in
Pal 4 - one of the most remote GCs in the Milky Way - and compare our abundance
measurements to those for both low surface brightness dwarf galaxies, and GCs
in the inner and the outer halo. Methods: By co-adding high-resolution, low-S/N
Keck/HIRES spectra of 19 stars along the red giant branch, we estimate chemical
abundance ratios of 20 alpha-, iron peak-, and neutron-capture elements. Our
method gives total uncertainties on most element-to-iron ratios of typically
0.2 dex. Results: We measure [Fe/H] = -1.41 +- 0.04 (statistical) +- 0.17
(systematic) and an alpha-enhancement of [alpha/Fe] = +0.38 +- 0.11 dex, which
is consistent with the canonical value of +0.4 dex found for Galactic halo
field stars and most halo GCs at this metallicity. Although Pal 4 has higher
enhancements in the heavier elements with respect to the halo, the majority of
the element ratios are, within the measurement errors, consistent with those
for local halo field stars. We find, however, evidence for a lower [Mg/Ca]
ratio than in other halo clusters. Conclusions: Based on the available
evidence, we conclude that the material from which Pal 4 and the Galactic halo
formed experienced similar enrichment processes, despite the apparently younger
age of this cluster. Within the limitations of our methodology we find no
significant indication of an iron spread, as is typical of genuine GCs of the
Milky Way. However, abundance ratios for individual stars in Pal 4 and other
distant satellites are urgently needed to understand the relationship, if any,
between remote GCs and other halo substructures (i.e., luminous and ultra-faint
dwarf spheroidal galaxies).

the velocity range V_opt=90-260 km/s, and is consistent with V_opt = V_maxh

exception of early-type galaxies with V_opt simeq 350 km/s. This is
inconsistent with early-type galaxies being, in general, globally isothermal.
For low mass (V_opt < 250 km/s) early-types V_opt > V_maxh, indicating that
baryons have modified the potential well, while high mass (V_opt > 400 km/s)
early-types have V_opt < V_maxh. Folding in measurements of the black hole mass
- velocity dispersion relation, our results imply that the supermassive black
hole - halo mass relation has a logarithmic slope which varies from ~1.4 at
halo masses of ~10^{12} Msun/h to ~0.65 at halo masses of 10^{13.5} Msun/h. The
values of V_opt/V_200 we infer for the Milky Way and M31 are lower than the
values currently favored by direct observations and dynamical models. This
offset is due to the fact that the Milky Way and M31 have higher V_opt and
lower V_200 compared to typical late-type galaxies of the same stellar masses.
We show that current high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations
are unable to form galaxies which simultaneously reproduce both the V_opt/V_200

A$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$ (A = Y or rare-earth elements) is investigated by taking
into account the strong spin-orbit coupling and trigonal crystal field effect.
It is found that the trigonal crystal field effect, which is always present in
real systems, may destabilize the topological insulator proposed for the ideal
cubic crystal field, leading to a metallic ground state. Thus the trigonal
crystal field is an important control parameter for the metal-insulator
changeover. We propose that this could be one of the reasons why distinct low
temperature ground states may arise for the pyrochlore iridates with different
A-site ions. On the other hand, examining the electron-lattice coupling, we
find that softening of the $\textbf{q}$=0 modes corresponding to trigonal or
tetragonal distortions of the Ir pyrochlore lattice leads to the resurrection
of the strong topological insulator. Thus, in principle, a finite temperature
transition to a low-temperature topological insulator can occur via structural
changes. We also suggest that the application of the external pressure along
[111] or its equivalent directions would be the most efficient way of
generating strong topological insulators in pyrochlore iridates.

to a quantum phase transition between a spin polarized phase and a

favors the topological phase. For some realizations of disorder, topological
order can be robust against arbitrarily strong magnetic fields. In the case of
the toric code in a random \pm h field, we show that the system exhibits a
quantum phase transition to a spin glass phase in an appropriate dual variables

directly related to the percolation properties of the rigid lattice in the
Edwards-Anderson bimodal spin glass model. According to recent numerical
results for this model [Phys. Rev. B 82, 214401 (2010)], it is likely that the

further split into two components with different radial velocities. Whereas the
wing broadening of the overall profile can be fitted with a low-intensity broad

two separate shell-like wings. We have analysed the impact that the presence of

of nature. Unfortunately, this proposal is only feasible if the gravitino is
heavy enough to be measured at colliders, and this condition is in direct
conflict with constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). In this work, we
show that the BBN bound can be naturally evaded in the presence of multiple

channel of the LOSP to a goldstino. Certain regions of parameter space allow
for a direct measurement of LOSP decays into both the goldstino and the
gravitino at the LHC. If the goldstino/gravitino mass ratio is measured to be
2, as suggested by theory, then this would provide dramatic verification of the
existence of multiple supersymmetry breaking and sequestering. A variety of
consistent cosmological scenarios are obtained within this framework. In
particular, if an R symmetry is imposed, then the gauge-gaugino-goldstino

cosmological information or to study the nature of dark energy through the
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) probe. In this work we present a detailed

also the possibility of a shot-noise component and partial sky coverage.

properties of galaxies that arise in a LambdaCDM hydrodynamical simulation of
the local universe. The present-day distribution of matter was constructed to
match the observed large scale pattern of the IRAS 1.2-Jy galaxy survey. Our
simulation follows the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cosmological
sphere with a volume of ~130^3 (Mpc/h)^3 including supernova feedback, galactic
winds, photoheating due to an uniform meta-galactic background and chemical
enrichment of the gas and stellar populations. However, we do not consider
AGNs. In the simulation, a total of ~20000 galaxies are formed above the
resolution limit, and around 60 haloes are more massive than ~10^14 M_sun.
Luminosities of the galaxies are calculated based on a stellar population
synthesis model including the attenuation by dust, which is calculated from the
cold gas left within the simulated galaxies. Environmental effects like colour
bi-modality and differential clustering power of the hydrodynamical galaxies
are qualitatively similar to observed trends. Nevertheless, the overcooling
present in the simulations lead to too blue and overluminous brightest cluster
galaxies (BCGs). To overcome this, we mimic the late-time suppression of star
formation in massive halos by ignoring recently formed stars with the aid of a
simple post-processing recipe. In this way we find luminosity functions, both
for field and group/cluster galaxies, in better agreement with observations.
Specifically, the BCGs then follow the observed luminosity-halo mass relation.
However, in such a case, the colour bi-modality is basically lost, pointing
towards a more complex interplay of late suppression of star formation than
what is given by the simple scheme adopted.

to the accretion of planetesimals and the selective enrichment of the star with

CoRoT-2b and CoRoT-4b. Adding data for CoRoT-3 and CoRoT-5 from the literature,

and intensity of its Li I resonance line permit us to propose an age of 120
Myr, making this stars one of the youngest stars with planets to date. We
introduce a new methodology to investigate a relation between the abundances of
these stars and the internal migration of their planets. By simulating the
internal migration of a planet in a disk formed only by planetesimals, we are
able to separate the stellar fractions of refractory (R), intermediate (I), and
volatile (V) rich planetesimals accreting onto the central star. Intermediate
and volatile element fractions enriching the star are similar and much larger
than those of pure refractory ones. We also show that these results are highly
dependent on the model adopted for the disk distribution regions in terms of R,
I, and V elements and other parameters considered. We note however, that this
self-enrichment mechanism is only efficient during the first 20-30 Myr or later
in the lifetime of the disk when the surface convection layers of the central

called the quasihorizon, defined by its own gravitational radius. We elucidate
under which conditions a quasiblack hole can form under the presence of matter
with nonzero pressure. It is supposed that in the outer region an extremal
quasihorizon forms, whereas inside, the quasihorizon can be either nonextremal
or extremal. It is shown that in both cases, nonextremal or extremal inside, a
well-defined quasiblack hole always admits a continuous pressure at its own
quasihorizon. Both the nonextremal and extremal cases inside can be divided
into two situations, one in which there is no electromagnetic field, and the
other in which there is an electromagnetic field. The situation with no
electromagnetic field requires a negative matter pressure (tension) on the
boundary. On the other hand, the situation with an electromagnetic field
demands zero matter pressure on the boundary. So in this situation an
electrified quasiblack hole can be obtained by the gradual compactification of
a relativistic star with the usual zero pressure boundary condition. For the
nonextremal case inside the density necessarily acquires a jump on the
boundary, a fact with no harmful consequences whatsoever, whereas for the
extremal case the density is continuous at the boundary. For the extremal case
inside we also state and prove the proposition that such a quasiblack hole
cannot be made from phantom matter at the quasihorizon. The regularity
condition for the extremal case, but not for the nonextremal one, can be
obtained from the known regularity condition for usual black holes.

This method can be used to semi-analytically study the structure of defects at

non-Markovian reservoir has dual effects on the system: dissipation and
backaction. The dissipation exhausts the coherence of the quantum system,
whereas the backaction revives it. Moreover, we design the control Hamiltonian
with the control laws attained by the stochastic optimal control and the
corresponding optimal principle. At last, we considered the exact decoherence
dynamics of a qubit in a dissipative reservoir composed of harmonic
oscillators, and demonstrated the effectiveness of our optimal control
strategy. Simulation results showed that the coherence will completely lost in
the absence of control neither in non-Markovian nor Markovian system. However,
the optimal feedback control steers it to a stationary stochastic process which
fluctuates around the target. In this case the decoherence can be controlled
effectively, which indicates that the engineered artificial reservoirs with

We test this assumption with a fully non-parametric, adaptive grid method, with
no knowledge of the galaxy distribution. Differences between the methods are
seen on fine scales due to member galaxies which must be included in models

distribution of dark matter is in good agreement, with very similar radial mass

that for sufficiently high Weissenberg numbers, this branch becomes unstable.
This instability is strongly sub-critical and is associated with a shear stress
jump. We find that this increase of the flow resistance is related to the
nucleation of turbulence. The flow pattern shows similarities with the elastic
turbulence, so far only observed for polymer solutions. The unstable character
of this branch led us to propose a scenario that could account for the recent
observations of Taylor-like vortices during the shear banding flow of wormlike
micelles.

when dimension is 2 or more, and when the cluster has volume $n^d$, it is known
that fluctuations of the radius are at most of order $n^{1/3}$. We improve this

closely related cluster growth model, that we call the flashing process, whose
fluctuations are controlled easily and accurately. This process is coupled to
internal DLA to yield the desired bound.

semi-analytic results for low energetic starbursts, evolving in a
quasi-adiabatic regime, and extend them to more powerful starbursts evolving in
the catastrophic cooling regime. The simulations show a bimodal hydrodynamic
solution in all cases. They present a quasi-stationary accretion flow onto the
black hole, defined by the matter reinserted by massive stars within the
stagnation volume and a stationary starburst wind, driven by the high thermal
pressure acquired in the region between the stagnation and the starburst radii.
In the catastrophic cooling regime, the stagnation radius rapidly approaches
the surface of the starburst region, as one considers more massive starbursts.
This leads to larger accretion rates onto the SMBH and concurrently to powerful
winds able to inhibit interstellar matter from approaching the nuclear
starburst.
  Our self-consistent model thus establishes a direct physical link between the
SMBH accretion rate and the nuclear star formation activity of the host galaxy

highlight an anomalously large band renormalization at high binding energies in
cuprate superconductors: the high energy ""waterfall"" or high energy anomaly
(HEA). The anomaly is present for both hole- and electron-doped cuprates as
well as the half-filled parent insulators with different energy scales arising
on either side of the phase diagram. While photoemission matrix elements
clearly play a role in changing the aesthetic appearance of the band
dispersion, i.e. creating a ""waterfall""-like appearance, they provide an
inadequate description for the physics that underlies the strong band
renormalization giving rise to the HEA. Model calculations of the single-band
Hubbard Hamiltonian showcase the role played by correlations in the formation
of the HEA and uncover significant differences in the HEA energy scale for
hole- and electron-doped cuprates. In addition, this approach properly captures
the transfer of spectral weight accompanying doping in a correlated material
and provides a unifying description of the HEA across both sides of the cuprate
phase diagram. We find that the anomaly demarcates a transition, or cross-over,
from a quasiparticle band at low binding energies near the Fermi level to
valence bands at higher binding energy, assumed to be of strong oxygen
character.

continuous time stationary stochastic process is the minimum separation between
successively observed samples of the process. When the underlying process is
not band-limited, sampling at any uniform rate leads to aliasing, while certain
stochastic sampling schemes, including Poisson process sampling, are rendered
infeasible by the constraint of minimum separation. It is shown in this paper
that, subject to this constraint, no point process sampling scheme is
alias-free for the class of all spectra. It turns out that point process
sampling under this constraint can be alias-free for band-limited spectra.
However, the usual construction of a consistent spectrum estimator does not
work in such a case. Simulations indicate that a commonly used estimator, which
is consistent in the absence of this constraint, performs poorly when the
constraint is present. These results should help practitioners in rationalizing
their expectations from point process sampling as far as spectrum estimation is
concerned, and motivate researchers to look for appropriate estimators of

an important task towards scalable quantum information processing (QIP) is to
efficiently write and read entanglement generated from a SPDC source into and

realization of a quantum interface by building a 5 MHz frequency-uncorrelated
SPDC source and reversibly mapping the generated entangled photons into and out
of a remote optically thick cold atomic memory using electromagnetically
induced transparency. The frequency correlation between the entangled photons
is almost fully eliminated with a suitable pump pulse. The storage of a
triggered single photon with arbitrary polarization is shown to reach an
average fidelity of 92% for 200 ns storage time. Moreover,
polarization-entangled photon pairs are prepared, and one of photons is stored
in the atomic memory while the other keeps flying. The CHSH Bell's inequality
is measured and violation is clearly observed for storage time up to 1
microsecond. This demonstrates the entanglement is stored and survives during
the storage. Our work establishes a crucial element to implement scalable
all-optical QIP, and thus presents a substantial progress in quantum

spectral phase variations associated with nonzero dispersion coupled with

dramatic new spectral interference effect, which can be used to monitor
temporal dispersion purely in the spectral domain. We expect the effects we

recently been expanded by including generic spin-orbit-coupled semiconductors

anyonic statistics using Majorana fermion interferometry in this system is a
necessary first step towards topological quantum computation (TQC). However,
since all isolated chiral edges that can be created in the semiconductor are
charge neutral, it is not clear if electrically controlled interferometry is
possible in this system. Here we show that when two isolated chiral Majorana
edges are brought into close contact, the resultant interface supports charge
current, enabling electrically controlled Majorana fermion interferometry in
the semiconductor structure. Such interferometry experiments on the
semiconductor are analogous to similar interferometry experiments on the
$\nu=5/2$ fractional quantum Hall systems and on the surface of a 3D strong
topological insulator, illustrating the usefulness of the 2D semiconductor
heterostructure as a suitable TQC platform. In particular, we proposed Majorana
interferometers may be the most direct method for establishing non-Abelian
braiding statistics in topological superconductors.

Distinguishing them from one another requires strong assumptions on the

the extreme cases of percolation-like and hopping-like behaviors but that the
intermediate regime has not been previously discussed, in spite of its
relevance to the intensively studied electrical properties of nanocomposites.
Following that we study here the conductivity of dispersions of particle
fillers inside an insulating matrix by taking into account explicitly the
filler particle shapes and the inter-particle electron tunneling process. We
show that the main features of the filler dependencies of the nanocomposite
conductivity can be reproduced without introducing any \textit{a priori}
imposed cut-off in the inter-particle conductances, as usually done in the
percolation-like interpretation of these systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that our numerical results are fully reproduced by the critical path method,
which is generalized here in order to include the particle filler shapes. By
exploiting this method, we provide simple analytical formulas for the composite
conductivity valid for many regimes of interest. The validity of our
formulation is assessed by reinterpreting existing experimental results on
nanotube, nanofiber, nanosheet and nanosphere composites and by extracting the
characteristic tunneling decay length, which is found to be within the expected
range of its values. These results are concluded then to be not only useful for
the understanding of the intermediate regime but also for tailoring the
electrical properties of nanocomposites.

detected using three alternative methods based on current measurements. Besides
being technically easier compared to noise measurements, these methods present
valuable advantages: they do not require the knowledge of the underlying
models, and some are accessible in the experimentally convenient low-voltage
regime, where heating effects are reduced. The first method is based on the AC
conductance, while the two others are based on photo-assisted current (PAC) and
can be implemented for any time-dependence of the tunneling amplitude. These
are promising for edge states in the regime of the fractional quantum Hall
effect (FQHE): the Hamiltonian does not have to be specified and can
incorporate non-universal interactions between the edges, and it is more
convenient to use an AC gate voltage rather than an AC bias. These methods
apply for instance to weak barriers in 1-D systems,
Superconductor-Insulator-Normal (SIN) or graphene-like structures.

lower level sets of suitable functions, called filtering functions, and
encoding the arising information in a parameterized version of the Betti

subsequently generalized to a multidimensional setting, i.e. to the case of
$\R^n$-valued filtering functions, leading to studying the ranks of
multidimensional homology groups. In particular, a multidimensional matching
distance has been defined, in order to compare these ranks. The definition of
the multidimensional matching distance is based on foliating the domain of the
ranks of multidimensional homology groups by a collection of half-planes, and
hence it formally depends on a subset of $\R^n\times\R^n$ inducing a
parameterization of these half-planes. It happens that it is possible to choose
this subset in an infinite number of different ways. In this paper we show that
the multidimensional matching distance is actually invariant with respect to

representations give rise to a non-trivial centre of \Delta_BF^A with respect
to the braiding. This implies that \Delta_BF^A cannot be modular when
non-trival DHR sectors exist. Modular tensor categories, however, are important
for topological quantum computing. For this reason, we discuss a method to
remove this obstruction to modularity.
  Indeed, the obstruction can be removed by passing from the observable net
A(O) to the Doplicher-Roberts field net F(O). It is then shown that sectors of
A can be extended to sectors of the field net that commute with the action of
the corresponding symmetry group. Moreover, all such sectors are extensions of
sectors of A. Finally, the category \Delta_BF^F of sectors of F is studied by
investigating the relation with the categorical crossed product of \Delta_BF^A

completely determines the category \Delta_BF^F.

some of the proposed, next-generation, bolometric experiments. We study the
residual foreground contributions left in the recovered CMB maps in the pixel
and harmonic domain and discuss their impact on a determination of the
tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. In particular, we find that the residuals derived
from the simulated data of the considered balloon-borne observatories are
sufficiently low not to be relevant for the B-mode science. However, the
ground-based observatories are in need of some external information to permit
satisfactory cleaning. We find that if such information is indeed available in
the latter case, both the ground-based and balloon-borne experiments can detect
the values of r as low as ~0.04 at 95% confidence level. The contribution of
the foreground residuals to these limits is found to be then subdominant and
these are driven by the statistical uncertainty due to CMB, including E-to-B
leakage, and noise. We emphasize that reaching such levels will require a
sufficient control of the level of systematic effects present in the data.

one of the most important processes in the evolution of dwarf galaxies. This
interaction results in numerous neutral and ionised gas structures that have
been found both in the disc and in the halo of these galaxies. However, their
origin and fate are still poorly understood. We here present new HI and optical
data of two nearby irregular dwarf galaxies: IC 4662 and NGC 5408. The HI line
data were obtained with the ATCA and are part of the Local Volume HI Survey.
They are complemented by optical images and spectroscopic data obtained with
the ESO NTT and the ESO 3.6m telescope. Our main aim is to study the kinematics
of the neutral and ionised gas components in order to search for outflowing gas
structures and to make predictions about their fate. We find the HI gas
envelopes of both galaxies to extend well beyond the optical discs. The optical
disc is embedded into the central HI maximum in both galaxies. However, higher
resolution HI maps show that the HI intensity peaks are typically offset from
the prominent HII regions. While NGC 5408 shows a fairly regular HI velocity
field, which allows us to derive a rotation curve, IC 4662 reveals a rather
twisted HI velocity field, possibly caused by a recent merger event. We detect
outflows with velocities between 20 and 60 km/s in our Halpha spectra of both
galaxies, sometimes with HI counterparts of similar velocity. We suggest the
existence of expanding superbubbles, especially in NGC 5408. This is also
supported by the detection of FWHMs as high as 70 km/s in Halpha. In case of
NGC 5408, we compare our results with the escape velocity of the galaxy, which
shows that the measured expansion velocities are in all cases too low to allow
the gas to escape from the gravitational potential of NGC 5408. This result is
consistent with studies of other dwarf galaxies.

the positions of people, equipment, etc. GPS technology has proven itself as a
successfull technology for positioning in outdoor environments but indoor no
technology has yet gained a similar wide-scale adoption. A promising indoor
positioning technique is radio-based location fingerprinting, having the major
advantage of exploiting already existing radio infrastructures, like IEEE
802.11, which avoids extra deployment costs and effort. The research goal of
this thesis is to address the limitations of current indoor location
fingerprinting systems. In particular the aim is to advance location
fingerprinting techniques for the challenges of handling heterogeneous clients,
scalability to many clients, and interference between communication and
positioning. The wireless clients used for location fingerprinting are
heterogeneous even when only considering clients for the same technology.
Heterogeneity is a challenge for location fingerprinting because it severely
decreases the precision of location fingerprinting. To support many clients
location fingerprinting has to address how to scale estimate calculation,
measurement distribution, and distribution of position estimates. This is a
challenge because of the number of calculations involved and the frequency of
measurements and position updates. Positioning using location fingerprinting
requires the measurement of, for instance, signal strength for nearby base
stations. However, many wireless communication technologies block communication
while collecting such measurements. This interference is a challenge because it
is not desirable that positioning disables communication. An additional goal is
to improve the conceptual foundation of location fingerprinting. A better
foundation will aid researchers to better survey and design location
fingerprinting systems.

starburst spectrum, which is allowed to gradually evolve into a power law
spectrum (fnu ~ nu^(-0.5)). Multiple simulations were performed with different
times for the onset and dominance of the hard spectrum, with onset redshifts
ranging from z = 3.5 to 5.5. The source is placed in a high-density region to
mimic the expected local environment of a QSO. Simulations with the source
placed in a low-density environment were also performed as control cases to
explore the role of the environment on the properties of the surrounding IGM.
We find in both cases that the IGM temperature within the HeIII region produced
exceeds the IGM temperature before full helium reionization, resulting in a
""thermal proximity effect"", but that the temperature in the HeIII region
increases systematically with distance from the source. With time the
temperature relaxes with a reduced spread as a function of impact parameter
along neighbouring lines of sight, although the trend continues to persist

astronomy, useful to enhance our understanding of the emission mechanisms,
geometry and magnetic field arrangement of many compact objects. However, the
lack of suitable sensitive instrumentation in the X-ray energy band has been
the limiting factor for its development in the last three decades. Up to now,
polarization measurements have been made exclusively with Bragg diffraction at
45 degrees or Compton scattering at 90 degrees and the only unambiguous
detection of X-ray polarization has been obtained for one of the brightest
object in the X-ray sky, the Crab Nebula. Only recently, with the development
of a new class of high sensitivity imaging detectors, the possibility to
exploit the photoemission process to measure the photon polarization has become
a reality. We will report on the performance of an imaging X-ray polarimeter
based on photoelectric effect. The device derives the polarization information
from the track of the photoelectrons imaged by a finely subdivided Gas Pixel
Detector. It has a great sensitivity even with telescopes of modest area and
can perform simultaneously good imaging, moderate spectroscopy and high rate
timing. Being truly 2D it is non-dispersive and does not require any rotation.
This device is included in the scientific payload of many proposals of
satellite mission which have the potential to unveil polarimetry also in X-rays
in a few years.

contemporaneous information about the course of an epidemic at best.
Individuals at the center of a social network are likely to be infected sooner,
on average, than those at the periphery. However, mapping a whole network to
identify central individuals whom to monitor is typically very difficult. We
propose an alternative strategy that does not require ascertainment of global
network structure, namely, monitoring the friends of randomly selected
individuals. Such individuals are known to be more central. To evaluate whether
such a friend group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a flu
outbreak at Harvard College in late 2009. We followed 744 students divided
between a random group and a friend group. Based on clinical diagnoses, the
progression of the epidemic in the friend group occurred 14.7 days (95% C.I.
11.7-17.6) in advance of the randomly chosen group (i.e., the population as a
whole). The friend group also showed a significant lead time (p<0.05) on day 16
of the epidemic, a full 46 days before the peak in daily incidence in the
population as a whole. This sensor method could provide significant additional
time to react to epidemics in small or large populations under surveillance.
Moreover, the method could in principle be generalized to other biological,
psychological, informational, or behavioral contagions that spread in networks.

on the Windmill LFSRs case, used for example in the E0 stream cipher and on
other general applications that use this new representation.
  In a second part, a new design criterion called diffusion delay for LFSRs is
introduced and well compared with existing related notions. This criterion
represents the diffusion capacity of an LFSR. Thus, using the matrices
representation, we present a new algorithm to randomly pick LFSRs with good

hardware and software designs. We present some examples of LFSRs generated

(DFT+U) method that is self-consistent over the choice of Hubbard projectors
used to define the correlated subspaces. In order to overcome the arbitrariness
in this choice, we propose the use of non-orthogonal generalized Wannier
functions (NGWFs) as projectors for the DFT+U correction. We iteratively refine
these NGWF projectors and, hence, the DFT+U functional, such that the
correlated subspaces are fully self-consistent with the DFT+U ground-state. We
discuss the convergence characteristics of this algorithm and compare
ground-state properties thus computed with those calculated using hydrogenic
projectors. Our approach is implemented within, but not restricted to, a
linear-scaling DFT framework, opening the path to DFT+U calculations on systems
of unprecedented size.

we address a similar question, but with respect to a universal generalized

decoding with these metrics (instead of an optimal decoder such as the Maximum

a decoder which is generalized linear and achieves at least 94.2% of the

approach, an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure. The market is assumed
to have access to ""partial"" information about future cash flows. Each cash flow
is determined by a collection of independent market factors called X-factors.
The market filtration is generated by a set of information processes, each of
which carries information about one of the X-factors, and eventually reveals
the X-factor. Each information process has two terms, one of which contains a
""signal"" about the associated X-factor, and the other of which represents
""market noise"". The price of an asset is given by the expectation of the
discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral measure, conditional on the
information provided by the market. When the market noise is modelled by a
Brownian bridge one is able to construct explicit formulae for asset prices, as
well as semi-analytic expressions for the prices and greeks of options and
derivatives. In particular, option price data can be used to determine the
information flow-rate parameters implicit in the definitions of the information
processes. One consequence of the modelling framework is a specific scheme of
stochastic volatility and correlation processes. Instead of imposing a
volatility and correlation model upon the dynamics of a set of assets, one is
able to deduce the dynamics of the volatilities and correlations of the asset
price movements from more primitive assumptions involving the associated cash
flows. The paper concludes with an examination of situations involving
asymmetric information. We present a simple model for informed traders and show
how this can be used as a basis for so-called statistical arbitrage. Finally,
we consider the problem of price formation in a heterogeneous market with
multiple agents.

methods are very efficient at suppressing the speckles, the photometry of the
faint planets is dominated by the speckle residuals. The determination of the
effective temperature and surface gravity of the detected planets from
photometric measurements in different bands is then limited by the photometric
error on the planet flux. In this work we investigate this photometric error
and the consequences on the determination of the physical parameters of the

promised benefit, however, huge feedback overhead is in demand to gather the
channel information. In this paper, we analyze the impact of channel asymmetry,
which is inherent in CoMP systems, on downlink BS cooperative transmission with
limited feedback. We analyze the per-user rate loss of a multi-user CoMP system
led by quantization. Per-cell quantization of multicell channels is considered,
which quantizes the local channel and cross channel separately and is more
feasible in practice. From both the analytical and simulation results, we
provide a whole picture on various critical factors that lead to the
performance loss. Specifically, we show that the per user rate loss led by
limited feedback depends on the location of its paired users, except for
relying on its own signal to noise ratio and the quantization errors as in
single cell multi-user multiple antenna systems. This implies that the
quantization accuracy required for local and cross channel of each user depends
on the locations of its own as well as its paired users.

Shearing the system from an isotropic state, the stress- controlled flow

Pronounced differences when the equilibrium state is nematic. Here, shearing at
controlled $\dot\gamma$ yields several non-equilibrium transitions between
different dynamic states, including chaotic regimes. The corresponding

from tidally disrupted stars. The sudden recoil imparted to the merged black
hole by GW emission promptly fills its loss cone and results in a tidal
disruption rate of stars as high as ~0.1 per year. The prompt disruption of a
star within a single galaxy over a short period provides a unique
electromagnetic flag of a recent black hole coalescence event, and sequential
disruptions could be used on their own to calibrate the expected rate of GW
sources for pulsar timing arrays or the proposed Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (LISA).

by combining it with renormalization group properties in a straightforward
(perturbative) form. This leads to a very transparent and efficient procedure,
with a clear improvement of the non-perturbative results with respect to
previous similar variational approaches. This is illustrated here by deriving
optimized results for the mass gap of the O(2N) Gross-Neveu model, compared
with the exactly know results for arbitrary N. At large N, the exact result is
reproduced already at the very first order of the modified perturbation using
this procedure. For arbitrary values of N, using the original perturbative
information only known at two-loop order, we obtain a controllable percent
accuracy or less, for any N value, as compared with the exactly known result
for the mass gap from the thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz. The procedure is very
general and can be extended straightforwardly to any renormalizable Lagrangian
model, being systematically improvable provided that a knowledge of enough
perturbative orders of the relevant quantities is available.

for 5 objects we present a new analysis of previously published results plus
additional data and for 9 objects we present a new analysis of data already
published. Lightcurves, possible rotation periods and photometric amplitudes
are reported for all of them. The photometric variability is smaller than
previously thought: the mean amplitude of our sample is 0.1mag and only around
15% of our sample has a larger variability than 0.15mag. The smaller
variability than previously thought seems to be a bias of previous
observations. We find a very weak trend of faster spinning objects towards
smaller sizes, which appears to be consistent with the fact that the smaller
objects are more collisionally evolved, but could also be a specific feature of
the Centaurs, the smallest objects in our sample. We also find that the smaller
the objects, the larger their amplitude, which is also consistent with the idea
that small objects are more collisionally evolved and thus more deformed.
Average rotation rates from our work are 7.5h for the whole sample, 7.6h for
the TNOs alone and 7.3h for the Centaurs. All of them appear to be somewhat
faster than what one can derive from a compilation of the scientific literature
and our own results. Maxwellian fits to the rotation rate distribution give
mean values of 7.5h (for the whole sample) and 7.3h (for the TNOs only).
Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium we can determine densities from our sample
under the additional assumption that the lightcurves are dominated by shape
effects, which is likely not realistic. The resulting average density is
0.92g/cm^3 which is not far from the density constraint that one can derive
from the apparent spin barrier that we observe.
