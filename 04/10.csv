of mean force (PMF) obtained from all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations
with a knowledge-based energy function for coarse-grained molecular simulations
in better exploring the energy landscape of a small protein under chemical
interference such as chemical denaturation. An excessive amount of water
molecules in all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations often negatively
impacts the sampling efficiency of some advanced sampling techniques such as
the replica exchange method and it makes the investigation of chemical
interferences on protein dynamics difficult. Thus, there is a need to develop
an effective strategy that focuses on sampling structural changes in protein
conformations rather than solvent molecule fluctuations. In this work, we
address this issue by devising a multiscale simulation scheme (MultiSCAAL) that
bridges the gap between all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulation and
coarse-grained molecular simulation. The two key features of this scheme are
the Boltzmann inversion and a protein atomistic reconstruction method we
previously developed (SCAAL). Using MultiSCAAL, we were able to enhance the
sampling efficiency of proteins solvated by explicit water molecules. Our
method has been tested on the folding energy landscape of a small protein
Trp-cage with explicit solvent under 8M urea using both the all-atomistic
replica exchange molecular dynamics (AA-REMD) and MultiSCAAL. We compared
computational analyses on ensemble conformations of Trp-cage with its available
experimental NOE distances. The analysis demonstrated that conformations
explored by MultiSCAAL better agree with the ones probed in the experiments
because it can effectively capture the changes in side chain orientations that
can flip out of the hydrophobic pocket in the presence of urea and water
molecules.

the classical problem in the operations research field. We prove that BP
converges to the optimal solution in the pseudo-polynomial time, provided that
the optimal solution of the underlying problem is unique and the problem input

which gives a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for
the same problem, which no longer requires the uniqueness of the optimal
solution. This is the first instance where BP is proved to have
fully-polynomial running time. Our results thus provide a theoretical
justification for the viability of BP as an attractive method to solve an

kinematic characteristics (momentum, mass, etc.) and on the jet charged,
neutral and total hadron multiplicities are reported. Up to a scale factor of
about four, which characterizes the overall value of the soft photon excess, a
similarity of the observed soft photon behaviour to that of the inner hadronic

the jet neutral and total hadron multiplicities a prominent difference is found
for the observed soft photon signal as compared to the expected bremsstrahlung
from final state hadrons. The observed linear increase of the soft photon
production rate with the jet total hadron multiplicity and its strong
dependence on the jet neutral multiplicity suggest that the rate is
proportional to the number of quark pairs produced in the fragmentation
process, with the neutral pairs being more effectively radiating than the
charged ones.

above the ionization-equilibrium model. We produce a hardness ratio map to
determine where the plasma is overionized and we perform a spectral analysis of
the regions with and without strong overionization. We find that the
overionized plasma is localized in the center of the remnant and in its western
jet, while it is not detected in the bright eastern jet, where the expansion of
the ejecta is hampered by their interaction with a dense interstellar cloud.
The location of overionized plasma suggests that the inner ejecta are rapidly
cooling by expansion, unlike the outer ejecta, for which expansion is hampered
by interstellar clouds seen in H2

(commonly referenced as ""Arp's loop"") represents one of the most spectacular
feature observed in nearby galaxies. Arp's loop is commonly interpreted as a
tail resulting from the tidal interaction between M81 and M82. However, since
its discovery the nature of this feature has remained controversial. Aims: Our
primary purpose was to identify the sources of optical and infrared emission
observed in Arp's loop. Methods: The morphology of the Arp's loop has been
investigated with deep wide-field optical images. We also measured its colors
using IRAS and Spitzer-MIPS infrared images and compared them with those of the
disk of M81 and Galactic dust cirrus that fills the area where M81 is located.
Results: Optical images reveal that this peculiar object has a filamentary
structure characterized by many dust features overlapping M81's field. The
ratios of far-infrared fluxes and the estimated dust-to-gas ratios indicate the
infrared emission of Arp's loop is dominated by the contribution of cold dust
that is most likely from Galactic cirrus. Conclusions: The above results
suggest that the light observed at optical wavelengths is a combination of
emission from i) a few recent star forming regions located close to M81, where
both bright UV complexes and peaks in the HI distribution are found, ii) the
extended disk of M81 and iii) scattered light from the same Galactic cirrus
that is responsible for the bulk of the far infrared emission.

modeling hyperfine spectral line emission for molecules whose collisional
transitions rates between hyperfine levels are unknown. Hyperfine structure is
seen in the rotational spectra of many commonly observed molecules such as HCN,
HNC, NH3, N2H+, and C17O. The intensities of these spectral lines can be
modeled by numerical techniques such as Lambda-iteration that alternately solve
the equations of statistical equilibrium and the equation of radiative
transfer. However, these calculations require knowledge of both the radiative
and collisional rates for all transitions. For most commonly observed radio
frequency spectral lines, only the net collisional rates between rotational
levels are known. For such cases, two approximate methods have been suggested.
The first method, hyperfine statistical equilibrium (HSE), distributes the
hyperfine level populations according to their statistical weight, but allows
the population of the rotational states to depart from local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE). The second method, the proportional method approximates the
collision rates between the hyperfine levels as fractions of the net rotational
rate apportioned according to the statistical degeneracy of the final hyperfine
levels. The second method is able to model non-LTE hyperfine emission. We
compare simulations of N2H+ hyperfine lines made with approximate and more
exact rates and find that satisfactory results are obtained.

that, for each antenna, the optical paths of the signals from both sources are
similar. However, atmospheric turbulence may introduce strong differences in
the optical paths of the signals and affect, or even waste, phase referencing
for cases of relatively large calibrator-to-target separations and/or bad
weather. The situation is similar in wide-field observations, since the random

essentially the same origin as the random astrometric variations of
phase-referenced sources with respect to the phase center of their calibrators.
In this paper, we present the results of a Monte Carlo study of the astrometric
precision and sensitivity of an interferometric array (a realization of the
Square Kilometre Array, SKA) in phase-referenced and wide-field observations.
These simulations can be extrapolated to other arrays by applying the

atmosphere (i.e., ionosphere and wet component of the troposphere) and also
from the antenna receivers. We study the changes in dynamic range and
astrometric precision as a function of observing frequency, source separation,

GHz, it is possible to obtain images with high fidelity, although the
atmosphere strongly limits the sensitivity of the instrument compared to the
case with no atmosphere. Outside this frequency window, the dynamic range of

been studied. The architecture of the chip and the infrastructure used to
control it were designed to facilitate the implementation of an adiabatic
quantum optimization algorithm. The performance of an eight-qubit unit cell on

fields is a central subject in understanding accretion processes on magnetic
white dwarfs. With XMM-Newton, we perform a spectroscopic and photometric study
of soft X-ray selected polars during their high states of accretion. Aims. On
the basis of X-ray and optical observations of the magnetic cataclysmic
variable AI Tri, we derive the properties of the spectral components, their
flux contributions, and the physical structure of the accretion region in soft
polars. Methods. We use multi-temperature approaches in our xspec modeling of
the spectra to describe the physical conditions and the structures of the
post-shock accretion flow and the accretion spot on the white-dwarf surface. In
addition, we investigate the accretion geometry of the system by a timing
analysis of the photometric data. Results. Flaring soft X-ray emission from the
heated surface of the white dwarf dominates the X-ray flux during roughly 70%
of the binary cycle. This component deviates from a single black body and can
be described by a superimposition of mildly absorbed black bodies with a
Gaussian temperature distribution. In addition, weaker hard X-ray emission is
visible nearly all the time. The spectrum from the cooling post-shock accretion
flow is most closely fitted by a combination of thermal plasma mekal models
with temperature profiles adapted from prior stationary two-fluid hydrodynamic
calculations. The soft X-ray light curves show a dip during the bright phase,
which can be interpreted as self-absorption in the accretion stream.
Phase-resolved spectral modeling supports the picture of one-pole accretion and
self-eclipse. One of the optical light curves corresponds to an irregular mode
of accretion. During a short XMM-Newton observation at the same epoch, the
X-ray emission of the system is clearly dominated by the soft component.

we present the first detection of the dependence of the non-Gaussian halo bias

the halo formation history-dependent contribution to the non-Gaussian halo bias

approximately independent of redshift and halo mass. The correction to the
non-Gaussian halo bias due to the halo formation history can be as large as
100%, with a suppression of the signal for recently formed halos and
enhancement for old halos. This could in principle be a problem for realistic
galaxy surveys if observational selection effects were to pick galaxies
occupying only recently formed halos. Current semi-analytic galaxy formation

several central theorems of quantum information theory. The following chapters
use this theorem to prove the existence of new protocols for two other types of

side information at the transmitter. These protocols also involve sending
quantum information partially known by the receiver with a single use of the

a purely quantum phenomenon called locking. We demonstrate that it is possible
to encode a classical message into a quantum state such that, by removing a
subsystem of logarithmic size with respect to its total size, no measurement
can have significant correlations with the message. The message is therefore
""locked"" by a logarithmic-size key. This thesis presents the first locking
protocol for which the success criterion is that the trace distance between the
joint distribution of the message and the measurement result and the product of
their marginals be sufficiently small.

by the scheme ""the data $\Rightarrow L_0 \Rightarrow \Omega_{L_0} \overset{\rm

origin of the ionized gas in early-type galaxies (ETGs), we analyzed optical
spectra of a sample of 65 ETGs mostly located in low density environments.
Optical emission lines are detected in 89% of the sample. The incidence and
strength of emission do not correlate either with the E/S0 classification, or
with the fast/slow rotator classification. Comparing the nuclear r<r_e/16 line
emission with the classical [OIII]/Hb vs [NII]/Ha diagnostic diagram, the
galaxy activity is so classified: 72% are LINERs, 9% are Seyferts, 12% are
Composite/Transition objects, and 7% are non-classified. Seyferts have young
luminosity-weighted ages (<5 Gyr), and are significantly younger than LINERs
and Composites. Seyferts excluded, the spread in the ([OIII], Ha or [NII])
emission strength increases with the galaxy central velocity dispersion. The
[NII]/Ha ratio decreases with increasing galacto-centric distance, indicating
either a decrease of the nebular metallicity, or a progressive ""softening"" of
the ionizing spectrum. The average oxygen abundance of the ionized gas is
slightly less than solar, and a comparison with the results obtained in Paper
III from Lick indices reveals that it is ~0.2 dex lower than that of stars.
Conclusions: the nuclear emission can be explained with photoionization by PAGB
stars alone only in ~22% of the LINERs/Composite sample. On the other hand, we
can not exclude an important role of PAGB star photoionization at larger radii.
For the major fraction of the sample, the nuclear emission is consistent with
excitation from a low-accretion rate AGN, fast shocks (200 -500 km/s) in a
relatively gas-poor environment (n< 100 cm^-3), or coexistence of the two. The
derived nebular metallicities suggest either an external origin of the gas, or
an overestimate of the oxygen yields by SN models.

have been fully simulated at hadron level including initial and final state
radiation. The study of particle decays was used to develop a method to
distinguish between this Kaluza-Klein model and processes with similar final

detected neutrino fluxes. Then we compute new models of the Sun including a
detailed transport of angular momentum and chemicals due to internal rotation
that includes meridional circulation and shear induced turbulence. We use two
stellar evolution codes: CESAM and STAREVOL to estimate the different terms. We
follow three temporal evolutions of the internal rotation differing by their
initial conditions: very slow, moderate and fast rotation, with magnetic
braking at the arrival on the main sequence for the last two. We find that the
meridional velocity in the present solar radiative zone is extremely small in
comparison with those of the convective zone, smaller than 10^-6 cm/s instead
of m/s. All models lead to a radial differential rotation profile but with a
significantly different contrast. We compare these profiles to the presumed
solar internal rotation and show that if meridional circulation and shear
turbulence were the only mechanisms transporting angular momentum within the
Sun, a rather slow rotation in the young Sun is favored. The transport by
rotation slightly influence the sound speed profile but its potential impact on
the chemicals in the transition region between radiation and convective zones.
This work pushes us to pursue the inclusion of the other dynamical processes to
better reproduce the present observable and to describe the young active Sun.
We also need to get a better knowledge of solar gravity mode splittings to use
their constraints.

stratified compressible self-gravitating polytropic discs in the shearing box
approximation. We study specific dynamics for subadiabatic, adiabatic and
superadiabatic vertical stratifications. In the absence of self-gravity, four
well-known principal modes can be identified in a stratified disc: acoustic p-,
surface gravity f-, buoyancy g- and inertial r-modes. After characterizing
modes in the non-self-gravitating case, we include self-gravity and investigate
how it modifies the properties of these modes. We find that self-gravity, to a
certain degree, reduces their frequencies and changes the structure of the
dispersion curves and eigenfunctions at radial wavelengths comparable to the
disc height. Its influence on the basic branch of the r-mode, in the case of
subadiabatic and adiabatic stratifications, and on the basic branch of the
g-mode, in the case of superadiabatic stratification (which in addition
exhibits convective instability), does appear to be strongest. Reducing the
three-dimensional Toomre's parameter Q_{3D} results in the latter modes
becoming unstable due to self-gravity, so that they determine the onset
criterion and nature of gravitational instability of a stratified disc. By
contrast, the p-, f- and convectively stable g-modes, although their
corresponding \omega^2 are reduced by self-gravity, never become unstable
however small the value of Q_{3D}. This is a consequence of the
three-dimensionality of the disc. The eigenfunctions corresponding to the
gravitationally unstable modes are intrinsically 3D. We also contrast the more
exact instability criterion based on our 3D model with that of density waves in
2D (razor-thin) discs. Based on these findings, we comment on the origin of
surface distortions seen in numerical simulations of self-gravitating discs.

such vulnerability relates to the viral strain as well as to the network
characteristics. For instance, the structure of the network plays an important
role in spreading of epidemics. Additionally, properties of previous epidemic
models require prior knowledge of the complex network structure, which means
the models are limited to only well-known network structures. In this paper, we
propose a new epidemiological SIR model based on the continuous time Markov
chain, which is generalized to any type of network. The new model is capable of
evaluating the states of every individual in the network. Through mathematical
analysis, we prove an epidemic threshold exists below which an epidemic does
not propagate in the network. We also show that the new epidemic threshold is
inversely proportional to the spectral radius of the network. In particular, we
employ the new epidemic model as a novel measure to assess the vulnerability of
networks to the spread of epidemics. The new measure considers all possible
effective infection rates that an epidemic might possess. Next, we apply the
measure to correlated networks to evaluate the vulnerability of disassortative
and assortative scalefree networks. Ultimately, we verify the accuracy of the
theoretical epidemic threshold through extensive numerical simulations. Within
the set of tested networks, the numerical results show that disassortative
scale-free networks are more vulnerable to spreading of epidemics than
assortative scale-free networks.

scenarios. In most of them, the network is composed of a significant number of
nodes deployed in an extensive area in which not all nodes are directly
connected. Then, the data exchange is supported by multihop communications.
Routing protocols are in charge of discovering and maintaining the routes in
the network. However, the correctness of a particular routing protocol mainly
depends on the capabilities of the nodes and on the application requirements.
This paper presents a dynamic discover routing method for communication between
sensor nodes and a base station in WSN. This method tolerates failures of
arbitrary individual nodes in the network (node failure) or a small part of the
network (area failure). Each node in the network does only local routing
preservation, needs to record only its neighbor nodes' information, and incurs
no extra routing overhead during failure free periods. It dynamically discovers
new routes when an intermediate node or a small part of the network in the path
from a sensor node to a base station fails. In our planned method, every node
decides its path based only on local information, such as its parent node and
neighbor nodes' routing information. So, it is possible to form a loop in the
routing path. We believe that the loop problem in sensor network routing is not
as serious as that in the Internet routing or traditional mobile ad-hoc
routing. We are trying to find all possible loops and eliminate the loops as
far as possible in WSN.

bursts (GRBs) could be newly born millisecond magnetars. Therefore, by
considering the spin evolution of the magnetars against r-mode instability, we
investigate the role of the magnetars in GRB X-ray afterglow emission. Besides
modifying the conventional energy injection model, we pay particular attention
to the internal X-ray afterglow emission, whose luminosity is assumed to track
the magnetic dipole luminosity of the magentars with a certain fraction.
Following a comparison between the model and some selected observational
samples, we suggest that some so-called ""canonical"" X-ray afterglows including
the shallow decay, normal decay, and steeper-than-normal decay phases could be
internally produced by the magnetars (possibly through some internal
dissipations of the magnetar winds), while the (energized) external shocks are
associated with another type of X-ray afterglows. If this is true, from those
internal X-ray afterglows, we can further determine the magnetic field
strengths and the initial spin periods of the corresponding magnetars.

Fourier amplitude spectra (AS) made at different heights above the limb are
shown for the first time. A definite signature in the 0.18 to 0.25 Mm range
exists, corresponding to the occurrence of the newly discovered type II
spicules and, even more impressively, large Fourier amplitudes are observed in
the 0.3 to the 1.2 Mm range of diameters and spacing, in rough agreement with
what historical works were reporting. Additionally, some statistically
significant behavior, based on AS computed for different heights above the

behavior of spicules are also analyzed. They show that most of spicules have
multiple structures (similarly to the doublet spicules) and they show
impressive transverse periodic fluctuations which were interpreted as upward
kink or Alfven waves. Evidence of the helical motion in spicules is now well
evidenced, the typical periods of the apparent oscillation being around 120
sec. A fine analysis of the time-slice diagram as a function of the effective
heights shows an interesting new feature near the 2 Mm height. We speculate on
the interpretation of this feature as being a result of the dynamical
specificities of the spicule helical motion as seen in these unprecedented high

introduced to construct a reversible specification from an irreversible
function. In addition, a cycle-based representation model is presented to be
used as an intermediate format in the proposed synthesis methodology. The
selected intermediate format serves as a focal point for all potential
representation models. In order to synthesize a given function, a library
containing seven building blocks is used where each building block is a cycle
of length less than 6. To synthesize large cycles, we also propose a
decomposition algorithm which produces all possible minimal and inequivalent
factorizations for a given cycle of length greater than 5. All decompositions
contain the maximum number of disjoint cycles. The generated decompositions are
used in conjunction with a novel cycle assignment algorithm which is proposed
based on the graph matching problem to select the best possible cycle pairs.
Then, each pair is synthesized by using the available components of the
library. The decomposition algorithm together with the cycle assignment method
are considered as a binding method which selects a building block from the
library for each cycle. Finally, a post-synthesis optimization step is
introduced to optimize the synthesis results in terms of different costs.

115km the solution of the dispersion relation transforms into standard one,
except the situations, when the electron density gradient is parallel to
magnetic field or wave-vector. In these cases the traditionally neglected
summands to the growth rate of the irregularities becomes significant. The
additional terms depend on relative directions of electron density gradient,
magnetic field and mean velocities. This leads to the different instability
growth conditions at equatorial and high-latitude regions of the ionosphere.
The obtained results do not contradict with the experimental data.

data, and spectra of six SNe Ia that were discovered during 2001 are presented.
Additionally, for the two SNe with z>1, we present ground-based J-band
photometry from Gemini and the VLT. These are among the most distant SNe Ia for
which ground based near-IR observations have been obtained. We add these six
SNe Ia together with other data sets that have recently become available in the
literature to the Union compilation (Kowalski et al. 2008). We have made a
number of refinements to the Union analysis chain, the most important ones
being the refitting of all light curves with the SALT2 fitter and an improved
handling of systematic errors. We call this new compilation, consisting of 557
supernovae, the Union2 compilation. The flat concordance LambdaCDM model
remains an excellent fit to the Union2 data with the best fit constant equation
of state parameter w=-0.997^{+0.050}_{-0.054} (stat) ^{+0.077}_{-0.082}

improved constraints on w(z). While no significant change in w with redshift is
detected, there is still considerable room for evolution in w. The strength of
the constraints depend strongly on redshift. In particular, at z > 1, the
existence and nature of dark energy are only weakly constrained by the data.

candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) in the giant molecular cloud M17 SWex,
which extends ~50 pc southwest from the prominent Galactic H II region M17. Our
sample includes >200 YSOs with masses >3 Msun that will become B-type stars on
the main sequence. Extrapolating over the stellar initial mass function (IMF),
we find that M17 SWex contains >1.3x10^4 young stars, representing a proto-OB
association. The YSO mass function is significantly steeper than the Salpeter
IMF, and early O stars are conspicuously absent from M17 SWex. Assuming M17
SWex will form an OB association with a Salpeter IMF, these results reveal the
combined effects of (1) more rapid circumstellar disk evolution in more massive
YSOs and (2) delayed onset of massive star formation.

inert in $K$. Let $K_p$ be the completion of $K$ at $p$. In a previous paper,
we constructed a $p$-adic invariant $u_C\in K_p$, and we proved a $p$-adic
Kronecker limit formula relating $u_C$ to the first derivative at $s=0$ of a
certain $p$-adic zeta function. By analogy with the $p$- adic Gross-Stark
conjectures, we conjectured that $u_C$ is a $p$-unit in a suitable narrow ray
class field of $K$. Recently, Dasgupta has proposed an exact $p$-adic formula
for the Gross-Stark units of an arbitrary totally real number field. In our
special setting, i.e., where one deals with a real quadratic number field, his
construction produces a $p$-adic invariant $u_D\in K_p$ . In this paper we show
precise relationships between the $p$-adic invariants $u_C$ and $u_D$. In order
to do so, we extend Dasgupta's construction of $u_D$ to a broader setting.

connected) bounded domain of R^2, for flows with bounded vorticity, for which
Yudovich proved, in 1963, global existence and uniqueness of the solution. We
prove that if the boundary of the domain is C^infty (respectively Gevrey of
order M > 1) then the trajectories of the fluid particles are C^infty (resp.
Gevrey of order M + 2). Our results also cover the case of ""slightly unbounded""
vorticities for which Yudovich extended his analysis in 1995. Moreover if in
addition the initial vorticity is Holder continuous on a part of the domain
then this Holder regularity propagates smoothly along the flow lines. Finally
we observe that if the vorticity is constant in a neighborhood of the boundary,
the smoothness of the boundary is not necessary for these results to hold.
