Tempering Monte Carlo simulation. Simple approaches to choosing parameter
values can lead to poor equilibration of the simulation, especially for Ising
spin systems that undergo $1^st$-order phase transitions. However, starting
from an initial set of parameter values, the careful, iterative respacing of
these values based on results with the previous set of values greatly improves
equilibration. Example spin systems presented here appear in the context of

surface brightness fluctuation measurements performed on the same data. From
numerical simulations aimed at reproducing the observed dispersion of the value
of the turnover magnitude in each galaxy cluster we estimate an intrinsic

developer community. Hence, it is not always clear whether forking is the right
strategy. In this paper, we describe a mixed-methods exploratory case study

forking of an open-source tool for managing software projects, Trac. Trac was
forked to address differing requirements in an academic setting. The paper
makes two contributions to our understanding of code forking. First, our
exploratory study generated several theories about code forking in open source
projects, for further research. Second, we investigated one of these theories

results have appeared suggesting that not only those objects persist at

suppressed and the resulting clusters in AuAu collisions are larger than in pp
(i.e. in vacuum). This correlates well with recent theoretical scenarios that
view the QCD matter in the $T\approx T_{c}$ region as a dual-magnetic plasma
dominated by color-magnetic monopoles. In this view the flux tubes are
stabilized by dual-magnetic currents and are described by
dual-magnetohydrodynamics (DMHD). In this paper we calculate classically the
dissipative effects in the flux tube. Such effects are associated with
rescattering and finite conductivity of the matter. We derive the DMHD solution

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we study signatures of gravitational
waves (GWs) in the magnetohydrodynamically-driven core-collapse supernovae. In
order to extract the gravitational waveforms, we present a stress formula
including contributions both from magnetic fields and special relativistic
corrections. By changing the precollapse magnetic fields and initial angular
momentum distributions parametrically, we compute twelve models. As for the
microphysics, a realistic equation of state is employed and the neutrino
cooling is taken into account via a multiflavor neutrino leakage scheme.
  With these computations, we find that the total GW amplitudes show a
monotonic increase after bounce for models with a strong precollapse magnetic
field ($10^{12}$G) also with a rapid rotation imposed.
  We show that this trend stems both from the kinetic contribution of MHD
outflows with large radial velocities and also from the magnetic contribution
dominated by the toroidal magnetic fields that predominantly trigger MHD
explosions. For models with weaker initial magnetic fields, the total GW
amplitudes after bounce stay almost zero, because the contribution from the
magnetic fields cancels with the one from the hydrodynamic counterpart.
  These features can be clearly understood with a careful analysis on the
explosion dynamics. We point out that the GW signals with the increasing trend,
possibly visible to the next-generation detectors for a Galactic supernova,
would be associated with MHD explosions with the explosion energies exceeding
$10^{51}$ erg.

cooperatively along the nematic director. Furthermore, we find that the
structural relaxation in equilibrium smectic phases shows interesting
similarities with that of out-of-equilibrium supercooled liquids, although
there the particles are kinetically trapped in transient rather than permanent
cages. Additionally, at fixed packing fraction we find that the barrier height
increases with increasing particle anisotropy, and hence the dynamics is more
heterogeneous and non-Gaussian for longer rods, yielding a lower diffusion
coefficient along the nematic director and smaller clusters of inter-layer
particles that move less cooperatively. At fixed barrier height, the dynamics
becomes more non-Gaussian and heterogeneous for longer rods that move more
collectively giving rise to a higher diffusion coefficient along the nematic
director.

Area Telescope (LAT) instruments on the Fermi satellite. With its wide spectral
bandpass, extending to GeV energies, Fermi is sensitive to GRBs with very large
isotropic energy releases (10e54 erg). Although rare, these events are
particularly important for testing GRB central-engine models. When combined
with spectroscopic redshifts, our afterglow data for these four events are able
to constrain jet collimation angles, the density structure of the circumburst
medium, and both the true radiated energy release and the kinetic energy of the
outflows. In agreement with our earlier work, we find that the relativistic
energy budget of at least one of these events (GRB 090926A) exceeds the
canonical value of 10e51 erg by an order of magnitude. Such energies pose a
severe challenge for models in which the GRB is powered by a magnetar or
neutrino-driven collapsar, but remain compatible with theoretical expectations
for magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) collapsar models. Our jet opening angles
(theta) are similar to those found for pre-Fermi GRBs, but the large initial
Lorentz factors (Gamma_0) inferred from the detection of GeV photons imply
theta Gamma_0 ~ 70-90, values which are above those predicted in MHD models of
jet acceleration. Finally, we find that these Fermi-LAT events preferentially
occur in a low-density circumburst environment, and we speculate that this
might result from the lower mass-loss rates of their lower-metallicity
progenitor stars. Future studies of Fermi-LAT afterglows in the radio with the
order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity offered by the EVLA should
definitively establish the relativistic energy budgets of these events.

and fusing silica capillaries to the bottom of a silica ampoule. The melted
material is then poured into the silica mold to cast the microstructured

spectral transmission window and enable transmission at higher frequencies
compared to the non-porous fibers. We then show that the typical bell-shaped
transmission spectra of the subwavelengths fibers can be very well explained by
the onset of material absorption loss at higher frequencies due to strong
confinement of the modal fields in the material region of the fiber, as well as
strong coupling loss at lower frequencies due to mismatch of the modal field
diameter and a size of the gaussian-like beam of a THz source.

a universal definition of the trispectrum parameter $T_{NL}$, so that the
integrated bispectrum on the observational domain can be consistently compared

decompositions which can be used to describe any primordial or CMB bispectra on
their respective wavenumber or multipole domains. By extracting coefficients of
these separable basis functions from an observational map, we are able to
present an efficient estimator for any given theoretical model with a

theoretical and observed coefficients at either primordial or late times. These
mode decomposition methods are numerically tractable with order $l^5$

associated supernova. We derive the redshift of the event to be z = 0.0591 +/-
0.0001 and provide accurate astrometry for the GRB-SN. We study the extremely
unusual prompt emission with time-resolved gamma-ray to X-ray spectroscopy, and
find that the spectrum is best modelled with a thermal component in addition to
a synchrotron emission component with a low peak energy. The X-ray light curve
has a remarkably shallow decay out to at least 800 s. The host is a bright,
blue galaxy with a highly disturbed morphology and we use Gemini South, VLT and
HST observations to measure some of the basic host galaxy properties. We
compare and contrast the X-ray emission and host galaxy of GRB 100316D to a
subsample of GRB-SNe. GRB 100316D is unlike the majority of GRB-SNe in its
X-ray evolution, but resembles rather GRB 060218, and we find that these two
events have remarkably similar high energy prompt emission properties.
Comparison of the host galaxies of GRB-SNe demonstrates, however, that there is
a great diversity in the environments in which GRB-SNe can be found. GRB
100316D is an important addition to the currently sparse sample of
spectroscopically confirmed GRB-SNe, from which a better understanding of long
GRB progenitors and the GRB--SN connection can be gleaned.

  Convex Operational Models",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the categorical approach to the foundations of quantum theory, one begins
with a symmetric monoidal category, the objects of which represent physical
systems, and the morphisms of which represent physical processes. Usually, this
category is taken to be at least compact closed, and more often, dagger
compact, enforcing a certain self-duality, whereby preparation processes
(roughly, states) are inter-convertible with processes of registration
(roughly, measurement outcomes). This is in contrast to the more concrete
""operational"" approach, in which the states and measurement outcomes associated
with a physical system are represented in terms of what we here call a ""convex
operational model"": a certain dual pair of ordered linear spaces -- generally,
{\em not} isomorphic to one another. On the other hand, state spaces for which
there is such an isomorphism, which we term {\em weakly self-dual}, play an
important role in reconstructions of various quantum-information theoretic
protocols, including teleportation and ensemble steering. In this paper, we
characterize compact closure of symmetric monoidal categories of convex
operational models in two ways: as a statement about the existence of
teleportation protocols, and as the principle that every process allowed by
that theory can be realized as an instance of a remote evaluation protocol ---
hence, as a form of classical probabilistic conditioning. In a large class of
cases, which includes both the classical and quantum cases, the relevant
compact closed categories are degenerate, in the weak sense that every object
is its own dual. We characterize the dagger-compactness of such a category
(with respect to the natural adjoint) in terms of the existence, for each
system, of a {\em symmetric} bipartite state, the associated conditioning map
of which is an isomorphism.

monitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between the
continuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broad
Hbeta emission, which we have previously reported. We present here the light
curves for the Halpha, Hgamma, HeII 4686, and HeI 5876 emission lines and the
time lags for the emission-line responses relative to changes in the continuum
flux. Combining each emission-line time lag with the measured width of the line
in the variable part of the spectrum, we determine a virial mass of the central
supermassive black hole from several independent emission lines. We find that
the masses are generally consistent within the uncertainties. The time-lag
response as a function of velocity across the Balmer line profiles is examined
for six of the AGNs. Finally we compare several trends seen in the dataset
against the predictions from photoionization calculations as presented by
Korista & Goad. We confirm several of their predictions, including an increase
in responsivity and a decrease in the mean time lag as the excitation and
ionization level for the species increases. Further confirmation of
photoionization predictions for broad-line gas behavior will require additional

in an active galactic nucleus (AGN) into the surrounding galaxy occurs via
broad-line winds which must carry mass and radial momentum as well as energy.
The effect can be summarized by the dimensionless parameter
$\eta=dot{M_outflow}/dot{M_accretion}= (2 \epsilon_w c^2)/v_w^2$ where
($\epslion_w \equiv dot{E}_w/(dot{M_accretion} c^2)$) is the efficiency by
which accreted matter is turned into wind energy in the disc surrounding the
central SMBH. The outflowing mass and omentum are proportional to $\eta$, and
many prior treatments have essentially assumed that $\eta=0$. We perform one-
and two-dimensional simulations and find that the growth of the central SMBH is
very sensitive to the inclusion of the mass and momentum driving but is
insensitive to the assumed mechanical efficiency. For example in representative
calculations, the omission of momentum and mass feedback leads to an hundred
fold increase in the mass of the SMBH to over $10^{10} \Msun$. When allowance
is made for momentum driving, the final SMBH mass is much lower and the wind
efficiencies which lead to the most observationally acceptable results are
relatively low with $\epsilon_w \lesssim 10^{-4}$.

energy eigenstates which are metastable against collapse in spite of the strong
attraction, due to their close connection with 1D hard sphere Bose gases which
are highly excited gas-like states. One of these sTG states is a hybrid between
an sTG gas with strong $(\uparrow\downarrow$ attractions and an ideal Fermi gas
with no $(\uparrow\uparrow)$ or $(\downarrow\downarrow)$ interactions, the sTG
component being an exact analog of the recently observed sTG state of a 1D
ultracold Bose gas. It should be possible to create it experimentally by a
sudden switch of the $(\uparrow\downarrow)$ interaction from strongly repulsive
to strongly attractive, as in the recent Innsbruck experiment on the bosonic
sTG gas. The other is a trapped analog of a recently predicted sTG state which
is an ultracold gas of strongly bound $(\uparrow\downarrow)$ fermion dimers
which behave as bosons with a strongly attractive boson-boson interaction
leading to sTG behavior. It is proved that the probability of a transition from
the ground state for strongly repulsive interaction to this dimer state under a

$\ll 1$, contrary to a previous suggestion.

earlier: tracing objects up to redshift $z\sim6$ we find that the formation
time, as characterised by the redshift $z_{1/2}$ at which the halo has
assembled half of its final mass, is gradually shifted from $z_{1/2}\approx
1.83$ in the fiducial LCDM model to $z_{1/2}\approx 2.54$ in the most extreme

marks the transition between merger and steady accretion epochs from
$z_{*}\approx 4.32$ in the \lcdm\ halos to $z_{*}\approx 6.39$ in our strongest

this work produces more structures at high redshifts, prolonging at the same
time the steady accretion phases. These effects taken together can help the
LCDM model to account for a high redshift reionisation as indicated by the WMAP

detected with high confidence as an emitter of high-energy gamma-rays. The
spectrum lacks any evidence for the characteristic cutoff associated with
emission from pulsars, indicating that the emission arises primarily from the
pulsar wind nebula. Broadband modeling implies an evolved nebula with a low
magnetic field resulting in a high gamma-ray to X-ray flux ratio. The Fermi
emission exceeds predictions of the broadband model, and has a steeper
spectrum, possibly resulting from a distinct excess of low energy electrons
similar to what is inferred for both the Vela X and Crab pulsar wind nebulae.

indicates that the lattice pa-rameters increase with Sb content within the

substitution of Sb for As, while the thickness of the Fe2As2 layers increases
significantly, that of the La2O2 layers shrinks simultaneously. So a negative

lowered - corresponding to a vanishing chemical potential. Here we report on
evidence for a thermalised two-dimensional photon gas with freely adjustable

achieved in a photon number-conserving way by photon scattering off the

a confining potential - key prerequisites for the Bose-Einstein condensation of

relatively isolated S0 galaxy, NGC 4382, observed with the Suzaku XIS
instruments and compared the O/Ne/Mg/Fe abundance pattern to those of the ISM
in elliptical galaxies. The derived temperature and Fe abundance in the ISM are
about 0.3 keV and 0.6--2.9 solar, respectively. The abundance ratios are
derived with a better accuracy than the abundances themselves: O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and
Mg/Fe ratios are 0.3, 0.7, and 0.6, respectively, in solar units. The O/Fe
ratio is smaller than that of the ISM in elliptical galaxies, NGC 720, NGC
1399, NGC 1404, and NGC 4636, observed with Suzaku. Since O, Ne, and Mg are
predominantly synthesized by supernovae (SNe) of type II, the observed
abundance pattern indicates that the contribution of SN Ia products is higher
in the S0 galaxy than in the elliptical galaxies Since the hot ISM in
early-type galaxies is an accumulation of stellar mass and SN Ia products, the
low O/Fe ratio in the ISM of NGC 4382 reflects a higher rate of present SNe Ia,
or stars containing more SN Ia products than those in elliptical galaxies.

  extensions of number fields","17 pages",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let p be an odd prime and let L/k be a Galois extension of number fields
whose Galois group is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 2p. Let S be a
finite set of primes of L which is stable under the action of Gal(L/k). The
Lichtenbaum conjecture on special values of the Dedekind zeta function at
negative integers, together with Brauer formalism for Artin's L-functions,
gives a (conjectural) formula relating orders of motivic cohomology groups of
rings of S-integers and higher regulators of S-units of the subextensions of
L/k. In analogy with the classical case of special values at 0, we give an
algebraic proof of this formula, i.e. without using the Lichtenbaum conjecture
nor Brauer formalism. Our method also gives an interpretation of the regulator
term as a higher unit index.

electron-phonon coupling and the influence of magnetism, the experiments yield
important information on low-lying excitations and help to clarify the number

groups converge, the interpretation is still under debate. Here we review the
status of optical investigations on the superconducting state for the 122 and

termination at the zigzag boundary edges have been studied, as well as clusters
disordered by vacancy(s). Density Function Theory and Gaussian03 software were
used to calculate graphene relative stability, desorption energy, band gap,
density of states, surface shape, dipole momentum and electrical polarization
of all clusters by applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functional
Beke-Lee-Yang-Parr. Furthermore, infrared frequencies were calculated for two
of them. Different basis sets, 6-31g**, 6-31g* and 6-31g, depending on the
sizes of clusters are considered to compromise the effect of this selection on
the calculated results. We found that relative stability and the gap decreases
according to the size increase of the graphene cluster. Mulliken charge
variation increase with the size. For about 500 carbon atoms, a zero HOMO-LUMO
gap amount is predicted. Vacancy generally reduces the stability and having
vacancy affects the stability differently according to the location of
vacancies. Surface geometry of each cluster depends on the number of vacancies
and their locations. The energy gap changes as with the location of vacancies
in each cluster. The dipole momentum is dependent on the location of vacancies
with respect to one another. The carbon-carbon length changes according to each
covalence band distance from the boundary and vacancies. Two basis sets, 6-31g*
and 6-31g**, predict equal amount for energy, gap and surface structure, but
charge distribution results are completely different.

analysis reveal the presence of an extended spin-liquid phase near the Kitaev

phases are separated by an unusual stripy antiferromagnetic state, which is the
exact ground state of the model at the midpoint between two limits.

information processings. Here, we propose an approach to entangle a number of
cold ions (individually trapped in a string of microtraps) by a moved cavity.
The cavity is pushed to include the ions one by one with an uniform velocity,
and thus the information stored in former ions could be transferred to the
latter ones by such a moving cavity bus. Since the positions of the trapped
ions are precisely located, the strengths and durations of the ion-cavity
interactions can be exactly controlled. As a consequence, by properly setting
the relevant parameters typical multi-ion entangled states, e.g., $W$ state for
10 ions, could be deterministically generated. The feasibility of the proposal
is also discussed.

shaped institutional econophysics. But in these thoughts about the evolution of
econophysics in the last 15 years we also express some concerns. Our main worry
concerns the relinquishment of the simplicity requirement. Ever since the
groundbreaking experiments of Galileo some three centuries ago, the great
successes of physicists were largely due to the fact that they were able to
decompose complex phenomena into simpler ones. Remember that the first
observation of the effects of an electrical current was made by Alessandro
Volta (1745-1827) on the leg of a frog! Clearly, to make sense this observation
had to be broken down into several separate effects. Nowadays, with computers
being able to handle huge amounts of data and to simulate any stochastic
process no matter how complicated, there is no longer any real need for such a
search for simplicity. Why should one spend time and effort trying to break up
complicated phenomena when it is possible to handle them globally? On this new
road there are several stumbling blocks, however. Do such global mathematical
descriptions lead to a real understanding? Do they produce building blocks
which can be used elsewhere and thus make our knowledge and comprehension to
grow in a cumulative way? Should econophysics also adopt the ""globalized""
perspective that has been endorsed, developed and spread by the numerous
""Complexity Departments"" which sprang up during the last decade?
