model for many applications in thermodynamics, econophysics and sociodynamics.
Despite recent hardware improvements, the solution of the Boltzmann equation
remains extremely challenging from the computational point of view, in
particular by deterministic methods (free of stochastic noise). This work aims
to improve a deterministic direct method recently proposed [V.V. Aristov,
Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2001] for solving the HIBE with a generic
collisional kernel and, in particular, for taking care of the late dynamics of
the relaxation towards the equilibrium. Essentially (a) the original problem is
reformulated in terms of particle kinetic energy (exact particle number and
energy conservation during microscopic collisions) and (b) the computation of
the relaxation rates is improved by the DVM-like correction, where DVM stands
for Discrete Velocity Model (ensuring that the macroscopic conservation laws
are exactly satisfied). Both these corrections make possible to derive very
accurate reference solutions for this test case. Moreover this work aims to
distribute an open-source program (called HOMISBOLTZ), which can be
redistributed and/or modified for dealing with different applications, under
the terms of the GNU General Public License. The program has been purposely
designed in order to be minimal, not only with regards to the reduced number of

Revised version with minor changes",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201014829",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context. Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of large-scale
structure and cosmology. Most commonly, second-order correlations of observed
galaxy ellipticities are expressed as a projection of the matter power
spectrum, corresponding to the lowest-order approximation between the projected
and 3d power spectrum.
  Aims. The dominant lensing-only contribution beyond the zero-order
approximation is the reduced shear, which takes into account not only
lensing-induced distortions but also isotropic magnification of galaxy images.
This involves an integral over the matter bispectrum. We provide a fast and
general way to calculate this correction term.
  Methods. Using a model for the matter bispectrum, we fit elementary functions
to the reduced-shear contribution and its derivatives with respect to
cosmological parameters. The dependence on cosmology is encompassed in a
Taylor-expansion around a fiducial model.
  Results. Within a region in parameter space comprising the WMAP7 68% error
ellipsoid, the total reduced-shear power spectrum (shear plus fitted
reduced-shear correction) is accurate to 1% (2%) for l<10^4 (l<2x10^5). This
corresponds to a factor of four reduction of the bias compared to the case
where no correction is used. This precision is necessary to match the accuracy
of current non-linear power spectrum predictions from numerical simulations.

focused traditionally on stationary gravitational waves: e.g., stochastic or
periodic signals. Gravitational wave bursts --- signals whose duration is much
shorter than the observation period --- will also arise in the pulsar timing
array waveband. Sources that give rise to detectable bursts include the
formation or coalescence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), the periapsis
passage of compact objects in highly elliptic or unbound orbits about a SMBH,
or cusps on cosmic strings. Here we describe how pulsar timing array data may
be analyzed to detect and characterize these bursts. Our analysis addresses, in
a mutually consistent manner, a hierarchy of three questions: \emph{i}) What
are the odds that a dataset includes the signal from a gravitational wave
burst? \emph{ii}) Assuming the presence of a burst, what is the direction to
its source? and \emph{iii}) Assuming the burst propagation direction, what is
the burst waveform's time dependence in each of its polarization states?
Applying our analysis to synthetic data sets we find that we can \emph{detect}
gravitational waves even when the radiation is too weak to either localize the
source of infer the waveform, and \emph{detect} and \emph{localize} sources
even when the radiation amplitude is too weak to permit the waveform to be
determined. While the context of our discussion is gravitational wave detection
via pulsar timing arrays, the analysis itself is directly applicable to
gravitational wave detection using either ground or space-based detector data.

This is achieved in the context of the AdS/CFT duality by constructing the
evolution of the dual geometry in an AdS$_5$ background. Improving the earlier
works in the literature, the two incident nuclei have an impact parameter $b$
and a non-trivial transverse profile. The nuclear matter is modeled by two
shock waves corresponding to a non-zero five dimensional bulk Stress-Energy
Tensor $J_{MN}$. An analytic formula for $T_{\mu \nu}$ at small $\tau$ is
derived and is used in order to calculate the momentum anisotropy and spatial
eccentricity of the medium produced in the collision as a function of the ratio
$\frac{\tau}{b}$. The result for eccentricity at intermediate $\frac{\tau}{b}$
agrees qualitatively with the results obtained in the context of perturbation
theory and by using hydrodynamic simulations. Finally, the problem of the
negative energy density and its natural connection to the eikonal approximation

abstract). The physical nature of the strong photometric variability of T Tau
Sa, the more massive member of the Southern ""infrared companion"" to T Tau, has
long been debated. Intrinsic luminosity variations due to variable accretion
were originally proposed but later challenged in favor of apparent fluctuations
due to time-variable foreground extinction. In this paper we use the timescale
of the variability as a diagnostic for the underlying physical mechanism.
Because the IR emission emerging from Sa is dominantly thermal emission from
circumstellar dust at <=1500K, we can derive a minimum size of the region
responsible for the time-variable emission. In the context of the variable
foreground extinction scenario, this region must be (un-) covered within the
variability timescale, which implies a minimum velocity for the obscuring
foreground material. If this velocity supercedes the local Kepler velocity we
can reject foreground extinction as a valid variability mechanism. The variable
accretion scenario allows for shorter variability timescales since the
variations in luminosity occur on much smaller scales, essentially at the
surface of the star, and the disk surface can react almost instantly on the
changing irradiation with a higher or lower dust temperature and according
brightness. We have detected substantial variations at long wavelengths in T
Tau S: +26% within four days at 12.8 micron. We show that this short-term
variability cannot be due to variable extinction and instead must be due to
variable accretion. Using a radiative transfer model of the Sa disk we show
that variable accretion can in principle also account for the much larger
(several magnitude) variations observed on timescales of several years. For the
long-term variability, however, also variable foreground extinction is a viable
mechanism.

to model the Brownian motion more realistically than the usual one based on the
classical Langevin equation, in that it takes into account also the retarding
effects due to hydrodynamic back-flow, i.e. the added mass and the Basset
memory drag. We provide the analytical expressions of the correlation functions
(both for the random force and the particle velocity) and of the mean squared
particle displacement. The random force has been shown to be represented by a
superposition of the usual white noise with a ""fractional"" noise. The velocity
correlation function is no longer expressed by a simple exponential but
exhibits a slower decay, proportional to t^{-3/2} for long times, which indeed
is more realistic. Finally, the mean squared displacement is shown to maintain,
for sufficiently long times, the linear behaviour which is typical of normal
diffusion, with the same diffusion coefficient of the classical case. However,
the Basset history force induces a retarding effect in the establishing of the
linear behaviour, which in some cases could appear as a manifestation of
anomalous diffusion to be correctly interpreted in experimental measurements.

applications, such as Sigma Delta quantization schemes, employ coarse
quantization coupled with oversampling. The standard mathematical model for the
error accrued from such methods measures the performance of a given scheme by
the rate at which the associated reconstruction error decays as a function of
the oversampling ratio L > 1. It was recently shown that exponential accuracy
of the form O(2(-r L)) can be achieved by appropriate one-bit Sigma Delta
modulation schemes. However, the best known achievable rate constants r in this
setting differ significantly from the general information theoretic lower
bound. In this paper, we provide the first lower bound specific to coarse

In particular, our results imply a quantitative correspondence between the
maximal signal amplitude and the best possible error decay rate. Our method
draws from the theory of large deviations.

(BF) mixture in a double-well potential (DWP). The mixture is described by the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for the bosons, coupled to an equation for the
order parameter of the Fermi superfluid, which is derived from the respective
density functional in the unitarity limit (a similar model applies to the BCS
regime too). Straightforward SSB in the degenerate Fermi gas loaded into a DWP
is impossible, as it requires an attractive self-interaction, while the
intrinsic nonlinearity in the Fermi gas is repulsive. Nonetheless, we
demonstrate that the symmetry breaking is possible in the mixture with
attraction between fermions and bosons, like 40K and 87Rb. Numerical results
are represented by dependencies of asymmetry parameters for both components on
particle numbers of the mixture, N_F and N_B, and by phase diagrams in the
(N_F,N_B) plane, which displays regions of symmetric and asymmetric ground
states. The dynamical picture of the SSB, induced by a gradual transformation
of the single-well potential into the DWP, is reported too. An analytical
approximation is proposed for the case when GPE for the boson wave function may
be treated by means of the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation. Under a special
linear relation between N_F and N_B, the TF approximation allows us to reduce
the model to a single equation for the fermionic function, which includes
competing repulsive and attractive nonlinear terms. The latter one directly
displays the mechanism of the generation of the effective attraction in the

performed systematic measurements of phi meson production in the K+K- decay
channel at midrapidity in p+p, d+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at
sqrt(S_NN)=200 GeV. Results are presented on the phi invariant yield and the
nuclear modification factor R_AA for Au+Au and Cu+Cu, and R_dA for d+Au
collisions, studied as a function of transverse momentum (1<p_T<7 GeV/c) and
centrality. In central and mid-central Au+Au collisions, the R_AA of phi
exhibits a suppression relative to expectations from binary scaled p+p results.
The amount of suppression is smaller than that of the neutral pion and the eta
meson in the intermediate p_T range (2--5 GeV/c); whereas at higher p_T the
phi, pi^0, and eta show similar suppression. The baryon (protons and
anti-protons) excess observed in central Au+Au collisions at intermediate p_T
is not observed for the phi meson despite the similar mass of the proton and
the phi. This suggests that the excess is linked to the number of constituent
quarks rather than the hadron mass. The difference gradually disappears with
decreasing centrality and for peripheral collisions the R_AA values for both
particles are consistent with binary scaling. Cu+Cu collisions show the same
yield and suppression as Au+Au collisions for the same number of N_part. The
R_dA of phi shows no evidence for cold nuclear effects within uncertainties.

depth (47+/-14)ppm and significance 3.5-sigma. We conclude reflected light is a
more plausible origin than thermal emission and determine a geometric albedo of
Ag=(0.38+/-0.12). 2) An eccentric-orbit model for the Neptune-mass planet
Kepler-4b is marginally detected to 2-sigma confidence with e=(0.25+/-0.12). If
confirmed, this would place Kepler-4b in a similar category as GJ436b and
HAT-P-11b as an eccentric, Neptune-mass planet. 3) We find marginal (2-sigma)
evidence for Kepler-5b's secondary eclipse of depth (26+/-17)ppm. The most
plausible explanation is reflected light caused by a planet with
Ag=(0.15+/-0.10). 4) A 2.6-sigma peak in Kepler-6b TTV periodogram is detected

resonant/non-resonant perturber, Trojan or exomoon all provide inadequate

social or information networks is a problem of considerable interest. In
practice, one typically chooses an objective function that captures the
intuition of a network cluster as set of nodes with better internal
connectivity than external connectivity, and then one applies approximation
algorithms or heuristics to extract sets of nodes that are related to the
objective function and that ""look like"" good communities for the application of
interest. In this paper, we explore a range of network community detection
methods in order to compare them and to understand their relative performance
and the systematic biases in the clusters they identify. We evaluate several
common objective functions that are used to formalize the notion of a network
community, and we examine several different classes of approximation algorithms
that aim to optimize such objective functions. In addition, rather than simply
fixing an objective and asking for an approximation to the best cluster of any
size, we consider a size-resolved version of the optimization problem.
Considering community quality as a function of its size provides a much finer
lens with which to examine community detection algorithms, since objective
functions and approximation algorithms often have non-obvious size-dependent
behavior.

explains the complex radio morphology and spectrum by a past passage of the
galaxy and radio bubble through a shock wave. Using analytical solutions to the
full Riemann problem and hydrodynamical simulations, we study how this passage
transformed the plasma bubble into a toroidal vortex ring. Adiabatic
compression of the aged electron population causes it to be energized and to
emit low-surface brightness and steep-spectrum radio emission. The large infall
velocity of NGC 1265 and the low Faraday rotation measure values and variance
of the jet strongly argue that this transformation was due to the accretion
shock onto Perseus situated roughly at R_200. Estimating the volume change of
the radio bubble enables inferring a shock Mach number of M =
4.2_{-1.2}^{+0.8}, a density jump of 3.4_{-0.4}^{+0.2}, a temperature jump of
6.3_{-2.7}^{+2.5}, and a pressure jump of 21.5 +/- 10.5 while allowing for
uncertainties in the equation of state of the radio plasma and volume of the
torus. Extrapolating X-ray profiles, we obtain upper limits on the gas
temperature and density in the infalling warm-hot intergalactic medium of kT <
0.4 keV and n < 5e-5 / cm^3. The orientation of the ellipsoidally shaped radio
torus in combination with the direction of the galaxy's head and tail in the
plane of the sky is impossible to reconcile with projection effects. Instead,
this argues for post-shock shear flows that have been caused by curvature in
the shock surface with a characteristic radius of 850 kpc. The energy density
of the shear flow corresponds to a turbulent-to-thermal energy density of 14%.
The shock-injected vorticity might be important in generating and amplifying
magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. Future LOFAR observations of head-tail
galaxies can be complementary probes of accretion shocks onto galaxy clusters.

The power spectrum approaches have a number of advantages over the traditional
correlation function approach. We test the pseudo spectrum method by using
numerical simulations with square-shape boundary that include masked regions
with complex configuration due to bright stars and saturated spikes. Even when
25% of total area of the survey is masked, the method recovers the E-mode power
spectrum at a sub-percent precision over a wide range of multipoles
100<l<10000. The systematic error is smaller than the statistical errors
expected for a 2000 square degree survey. The residual B-mode spectrum is well
suppressed in the amplitudes at less than a percent level relative to the
E-mode. We also find that the correlated errors of binned power spectra caused
by the survey geometry effects are not significant. Our method is applicable to
the current and upcoming wide-field lensing surveys.

Chandra X-ray Observatory, and AKARI Infrared Astronomy Satellite is presented
for the z=0.036 merging galaxy system II Zw 096 (CGCG 448-020). Because II Zw
096 has an infrared luminosity of log(L_IR/L_sun) = 11.94, it is classified as
a Luminous Infrared Galaxy (LIRG), and was observed as part of the Great
Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). The Spitzer data suggest that 80% of
the total infrared luminosity comes from an extremely compact, red source not
associated with the nuclei of the merging galaxies. The Spitzer mid-infrared
spectra indicate no high-ionization lines from a buried active galactic nucleus
in this source. The strong detection of the 3.3 micron and 6.2 micron PAH
emission features in the AKARI and Spitzer spectra also implies that the energy
source of II Zw 096 is a starburst. Based on Spitzer infrared imaging and AKARI
near-infrared spectroscopy, the star formation rate is estimated to be 120
M_sun/yr and > 45 M_sun/yr, respectively. Finally, the high-resolution B, I,
and H-band images show many star clusters in the interacting system. The colors
of these clusters suggest at least two populations - one with an age of 1-5 Myr
and one with an age of 20-500 Myr, reddened by 0-2 magnitudes of visual
extinction. The masses of these clusters span a range between 10^6-10^8 M_sun.
This starburst source is reminiscent of the extra-nuclear starburst seen in NGC
4038/9 (the Antennae Galaxies) and Arp 299 but approximately an order of
magnitude more luminous than the Antennae. The source is remarkable in that the
off-nuclear infrared luminosity dominates the enitre system.

starbursts with a top-heavy IMF, and the Bower et al. (2006) model, which has
AGN feedback and a standard Solar neighbourhood IMF throughout. We show
predictions for the evolution of the rest-frame far-UV luminosity function in

of LBGs at z=3-10. We find that the Baugh et al. model is in excellent
agreement with these observations, while the Bower et al. model predicts too
many high-luminosity LBGs. Dust extinction, which is predicted
self-consistently based on galaxy gas contents, metallicities and sizes, is
found to have a large effect on LBG luminosities. We compare predictions for
the size evolution of LBGs at different luminosities with observational data
for 2<z<7, and find the Baugh et al. model to be in good agreement. We present
predictions for stellar, halo and gas masses, star formation rates, circular
velocities, bulge-to-disk ratios, gas and stellar metallicities and clustering
bias, as functions of far-UV luminosity and redshift. We find broad consistency
with current observational constraints. We then present predictions for the
abundance and angular sizes of LBGs out to very high redshift (z<20), finding
that planned deep surveys with JWST should detect objects out to z<15. The
typical UV luminosities of galaxies are predicted to be very low at high
redshifts, which has implications for detecting the galaxies responsible for
reionizing the IGM; for example, at z=10, 50% of the ionizing photons are

which is at z = 0.3877. The lensed galaxy exhibits a rich spectrum with broad
interstellar absorption lines and a wealth of nebular emission lines.
Preliminary analysis of these features shows the galaxy to be young, with an
age of 25-50 Myr. With a star-formation rate of approximately 20 solar
masses/yr, the galaxy has already assembled a stellar mass of 3 x 10^9 solar
masses and reached half-solar metallicity. Its blue spectral energy

extinction. A more in-depth analysis of the properties of this system is
currently hampered by the lack of a viable lensing model. However, it is
already clear that CSWA5 shares many of its physical characteristics with the

further study of both the source and the foreground mass concentration

we observe that the chance that a voter will support a candidate is strongly

powerful observable of future redshift surveys to probe physical properties of
dark energy and to distinguish among gravity theories. We investigate
systematic effects on determination of the growth factor f from a measurement
of redshift-space distortions. Using N-body simulations we identify dark matter
halos over a broad mass range. We compute the power spectra and correlation
functions for the halos and then examine how well the redshift distortion
parameter beta=f/b can be reconstructed as a function of halo mass. We find
that beta measured for a fixed halo mass is generally a function of scale even
on large scales, in contrast with the common expectation that beta approaches a
constant described by Kaiser's formula on such scales. The scale dependence
depends on the halo mass, being stronger for smaller halos. It also cannot be
easily explained with the well-known distribution function of the halo peculiar
velocities. We demonstrate that the biasing for smaller halos has larger
nonlinearity and stochasticity, thus the linear bias assumption becomes worse
for smaller halos. Only for massive halos with b>1.5, beta approaches the
linear theory prediction on scales of r or pi/k>30Mpc/h. Luminous red galaxies
(LRG), targeted by the SDSS-III's BOSS survey, tend to reside in very massive
halos. Our results indicate that if the LRG is used for the measurement of
redshift distortions, f can be measured unbiasedly. On the other hand, if one
considers to use emission line galaxies, which are targeted by the BigBOSS
survey and inhabited in halos of a broad mass range, the scale dependence of
beta must be taken into account carefully; otherwise one might give incorrect
constraints on dark energy or modified gravity theories. We also find that beta
reconstructed in Fourier space behaves better than that in configuration space.

and the coupling of the extra degrees of freedom to the moduli, but it is
independent of the moduli's potential if the dimensionality of the field space
is considerably larger than the dimensionality of the loci, D >> d. Once the
terminal velocity is approached, particles are produced at a plethora of nearby
ESLs, preventing a further increase in speed via their backreaction. It is
possible to drive inflation at the terminal velocity, providing a
generalization of trapped inflation with attractive features: we find that more
than sixty e-folds of inflation for sub-Planckian excursions in field space are
possible if ESLs are ubiquitous, without fine tuning of initial conditions and
less tuned potentials. We construct a simple, observationally viable model with
a slightly red scalar power-spectrum and suppressed gravitational waves; we
comment on the presence of additional observational signatures originating from
IR-cascading and individual massive particles. We also show that
moduli-trapping at an ESL is suppressed for D >> d, hindering dynamical
selection of high-symmetry vacua on the landscape based on this mechanism.

axions, an Axiverse, is evidence for the extra dimensions of string theory. We
discuss the observational consequences of these axions on astrophysical black
holes through the Penrose superradiance process. When an axion Compton
wavelength is comparable to the size of a black hole, the axion binds to the
black hole ""nucleus"" forming a gravitational atom in the sky. The occupation
number of superradiant atomic levels, fed by the energy and angular momentum of
the black hole, grows exponentially. The black hole spins down and an axion
Bose-Einstein condensate cloud forms around it. When the attractive axion
self-interactions become stronger than the gravitational binding energy, the
axion cloud collapses, a phenomenon known in condensed matter physics as
""Bosenova"". The existence of axions is first diagnosed by gaps in the mass vs
spin plot of astrophysical black holes. For young black holes the allowed
values of spin are quantized, giving rise to ""Regge trajectories"" inside the
gap region. The axion cloud can also be observed directly either through
precision mapping of the near horizon geometry or through gravitational waves
coming from the Bosenova explosion, as well as axion transitions and
annihilations in the gravitational atom. Our estimates suggest that these
signals are detectable in upcoming experiments, such as Advanced LIGO, AGIS,
and LISA. Current black hole spin measurements imply an upper bound on the QCD
axion decay constant of 2 x 10^17 GeV, while Advanced LIGO can detect signals
from a QCD axion cloud with a decay constant as low as the GUT scale. We
finally discuss the possibility of observing the gamma-rays associated with the
Bosenova explosion and, perhaps, the radio waves from axion-to-photon
conversion for the QCD axion.

energy into excitation of other matter fields. I focus on preheating in chaotic
inflation models, which proceeds via broad parametric resonance. I describe a

large-scale structure. Lensing introduces magnification with a probability
distribution function (PDF) whose shape is highly skewed and depends on
cosmological parameters. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to generate mock
samples of standard sirens, including a small intrinsic scatter, as well as the
additional, larger scatter from lensing, in their inferred distances. We derive
constraints on cosmological parameters, by simultaneously fitting the mean and
the distribution of the residuals on the distance vs redshift (d_L - z) Hubble
diagram. We find that for standard sirens at redshift z ~ 1, the sensitivity to
a single cosmological parameter, such as the matter density Omega_m, or the
dark energy equation of state w, is ~ 50%-80% tighter when the skewed lensing
PDF is used, compared to the sensitivity derived from a Gaussian PDF with the
same variance. When these two parameters are constrained simultaneously, the
skewness yields a further enhanced improvement (by ~ 120%), owing to the
correlation between the parameters. The sensitivity to the amplitude of the
matter power spectrum, sigma_8 from the cosmological dependence of the PDF
alone, however, is ~ 20% worse than that from the Gaussian PDF. At higher
redshifts, the PDF resembles a Gaussian more closely, and the effects of the
skewness become less prominent. These results highlight the importance of
obtaining an accurate and reliable PDF of the lensing convergence, in order to
realize the full potential of standard sirens as cosmological probes.

all items have the same significance without taking their weight into account.
It also ignores the difference between the transactions and importance of each

work on databases with only binary attributes. It makes use of the importance
of each itemset and transaction. WARM requires each item to be given weight to
reflect their importance to the user. The weights may correspond to special
promotions on some products, or the profitability of different items. This
research work first focused on a weight assignment based on a directed graph
where nodes denote items and links represent association rules. A generalized
version of HITS is applied to the graph to rank the items, where all nodes and
links are allowed to have weights. This research then uses enhanced HITS
algorithm by developing an online eigenvector calculation method that can
compute the results of mutual reinforcement voting in case of frequent updates.
For Example in Share Market Shares price may go down or up. So we need to
carefully watch the market and our association rule mining has to produce the
items that have undergone frequent changes. These are done by estimating the
upper bound of perturbation and postponing of the updates whenever possible.
Next we prove that enhanced algorithm is more efficient than the original HITS
under the context of dynamic data.

is based on data gathered in 2006 by the Whole Earth Telescope (WET); this data
set was multiperiodic, containing at least 12 individual modes. Our second fit
utilizes data obtained in 1996, when GD 358 underwent a dramatic change in
excited frequencies accompanied by a rapid increase in fractional amplitude;
during this event it was essentially monoperiodic. We argue that GD 358's
convection zone was much thinner in 1996 than in 2006, and we interpret this as
a result of a short-lived increase in its surface temperature. In addition, we
find strong evidence of oblique pulsation using two sets of evenly split
triplets in the 2006 data. This marks the first time that oblique pulsation has
been identified in a variable white dwarf star.

spectra. The low background and relatively sharp spectral resolution of the
Suzaku XIS detectors, combined with the high luminosity and temperature in NGC

encompasses O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, and Ni in both regions. We apply
simple chemical evolution models to these data, and conclude that the

stellar mass loss and direct injection of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) ejecta. We
thus confirm the inference, based on optical data, that the stars in elliptical
galaxies have supersolar alpha/Fe ratios, but find that that the present-day
SNIa rate is 4-6 times lower than the standard value. We find SNIa yield sets
that reproduce Ca and Ar, or Ni, but not all three simultaneously. The low

at VLT+UVES in order to study the evolution, origin and abundances of the
heavy-element absorption system recently discovered in 80% of classical novae
in outburst. The early decline of Nova Scorpii 2008 was monitored with high
resolution echelle spectroscopy at 5 different epochs. The analysis of the
absorption and the emission lines show many unusual characteristics. Nova
Scorpii 2008 is confirmed to differ from a common Classical Nova as well as a
Symbiotic Recurrent Nova, and it shows characteristics which are common to the
so called, yet debated, red-novae. The origin of this new nova remains
uncertain.

problems in physics and astrophysics. Observations of double-neutron-star
binary systems have given the first observational evidence for the existence of
gravitational waves (GWs) and shown that Einstein's general theory of
relativity is an accurate description of gravitational interactions in the
regime of strong gravity. Observations of a large sample of pulsars spread
across the celestial sphere forming a ""Pulsar Timing Array"" (PTA), can in
principle enable a positive detection of the GW background in the Galaxy. The
Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) is making precise timing measurements of 20
millisecond pulsars at three radio frequencies and is approaching the level of
timing precision and data spans which are needed for GW detection. These
observations will also allow us to establish a ""Pulsar Timescale"" and to detect
or limit errors in the Solar System ephemerides used in pulsar timing analyses.
Combination of PPTA data with that of other groups to form an International
Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) will enhance the sensitivity to GWs and facilitate
reaching other PTA goals. The principal source of GWs at the nanoHertz
frequencies to which PTAs are sensitive is believed to be super-massive binary
black holes in the cores of distant galaxies. Current results do not
signficantly limit models for formation of such black-hole binary systems, but
in a few years we expect that PTAs will either detect GWs or seriously
constrain current ideas about black-hole formation and galaxy mergers. Future
instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) should not only detect GWs
from astrophysical sources but also enable detailed studies of the sources and
the gravitational theories used to account for the GW emission.

massive asteroids in the main belt, Ceres and Vesta. This double-rendezvous
mission is enabled by the use of low-thrust solar electric propulsion. Dawn
will arrive at Vesta in 2011 and will operate in its vicinity for approximately
one year. Vesta's mass and non-spherical shape, coupled with its rotational
period, presents very interesting challenges to a spacecraft that depends
principally upon low-thrust propulsion for trajectory-changing maneuvers. The
details of Vesta's high-order gravitational terms will not be determined until
after Dawn's arrival at Vesta, but it is clear that their effect on Dawn
operations creates the most complex operational environment for a NASA mission
to date. Gravitational perturbations give rise to oscillations in Dawn's
orbital radius, and it is found that trapping of the spacecraft is possible
near the 1:1 resonance between Dawn's orbital period and Vesta's rotational
period, located approximately between 520 and 580 km orbital radius.This
resonant trapping can be escaped by thrusting at the appropriate orbital phase.
Having passed through the 1:1 resonance, gravitational perturbations ultimately
limit the minimum radius for low-altitude operations to about 400 km,in order
to safely prevent surface impact. The lowest practical orbit is desirable in
order to maximize signal-to-noise and spatial resolution of the Gamma-Ray and
Neutron Detector and to provide the highest spatial resolution observations by
Dawn's Framing Camera and Visible InfraRed mapping spectrometer. Dawn dynamical
behavior is modeled in the context of a wide range of Vesta gravity models.
Many of these models are distinguishable during Dawn's High Altitude Mapping
Orbit and the remainder are resolved during Dawn's Low Altitude Mapping Orbit,
providing insight into Vesta's interior structure.

then anisotropic selection effects such as preferential selection of face-on
disc galaxies can contaminate large scale structure observables. Here we
consider the effect on the galaxy bispectrum, which has attracted interest as a
way to break the degeneracy between galaxy bias and the amplitude of matter
fluctuations sigma_8. We consider two models of intrinsic galaxy alignments:
one where the probability distribution for the galaxy's orientation contains a
term linear in the local tidal field, appropriate for elliptical galaxies; and
one with a term quadratic in the local tidal field, which may be applicable to
disc galaxies. We compute the correction to the redshift-space bispectrum in
the quasilinear regime, and then focus on its effects on parameter constraints
from the transverse bispectrum, i.e. using triangles in the plane of the sky.
We show that in the linear alignment model, intrinsic alignments result in an
error in the galaxy bias parameters, but do not affect the inferred value of
sigma_8. In contrast, the quadratic alignment model results in a systematic
error in both the bias parameters and sigma_8. However, the quadratic alignment
effect has a unique configuration dependence that should enable it to be
removed in upcoming surveys.

galaxies, are known to house a massive black hole at their center rather than a

in the hierarchical merger scenario, then one needs to explain why their dense
nuclear star clusters are not preserved in merger events. A valuable clue may
the recent revelation that nuclear star clusters and massive black holes
frequently co-exist in intermediate mass bulges and elliptical galaxies. In an
effort to understand the physical mechanism responsible for the disappearance
of nuclear star clusters, we have numerically investigated the evolution of
merging star clusters with seed black holes. Using black holes that are 1-5% of
their host nuclear cluster mass, we reveal how their binary coalescence during
a merger dynamically heats the newly wed star cluster, expanding it,
significantly lowering its central stellar density, and thus making it
susceptible to tidal destruction during galaxy merging. Moreover, this
mechanism provides a pathway to explain the observed reduction in the
nucleus-to-galaxy stellar mass ratio as one proceeds from dwarf to giant
elliptical galaxies.

procedure, we find that mean-field variables in the iteration diverge due to
improper normalization factor of regularization terms appearing in the
posterior. To avoid this difficulty, we rescale the regularization term by
introducing a scaling factor and optimizing it by means of minimization of the
mean-square error. We confirm that the optimal scaling factor stabilizes the
mean-field iterative process of the motion velocity estimation. We next attempt
to estimate the optimal values of hyper-parameters including the regularization
term, which define our probabilistic model macroscopically, by using the
Boltzmann-machine type learning algorithm based on gradient descent of marginal
likelihood (type-II likelihood) with respect to the hyper-parameters. In our
framework, one can estimate both the probabilistic model (hyper-parameters) and
motion velocity fields simultaneously. We find that our motion estimation is
much better than the result obtained by Zhang and Hanouer (1995) in which the
hyper-parameters are set to some ad-hoc values without any theoretical

bidding is somehow harder than simply computing the allocation. We show that
the opposite is true: creating a randomized truthful mechanism is essentially
as easy as a single call to a monotone allocation rule. Our main result is a
general procedure to take a monotone allocation rule for a single-parameter
domain and transform it (via a black-box reduction) into a randomized mechanism
that is truthful in expectation and individually rational for every
realization. The mechanism implements the same outcome as the original
allocation rule with probability arbitrarily close to 1, and requires
evaluating that allocation rule only once. We also provide an extension of this
result to multi-parameter domains and cycle-monotone allocation rules, under
mild star-convexity and non-negativity hypotheses on the type space and
allocation rule, respectively.
  Because our reduction is simple, versatile, and general, it has many
applications to mechanism design problems in which re-evaluating the allocation
rule is either burdensome or informationally impossible. Applying our result to
the multi-armed bandit problem, we obtain truthful randomized mechanisms whose
regret matches the information-theoretic lower bound up to logarithmic factors,
even though prior work showed this is impossible for truthful deterministic
mechanisms. We also present applications to offline mechanism design, showing
that randomization can circumvent a communication complexity lower bound for
deterministic payments computation, and that it can also be used to create
truthful shortest path auctions that approximate the welfare of the VCG
allocation arbitrarily well, while having the same running time complexity as
Dijkstra's algorithm.

with the E-type antiferromagnetic spin ordering or not remains as one of
unresolved, challenging issues in the physics of multiferroics. The issue is
closely linked to an intriguing experimental difficulty for determining P of
polycrystalline specimens that conventional pyroelectric current measurements
performed after a poling procedure under high dc electric fields are subject to
large errors due to the problems caused by leakage currents or space charges.
To overcome the difficulty, we employed the PUND method, which uses
successively the two positive and two negative electrical pulses, to directly
measure electrical hysteresis loops in several polycrystalline HoMnO3 specimens
below their N\'eel temperatures. We found that all the HoMnO3 samples had
similar remnant polarization Pr values at each temperature, regardless of their
variations in resistivity, dielectric constant, and pyroelectric current
levels. Moreover, Pr of ~0.07 \mu\C/cm2 at 6 K is consistent with the P value
obtained from the pyroelectric current measurement performed after a short
pulse poling. Our findings suggest that intrinsic P of polycrystalline HoMnO3
can be determined through the PUND method and P at 0 K may reach ~0.24
\mu\C/cm2 in a single crystalline specimen.

evolution in time is performed via the Kadanoff-Baym Equations (KBE) within
Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT). The main property we analyze is the
time-dependent density. We also study is the exchange-correlation potential of
TDDFT, obtained via reverse engineering from the time-dependent density. Our
systems consist of small, strongly correlated clusters, described by a Hubbard
Hamiltonian within the Hartree-Fock, second Born, GW and T-matrix
approximations. We compare the results from the KBE dynamics to those from
exact numerical solutions. The outcome of our comparisons is that, among the
many-body schemes considered, the T-matrix approximation is overall superior at
all electron densities. Such comparisons permit a general assessment of the
whole idea of applying MBPT, in the KBE sense, to finite systems. A striking
outcome of our analysis is that when the system evolves under a strong external
field, the KBE develop a steady-state solution as a consequence of a
correlation-induced damping. This damping is present both in isolated (finite)
systems, where it is purely artificial, as well as in clusters contacted to
(infinite) macroscopic leads. To illustrate this point we present selected
results for a system coupled to contacts within the T-matrix and second Born
approximation. The extensive characterization we performed indicates that this
behavior is present whenever approximate self energies, based upon infinite
partial summations, are used. A second important result is that, for isolated
clusters, the steady state reached is not unique but depends on how one
switches on the external field. This may also true for clusters connected to
leads.

hydrodynamic memory leads to an algebraic decay. The long-time behavior for the
motion parallel and perpendicular to the wall is derived analytically and
compared to numerical results. Then, we discuss the power spectral densities of

for low-energy strong interactions, and the Einstein-Hilbert action. We use
these analogies to suggest a specific mechanism whereby gravitons would emerge
as Goldstone bosons of a global SO(D) X GL(D) symmetry broken down to SO(D) by
fermion condensation. We propose a two-dimensional toy model where a dynamical
zwei-bein is generated from a topological theory without any pre-existing
metric structure, the space being endowed only with an affine connection. A
metric appears only after the symmetry breaking; thus the notion of distance is
an induced effective one. In spite of several non-standard features this simple
toy model appears to be renormalizable and at long distances is described by an
effective lagrangian that corresponds to that of two-dimensional gravity
(Liouville theory). The induced cosmological constant is related to the
dynamical mass M acquired by the fermion fields in the breaking, which also
acts as an infrared regulator. The low-energy expansion is valid for momenta k
>M, i.e. for supra-horizon scales. We briefly discuss a possible implementation
of a similar mechanism in four dimensions.

the gamma-rays to the radio band. Substantial observational efforts have been
devoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. the
initial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.
In spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are still
several open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, their
energetics and the environment. Aim: Independently of specific gamma-ray burst
theoretical recipes, spectra in the GeV/TeV range are predicted to be
remarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and therefore
offer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background light
distribution. Furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-high
energies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,GeV, would solve the ambiguity about the
importance of various possible emission processes, which provide barely
distinguishable scenarios at lower energies. Methods: We used the results of
the MAGIC telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)
\object{GRB\,080430} at energies above about 80\,GeV, to evaluate the
perspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based GeV/TeV
telescopes. Results: We obtained an upper limit of $F_{\rm 95%\,CL} = 5.5
\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of
\object{GRB\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoretical
scenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling the
low-energy afterglow. Nonetheless, our observations show that Cherenkov
telescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the GeV/TeV
emission of GRBs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided the
observations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of their
afterglow phase.

determination of the shower to shower fluctuations is hampered by the
artificial fluctuations induced by the thinning procedure. However, we show
that shower to shower fluctuations can still be approximately estimated, and we

relationship between path statistics and Quantum Mechanics (QM) leads to two
canonical ways of defining random walk on a graph, which have different
statistics and hence different entropies. Generic random walk (GRW) is in
correspondence with the field-theoretical formalism, whereas maximal entropy
random walk (MERW), introduced by us in a recent work, is motivated by the
Feynman path-integral formulation of QM. GRW maximizes entropy locally
(neighbors are chosen with equal probabilities), in contrast to MERW which does
so globally (all paths of given length and endpoints are equally probable). The
stationary distribution for MERW is given by the ground state of a
quantum-mechanical problem where nodes whose degree is smaller than average act
as repulsive impurities. We investigate static and dynamical properties GRW and
MERW in a variety of examples in one and two dimensions. The most spectacular
difference arises in the case of weakly diluted lattices, where a particle
performing MERW gets eventually trapped in the largest nearly spherical region
which is free of impurities. We put forward a quantitative explanation of this
localization effect in terms of a classical Lifshitz phenomenon.

associated impurity problem is solved using the numerical renormalization group
method. The transition is found to occur when electron-electron coupling
strength $U$ and the induced interaction $\lambda$ due to electron-phonon

transition for small coupling and large $\omega_0$, and a discontinuous one for
large coupling and/or small $\omega_0$. We present results for the order
parameters, the static expectation values for the electrons and phonons, and
the corresponding spectral functions. They illustrate the different types of

electronic properties of this material. Here we investigate spatial ordering of
adatoms driven by the RKKY-type interactions. In the ordered state, which
arises via a Peierls-instability-type mechanism, the adatoms reside mainly on
one of the two graphene sublattices. Bragg scattering of electron waves induced
by sublattice symmetry breaking results in a band gap opening, whereby Dirac
fermions acquire a finite mass. The band gap is found to be immune to the
adatoms' positional disorder, with only an exponentially small number of
localized states residing in the gap. The gapped state is stabilized in a wide
range of electron doping. Our findings show that controlled adsorption of
adatoms or molecules provides a route to engineering a tunable band gap in
graphene.

with antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlation, both the CO and AFM correlations
collapse rapidly, and appearances of new peaks inside of an insulating gap are
observed in the optical spectra and the one-particle excitation spectra. Time
evolutions of the spin correlation and the in-gap state are correlated with
each other, and are governed by the transfer integral of conduction electrons.
Results are interpreted by the charge kink/anti-kink picture and their
effective motions which depend on the localized spin correlation. Pump-photon
density dependence of spin and charge dynamics are also studied. Roles of spin
degree of freedom are remarkable in a case of weak photon density. Implications
of the numerical results for the pump-probe experiments in perovskite

as low as those of the HII regions in LSBGs studied in literature, which could
be because our samples are more luminous, and because of the different

process, methanol masers have gained increasing importance. The
phenomenological distinction between Class I and II methanol masers is based on
their spatial association with objects such as jets, cores, and ultracompact
HII regions, but is also believed to correspond to different pumping
mechanisms: radiation for Class II masers, collisions for Class I masers. In
this work, we have surveyed a large sample of massive star forming regions -
296 objects divided into two groups named 'High' and 'Low' according to their
[25-12] and [60-12] IRAS colours - in Class I and II methanol masers. Previous
studies indicate that the High sources are likely more evolved. Therefore, the
sample can be used to assess the existence of a sequence for the occurrence of
Class I and II methanol masers during the evolution of a massive star forming
region. We observed the 6 GHz (Class II) CH3OH maser with the Effelsberg 100-m
telescope, and the 44 GHz and 95 GHz (Class I) CH3OH masers with the Nobeyama
45-m telescope. We have detected: 55 sources in the Class II line (12 new
detections); 27 sources in the 44 GHz Class I line (17 new detections); 11
sources in the 95 GHz Class I line (all except one are new detections). Our
statistical analysis shows that the ratio between the detection rates of Class
II and Class I methanol masers is basically the same in High and Low sources.
Therefore, both masers are equally associated with each evolutionary phase. In
contrast, all maser species have about 3 times higher detection rates in High
than in Low sources. This might indicate that the phenomena that originate all
masers become progressively more active with time, during the earliest
evolutionary phases of a high-mass star forming region.

parametrizes k-isomorphism classes of Lam\'e covers, which are tamely ramified
covers of the projective line unramified outside three points having a
particular ramification datum. This fact is surprising for two reasons: first
of all, it is the first non-trivial example of a family of covers of the
projective line unramified outside three points which is parametrized by the
geometric points of a curve. Moreover, when considered in arbitrary
characteristic, the explicit construction of Lam\'e covers is quite involved
and their arithmetic properties still remain misterious. The simplicity of the
problem in characteristic 2 has many deep consequences when combined with
lifting techniques from positive characteristic to characteristic 0. As an
illustration, we obtain some sharp statements concerning the (local) Galois
action, as, for example, a bound on the number of isomorphism classes of Lam\'e
covers defined over a fixed number field, only depending on the degree of the
residual extension at 2. Finally, in the appendix we give a partial

the k-rational points of a suitable quotient of a genus g hyperelliptic curve
parametrize k-isomorphism classes of tamely ramified covers of the projective

approach introduces its own biases, in the form of a priori knowledge about the
shape of Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF) and task-related signal changes,
or about the subject behaviour during the task. In this paper, we introduce a
data-driven version of the spectral clustering parcellation, based on
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) instead of
the GLM. First, a number of independent components are automatically selected.
Seed voxels are then obtained from the associated ICA maps and we compute the
PLS latent variables between the fMRI signal of the seed voxels (which covers
regional variations of the HRF) and the principal components of the signal
across all voxels. Finally, we parcellate all subjects data with a spectral
clustering of the PLS latent variables. We present results of the application
of the proposed method on both single-subject and multi-subject fMRI datasets.
Preliminary experimental results, evaluated with intra-parcel variance of GLM
t-values and PLS derived t-values, indicate that this data-driven approach
offers improvement in terms of parcellation accuracy over GLM based techniques.

multi-hop wireless networks. Potential source-destination paths are dynamically
selected from a pool of randomly located relays, from which a closed-form lower
bound on the outage probability is derived in terms of the expected number of
potential paths. This is in turn used to provide an upper bound on the number
of successful transmissions that can occur per unit area, which is known as the
transmission capacity. The upper bound results from assuming independence among
the potential paths, and can be viewed as the maximum diversity case. A useful
aspect of the upper bound is its simple form for an arbitrary-sized network,
which allows insights into how the number of hops and other network parameters
affect spatial throughput in the non-asymptotic regime. The outage probability
analysis is then extended to account for retransmissions with a maximum number
of allowed attempts. In contrast to prevailing wisdom, we show that
predetermined routing (such as nearest-neighbor) is suboptimal, since more hops
are not useful once the network is interference-limited. Our results also make
clear that randomness in the location of relay sets and dynamically varying
channel states is helpful in obtaining higher aggregate throughput, and that
dynamic route selection should be used to exploit path diversity.

by the addition of extra vacuum energy that is present during inflation but
disappears afterwards. We show that in such a case, the required amount of fine
tuning is greatly reduced. We suggest that the extra vacuum energy can be
associated with an earlier phase transition and provide a simple model, based
on extending the SM gauge group to SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y\times
U(1)_{B-L}, where the Higgs field of U(1)_{B-L} is in a false vacuum during
inflation. In this case, there is virtually no fine tuning of the soft SUSY
breaking parameters of the flat direction which serves as the inflaton.
However, the absence of radiative corrections which would spoil the flatness of
the inflaton potential requires that the U(1)_{B-L} gauge coupling should be
small with g_{B-L}\leq 10^{-4}.

dynamics such as genetic algorithms (GAs) is proposed and its validity is
numerically examined. We introduce a learning algorithm of Gibbs distributions
from training sets which are gene configurations (strings) generated by GA in
order to figure out the statistical properties of GA from the view point of
thermodynamics. The learning algorithm is constructed by means of minimization
of the Kullback-Leibler information between a parametric Gibbs distribution and
the empirical distribution of gene configurations. The formulation is applied
to the solvable probabilistic models having multi-valley energy landscapes,
namely, the spin glass chain and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. By using
computer simulations, we discuss the asymptotic behaviour of the effective
temperature scheduling and the residual energy induced by the GA dynamics.

into account a priori knowledge on these variables. For example, in many
applications (oceanography, finance...), there exists an order relation between
the two variables; when one takes high values, the other cannot take low
values, but the contrary is possible. The dependence for the high values of the
two variables is, therefore, not symmetric.
  However a minimal dependence also exists: low values of one variable are
associated with low values of the other variable. The dependence can also be
extreme for the maxima or the minima of the two variables. In this paper, we
construct step by step asymmetric copulas with asymptotic minimal dependence,
and with or without asymptotic maximal dependence, using mixture variables to
get at first asymmetric dependence and then minimal dependence. We fit these
models to a real dataset of sea states and compare them using Likelihood Ratio
Tests when they are nested, and BIC- criterion (Bayesian Information criterion)
otherwise.

single-photon source through implementing the decoy-state method. However,
security of all those theoretical results of decoy-state method based on the
original framework raised by Hwang needs monitoring the source state very
carefully, because the elementary proposition that the counting rates of the
same state from different sources are equal does not hold in general when the
source is unstable. Source intensity monitoring greatly decreases the system
efficiency. Here without using Hwang's proposition for stable source, we
present a sufficient condition for a secure decoy-state protocol without
monitoring the source intensity. The passive 2-intensity protocol proposed by
Adachi, Yamamoto, Koashi, and Imoto(AYKI) (Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 180503 (2007)
satisfies the condition. Therefore, the protocol can always work securely
without monitoring the source state or switching the source intensity. We also
show that our result can greatly improve the key rate of the 3-intensity
protocol with a fluctuating coherent-state source.

the geometry and topology of optimal transportation. We begin by reviewing an
old question (# 111) of Birkhoff in probability and statistics [4], which is to
give a necessary and sufficient condition on the support of a joint probability
to guarantee extremality among all measures which share its marginals.
Following work of Douglas, Lindenstrauss, and Bene\v{s} and \v{S}t\v{e}p\'an,
Hestir and Williams [15] found a necessary condition which is nearly
sufficient; we relax their subtle measurability hypotheses separating necessity
from sufficiency slightly, yet demonstrate by example that to be sufficient
certainly requires some measurability. Their condition amounts to the vanishing
of {\gamma} outside a countable alternating sequence of graphs and antigraphs
in which no two graphs (or two antigraphs) have domains that overlap, and where
the domain of each graph / antigraph in the sequence contains the range of the
succeeding antigraph (respectively, graph). Such sequences are called numbered
limb systems. Surprisingly, this characterization can be used to resolve the
uniqueness question for optimal transportation on manifolds with the topology
of the sphere.

like living species. They display high diversity, differentiate in space and
time, emerge and disappear. A large body of literature has explored the role of
information exchanges and communicative constraints in groups of agents under
selective scenarios. These models have been very helpful in providing a
rationale on how complex forms of communication emerge under evolutionary
pressures. However, other patterns of large-scale organization can be described
using mathematical methods ignoring communicative traits. These approaches
consider shorter time scales and have been developed by exploiting both
theoretical ecology and statistical physics methods. The models are reviewed
here and include extinction, invasion, origination, spatial organization,
coexistence and diversity as key concepts and are very simple in their defining
rules. Such simplicity is used in order to catch the most fundamental laws of
organization and those universal ingredients responsible for qualitative
traits. The similarities between observed and predicted patterns indicate that
an ecological theory of language is emerging, supporting (on a quantitative
basis) its ecological nature, although key differences are also present. Here
we critically review some recent advances lying and outline their implications
and limitations as well as open problems for future research.

dispersive. The dominance of the MI in the LEAF-fibre-based system suppresses
the SBS gain, degrading the SBS slow light delay and limiting the SBS
gain-bandwidth to 126 dB \cdot GHz. In a dispersion-shifted highly nonlinear
