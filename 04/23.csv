a plasma activated sintering within an originally developed TiN coated graphite
mold. The surface of porous titanium sheet with or without a coated graphite
mold was characterized. The cell adhesion property of porous titanium sheet was
also evaluated in this study. The peak of TiC was detected on the titanium
sheet processed with the graphite mold without a TiN coating. Since the
titanium fiber elements were directly in contact with the carbon graphite mold
during processing, surface contamination was unavoidable event in this
condition. The TiC peak was not detectable on the titanium sheet processed
within the TiN coated carbon graphite mold. This modified plasma activated
sintering with the TiN coated graphite mold would be useful to fabricate a
contamination free titanium sheet. The number of adherent cells on the modified
titanium sheet was greater than that of the bare titanium plate. Stress fiber
formation and the extension of the cells were observed on the titanium sheets.
This modified titanium sheet is expected to be a new tissue engineering
material in orthopedic bone repair.

A classical result of Littlewood-Offord and Erdos from the 1940s asserts that
if the v_i are non-zero, then rho(V) is O(n^{-1/2}). Since then, many
researchers obtained improved bounds by assuming various extra restrictions on

one would like to give a characterization of the set V, given that rho(V) is
relatively large. In this paper, we introduce a new method to attack the
inverse problem. As an application, we strengthen a previous result of Tao and
Vu, obtaining an optimal characterization for V. This immediately implies
several classical theorems, such as those of Sarkozy-Szemeredi and Halasz. The
method also applies in the continuous setting and leads to a simple proof for
the beta-net theorem of Tao and Vu, which plays a key role in their recent

different units (photons/MeV or photons/m) and for different wavelength
intervals. In this work we present a comparison of available results normalized
to its value in photons/MeV for the 337 nm band at 800 hPa and 293 K. The
conversion of photons/m to photons/MeV requires an accurate determination of
the energy deposited by the electrons in the field of view of the experimental
setup. We have calculated the energy deposition for each experiment by means of
a detailed Monte Carlo simulation including when possible the geometrical
details of the particular setup. Our predictions on deposited energy, as well
as on some geometrical factors, have been compared with those reported by the
authors of the corresponding experiments and possible corrections to the
fluorescence yields are proposed.

the dispersion relation of the collective modes is determined by a

This effect is analyzed numerically as a function of the separation between the

periodic dependence on the transverse wave vector. For the bundle, the Coulomb

to the dispersion ""kinks"" observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES). However, a direct a reconciliation of the energy scales and features
observed by the two probes is presently lacking. In this paper we examine the
general features of el-boson coupling in a $d-$wave superconductor using
Eliashberg theory, focusing on the structure of the modulations and the role of
self energy contributions $\lambda_z$ and $\lambda_{\phi}$. We identify the
features in the DOS that correspond to the gap-shifted bosonic mode energies
and discuss how the structure of the modulations provides information about an
underlying pairing mechanism and the pairing nature of the boson. We argue that
the scenario most consistent with the STM data is that of a low-energy boson
mode renormalizing over a second dominant pairing interaction and we identify
this low-energy mode as the out-of-phase bond buckling oxygen phonon. The
influence of inelastic damping on the phonon-modulated DOS is also examined for
the case of Bi$_2$Si$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. Using this simplified framework
we are able to account for the observed isotope shift and anti-correlation
between the local gap and mode energies. Combined, this work provides a direct
reconciliation of the bandstructure renormalizations observed by both ARPES and

the InAs quantum well and a hole layer in the GaSb quantum well, forming the
so-called two dimensional electron-hole bilayer system. Unlike the samples
studied in the past, the hybridization of the electron and hole subbands in our
samples is largely reduced by having narrower wells and an AlSb barrier layer
interposed between the InAs and the GaSb quantum wells, rendering them weakly
hybridized. Previous studies have revealed multiple absorption modes near the
electron cyclotron resonance of the InAs layer in moderately and strongly
hybridized samples, while only a single absorption mode was observed in the
weakly hybridized samples. We have observed a pair of absorption modes
occurring only at magnetic fields higher than 14T, which exhibited several
interesting phenomena. Among which we found two unique types of behavior that
distinguishes this work from the ones reported in the literature. This pair of
modes is very robust against rising thermal excitations and increasing magnetic
fields alligned parallel to the heterostructures. While the previous results
were aptly explained by the antilevel crossing gap due to the hybridization of
the electron and hole wavefunctions, i.e. conduction-valence Landau level
mixing, the unique features reported in this paper cannot be explained within
the same concept. The unusual properties found in this study and their
connection to the known models for InAs/GaSb heterostructures will be
disccused; in addition, several alternative ideas will be proposed in this

this result and delineate the key physics leading to the effect. We find that,
even if real, the induced quadrupole would be smaller than claimed. We discuss
reasons why the {\it WMAP} data are unlikely to suffer from this particular
systematic effect, including the implications for observations of point
sources. Given this evidence against the reality of the effect, the similarity
between the pointing-offset-induced signal and the actual quadrupole then
appears to be quite puzzling. However, we find that the effect arises from a
convolution between the gradient of the dipole field and anisotropic coverage
of the scan direction at each pixel. There is something of a directional
conspiracy here -- the dipole signal lies close to the Ecliptic Plane, and its
direction, together with the {\it WMAP} scan strategy, results in a strong
coupling to the $Y_{2,\,-1}$ component in Ecliptic co-ordinates. The dominant
strength of this component in the measured quadrupole suggests that one should
exercise increased caution in interpreting its estimated amplitude. The {\it

couple the dipole and quadrupole in this way and will soon provide an
independent measurement.

addition, these observations have helped to confirm that z~4-5 SMGs possess the

major mergers, and show that the formation of slowly-rotating elliptical

to be properly modelled. Our sample of equal-mass merger models encompasses
various masses and spatial resolutions, ranging from about 200pc and 10^5
particles per component, typical of some recently published major merger
simulations, to up to 32pc and 10^3 M_sun in simulations using 2.4 x 10^7
collisionless particles and 1.2 x 10^7 gas particles, among the highest
resolutions reached so far for gas-rich major merger of massive disc galaxies.
We find that the formation of fast-rotating early-type galaxies, that are
flattened by a significant residual rotation, is overall correctly reproduced
at all such resolutions. However, the formation of slow-rotating early-type
galaxies, which have a low residual angular momentum and are supported mostly
by anisotropic velocity dispersions, is strongly resolution-dependent. The
evacuation of angular momentum from the main stellar body is largely missed at
standard resolution, and systems that should be slow rotators are then found to
be fast rotators. The effect is most important for gas-rich mergers, but is
also witnessed in mergers with an absent or modest gas component. The effect is
robust with respect to our initial conditions and interaction orbits, and
originates in the physical treatment of the relaxation process during the
coalescence of the galaxies. Our findings show that a high-enough resolution is
required to accurately model the global properties of merger remnants and the
evolution of their angular momentum. The role of gas-rich mergers of spiral
galaxies in the formation of slow-rotating ellipticals may therefore have been
underestimated.

switch from analog to digital transmissions, with new frequency allocations.
The redshifted HI frequency for CTA 21 falls within this band. CTA 21 has a
complex radio structure on a range of scales. The innermost prominent
components are separated by ~12 mas while weak diffuse emission extends for up
to ~300 mas. The HI absorption profile that we find has two main components,
one narrow, the other wider and blue-shifted. The total HI column density is
7.9 x 10^20 cm^-2, assuming a covering factor of unity and a spin temperature
of 100 K. This HI absorption confirms the recently determined optical redshift
of this faint galaxy of z ~ 0.907. We discuss this new detection in the light
of HI absorption studies towards compact radio sources, and also the
possibility that CTA 21 may be exhibiting multiple cycles of nuclear activity.
This new detection in CTA 21 is consistent with a strong trend for detection of
HI absorption in radio galaxies with evidence of episodic nuclear/jet activity.

quantum groups $U_\zeta$ (at roots of unity $\zeta$). These bounds depend only
on the root system, and not on the characteristic $p$ or the size of the root

Both in the quantum and algebraic group situation, these rates of growth
represent new and fundamental invariants attached to the root system $\Phi$.
For quantum groups $U_\zeta$ with a fixed $\Phi$, we show the sequence
  $\{\max_{L\,{\text{irred}}}\dim \opH^n(U_\zeta,L)\}_n$ has polynomial growth
independent of $\zeta$. In fact, we provide upper and lower bounds for the

in the algebraic group case remains an open question, though it is proved that
$\{\log\max_{L\,\text{\rm irred}}\dim\opH^n(G,L)\}$ has polynomial growth $\leq
3$ for any fixed prime $p$ (and $\leq 4$ if $p$ is allowed to vary with $n$).

introduce an arbitrary set of errors as long as (a) the fraction of errors is

the errors can be described by a sufficiently simple circuit. Codes for such
channel models are attractive since, like codes for standard adversarial
errors, they can handle channels whose true behavior is unknown or varying over
time.
  For two classes of channels, we provide explicit, efficiently
encodable/decodable codes of optimal rate where only inefficiently decodable
codes were previously known. In each case, we provide one encoder/decoder that
works for every channel in the class. The encoders are randomized, and
probabilities are taken over the (local, unknown to the decoder) coins of the
encoder and those of the channel.
  (1) Unique decoding for additive errors: We give the first construction of a
polynomial-time encodable/decodable code for additive (a.k.a. oblivious)
channels that achieve the Shannon capacity $1-H(p)$. These channels add an
arbitrary error vector $e\in\{0,1\}^N$ of weight at most $pN$ to the
transmitted word; the vector $e$ can depend on the code but not on the
particular transmitted word.
  (2) List-decoding for polynomial-time channels: For every constant $c>0$, we
give a Monte Carlo construction of an code with optimal rate (arbitrarily close
to $1-H(p)$) that efficiently recovers a short list containing the correct
message with high probability for channels describable by circuits of size at
most $N^c$. We justify the relaxation to list-decoding by showing that even
with bounded channels, uniquely decodable codes cannot have positive rate for

out the appearance of stronger antiferroelectric instabilities at the zone
boundaries around $m=4$, before the critical ratio for ferroelectricity is
reached and which still dominate beyond it. The dominant character of the
anti-ferroelectric instability is explained from the depolarizing field which
hardens the ferroelectric mode. This analysis allows us to predict that,

buildings to construct types for p-adic unitary groups. They needed maps which
respect the Moy-Prasad filtrations. That property is called (CLF), i.e.
compatibility with the Lie algebra filtrations. In the first part of this
thesis we generalise their results on such maps to the Quaternion-algebra case.
Let k0 be a p-adic field of residue characteristic not two. We consider a
semisimple k0-rational Lie algebra element beta of a unitary group G:=U(h)
defined over k0 with a signed hermitian form h. Let H be the centraliser of
beta in G. We prove the existence of an affine H(k0)-equivariant CLF-map j from
the enlarged Bruhat-Tits building B^1(H,k0) to B^1(G,k0). As conjectured by
Broussous the CLF-property determines j, if none of the factors of H is
k0-isomorphic to the isotropic orthogonal group of k0-rank one and all factors
are unitary groups. Under the weaker assumption that the affine CLF-map j is
only equivariant under the center of H^0(k0) it is uniquely determined up to a
translation of B^1(H,k0). The second part is devoted to the decoding of
embedding types by the geometry of a CLF-map. Embedding types have been studied
by Broussous and M. Grabitz. We consider a division algebra D of finite index
with a p-adic center F. The construction of simple types for GLn(D) in the
Budhnell-Kutzko framework required an investigation of strata which had to
fulfil a rigidity property. Giving a stratum especially means to fix a pair
(E,a) consisting of a field extension E|F in Mn(D) and a hereditary order a
which is stable under conjugation by E^x, in other words we fix an embedding of
E^x into the normalizer of a. Broussous and Grabitz classified these pairs with

of the diversity of its neural constituents. These constituents, excitatory and
inhibitory neurons, comprise an invariant ratio in vivo and form the substrate
for rhythmic oscillatory activity. To begin to elucidate the dynamical
mechanisms that underlie this balance, we construct novel neural circuits not
ordinarily found in nature. We culture several networks of neurons composed of
excitatory and inhibitory cells and use a multi-electrode array to study their
temporal dynamics as the balance is modulated. We use the electrode burst as
the temporal imprimatur to signify the presence of network activity. Burst
durations, inter-burst intervals, and the number of spikes participating within
a burst are used to illustrate the vivid dynamical differences between the
various cultured networks. When the network consists largely of excitatory
neurons, no network temporal structure is apparent. However, the addition of
inhibitory neurons evokes a temporal order. Calculation of the temporal
autocorrelation shows that when the number of inhibitory neurons is a major
fraction of the network, a striking network pattern materializes when none was
previously present.

support the idea of two distinct emitting regions with the hard component

screening, positive item corresponds to the clone having a specified DNA
segment, and it is necessary to identify and isolate the positive clones for
compiling the libraries. In the group test, a group of items, called pool, is
assayed in a lump in order to save the cost of testing, and positive items are
detected based on the observation from each pool. It is known that the design
of grouping, that is, pooling design is important to %reduce the estimation
bias and achieve accurate detection. In the probabilistic approach, positive
clones are picked up based on the posterior probability. Naive methods of
computing the posterior, however, involves exponentially many sums, and thus we
need a device. Loopy belief propagation (loopy BP) algorithm is one of popular
methods to obtain approximate posterior probability efficiently. There are some
works investigating the relation between the accuracy of the loopy BP and the
pooling design. Based on these works, we develop pooling design with small
estimation bias of posterior probability, and we show that the balanced
incomplete block design (BIBD) has nice property for our purpose. Some
numerical experiments show that the bias correction under the BIBD is useful to

the correlation function with fluid dynamics. Applying the Kramers-Kronig

time-dependent charge transfer through a parabolically confined quantum wire of
a finite length coupled to semi-infinite quasi two-dimensional leads. The
quantum wire and the leads are in a perpendicular external magnetic field. The
contacts to the left and right leads depend on time and are kept out of phase
to model a quantum turnstile of finite size. The effects of the driving period
of the turnstile, the external magnetic field, the character of the contacts,
and the chemical potential bias on the effectiveness of the charge transfer of
the turnstile are examined, both in the absence and in the presence of the
magnetic field. The interplay between the strength of the coupling and the
strength of the magnetic field is also discussed. We observe how the edge
states created in the presence of the magnetic field contribute to the pumped
charge.

highly monochromatic X-rays from a baseline XFEL undulator. Previous schemes
made use of a four-crystal fixed-exit monochromator in Bragg geometry. In such
monochromator the X-ray pulse acquires a cm-long path delay, which must be
compensated. For a single-bunch self-seeding scheme this requires a long
electron beam bypass, implying modifications of the baseline undulator
configuration. To avoid this problem, a double bunch self-seeding scheme based
on a special photoinjector setup was recently proposed. At variance, here we
propose a new time-domain method of monochromatization exploiting a single
crystal in the transmission direction, thus avoiding the problem of extra-path
delay for the X-ray pulse. The method can be realized using a temporal
windowing technique, requiring a magnetic delay for the electron bunch only.
The proposed setup is extremely simple and composed of as few as two simple
elements. These are the crystal and the short magnetic chicane, which
accomplishes three tasks by itself. It creates an offset for crystal
installation, it removes the electron micro-bunching produced in the first
undulator, and it acts as a delay line for temporal windowing. Using a single
crystal installed within a short magnetic chicane in the baseline undulator, it
is possible to decrease the bandwidth of the radiation well beyond the XFEL
design down to 10E-5. The installation of the magnetic chicane does not perturb
the undulator focusing system and does not interfere with the baseline mode of
operation. We present feasibility study and exemplifications for the SASE2 line
of the European XFEL.

the problem of finding an \emph{optimal} construction, in the sense of

For a fixed time step $h>0$, a large-deviations rate functional $J_h$
characterizes the behaviour of the particle system at $t=h$ in terms of the
initial distribution at $t=0$. For the diffusion equation, a single step in the
time-discretized entropy-Wasserstein gradient flow is characterized by the
minimization of a functional $K_h$. We establish a new connection between these
systems by proving that $J_h$ and $K_h$ are equal up to second order in $h$ as
$h\to0$. This result gives a microscopic explanation of the origin of the
entropy-Wasserstein gradient flow formulation of the diffusion equation.
Simultaneously, the limit passage presented here gives a physically natural
description of the underlying particle system by describing it as an entropic
gradient flow.

graph sparsification} problem requires sampling edges in $G$ and giving the
sampled edges appropriate weights to obtain a sparse graph $G_{\epsilon}$
(containing O(n\log n) edges in expectation) with the following property: the
weight of every cut in $G_{\epsilon}$ is within a factor of $(1\pm \epsilon)$
of the weight of the corresponding cut in $G$. We provide a generic framework
that sets out sufficient conditions for any particular sampling scheme to
result in good sparsifiers, and obtain a set of results by simple
instantiations of this framework. The results we obtain include the following:
(1) We improve the time complexity of graph sparsification from O(m\log^3 n) to
O(m + n\log^4 n) for graphs with polynomial edge weights. (2) We improve the
time complexity of graph sparsification from O(m\log^3 n) to O(m\log^2 n) for
graphs with arbitrary edge weights. (3) If the size of the sparsifier is
allowed to be O(n\log^2 n/\epsilon^2) instead of O(n\log n/\epsilon^2), we
improve the time complexity of sparsification to O(m) for graphs with
polynomial edge weights. (4) We show that sampling using standard
connectivities results in good sparsifiers, thus resolving an open question of
Benczur and Karger. As a corollary, we give a simple proof of (a slightly
weaker version of) a result due to Spielman and Srivastava showing that
sampling using effective resistances produces good sparsifiers. (5) We give a
simple proof showing that sampling using strong connectivities results in good
sparsifiers, a result obtained previously using a more involved proof by
Benczur and Karger. A key ingredient of our proofs is a generalization of
bounds on the number of small cuts in an undirected graph due to Karger; this
generalization might be of independent interest.

states, with a confinement strength close to what is used in experiments, the
error in the energy introduced by truncating triple excitations and beyond is
shown to be on the same level or less than the differences in energy given by
two different Quantum Monte Carlo methods. Convergence of the iterative

surprisingly weak confinement strengths even when starting from a
non-interacting basis. The limit where the missing triple and higher

unique solid-state system to investigate interacting condensates. Up to now,
disorder induced localization and short lifetimes have prevented the
establishment of long range off diagonal order needed for any quantum
manipulation of the condensate wavefunction. In this work, using a wire
microcavity with polariton lifetimes ten times longer than in all previously
existing samples, we show that polariton condensates can propagate over
macroscopic distances outside the excitation area, while preserving their
spontaneous spatial coherence. An extended condensate wave-function builds-up
with a degree of spatial coherence larger than 50% over distances 50 times the
polariton De Broglie wavelength. The expansion of the condensate is shown to be
governed by the repulsive potential induced by photo-generated excitons within
the excitation area. The control of this local potential offers a new and
versatile method to manipulate extended polariton condensates. As an
illustration, we demonstrate synchronization of extended condensates via
controlled tunnel coupling and localization of condensates in a trap with
optically controlled dimensions.

3--6, 2008, soon after the discovery of the source and near the peak of its
outburst. That time the source had a flux of about 50 mCrab and exhibited a
hard Comptonized X-ray spectrum extending well above 100 keV. Being
approximated by a power law with an exponetial cut-off in the broad 3--100 keV
energy band it gave the average photon index $\Gamma\simeq 1.6$ and
$kT_{cutoff}\simeq 67$ keV. We found only slight indications for changes in the
index during the observation ($\Gamma$ first steady decreased from $\sim 2.0$
to $\sim1.3$ and then increased back to $\sim 2.0$). However the $N_{\rmn H}$
value measured by absorption in the low energy part of the spectrum changed
drastically and very irregularly (from $\sim 4\times 10^{22}$ till $\sim
100\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$). There were 10 type I X-ray bursts detected from
the source during these TOO observations. Assuming that the Eddington
luminosity was reached during the burst with the highest peak flux we get an
upper estimate for a distance to the source $D=6.4\pm0.6$ kpc. From the X-ray

amplitudes of decay within and without the magnetic field, a scenario that
requires a Dirac neutrino magnetic moment six times lower than the Borexino
solar neutrino upper limit of 0.54 x 10E(-10) Bohr magneton. I also show in a

between massive neutrino amplitudes, if such interference could arise, is of a
period at least four orders of magnitude shorter than reported and must average
to zero given the time resolution of the GSI measurements.

fermions is mapped to the spin-1/2 XXZ model close to the critical point in the
highly polarized regime. The mappings are shown to be optimal in the sense that
they produce the least error possible for a given discretization length. As an

a number of the existing admissibility (or entropy) conditions and identify the

approach offers a streamlined and unifying perspective on many of the known

solutions are discussed, and existence results are given for fluxes satisfying

velocity dispersion sigma_V about 1400 km/s and X-ray temperature T_X about 10
keV. Our optical and X-ray analysis detects evidence for substructure. Our
results are consistent with the presence of two massive subclusters separated
by a LOS rest frame velocity difference V_rf about 2000 km/s, very closely
projected in the plane of sky along the SE-NW direction. The observational
picture, interpreted through the analytical two-body model, suggests that Abell
2294 is a cluster merger elongated mainly in the LOS direction and catched
during the bound outgoing phase, a few fractions of Gyr after the core
crossing. We find Abell 2294 is a very massive cluster with a range of M=2-4
10E15 M_sun. Moreover, contradicting previous findings, our new data do exclude
the presence of the H$\alpha$ emission in the spectrum of the BCG galaxy. The

thermonuclear reaction rates. We begin by reviewing commonly applied procedures
and point out that reaction rates that have been reported up to now in the
literature have no rigorous statistical meaning. Subsequently, we associate
each nuclear physics quantity entering in the calculation of reaction rates
with a specific probability density function, including Gaussian, lognormal and
chi-squared distributions. Based on these probability density functions the
total reaction rate is randomly sampled many times until the required
statistical precision is achieved. This procedure results in a median (Monte
Carlo) rate which agrees under certain conditions with the commonly reported
recommended ""classical"" rate. In addition, we present at each temperature a low
rate and a high rate, corresponding to the 0.16 and 0.84 quantiles of the
cumulative reaction rate distribution. These quantities are in general
different from the statistically meaningless ""minimum"" (or ""lower limit"") and
""maximum"" (or ""upper limit"") reaction rates which are commonly reported.
Furthermore, we approximate the output reaction rate probability density
function by a lognormal distribution and present, at each temperature, the
lognormal parameters miu and sigma. The values of these quantities will be
crucial for future Monte Carlo nucleosynthesis studies. Our new reaction rates,
appropriate for bare nuclei in the laboratory, are tabulated in the second
paper of this series (Paper II). The nuclear physics input used to derive our
reaction rates is presented in the third paper of this series (Paper III). In

The framework allows food web models to include ontogenetic growth and
life-history omnivory at the individual level by resolving the population
structure of each species as a size-spectrum. Each species is characterised by
the trait 'size at maturation', and all model parameters are made species
independent through scaling with individual body size and size at maturation.
Parameter values are determined from cross-species analysis of fish communities
as life-history omnivory is widespread in aquatic systems, but may be
reparameterised for other systems. An ensemble of food webs is generated and
the resulting communities are analysed at four levels of organisation:
community level, species level, trait level, and individual level. The model
may be solved analytically by assuming that the community spectrum follows a
power law. The analytical solution provides a baseline expectation of the
results of complex food web simulations, and agrees well with the predictions
of the full model on 1) biomass distribution as a function of individual size,
2) biomass distribution as a function of size at maturation, and 3) relation
between predator-prey mass ratio of preferred and eaten food. The full model

important tools to understand the chemical evolution of galaxies: in
particular, the study of chemical evolution models can improve our
understanding of the basic assumptions made for modelling our Galaxy and other
spirals. To test a standard chemical evolution model for spiral disks in the
Local Universe and study the influence of a threshold gas density and different
efficiencies in the star formation rate (SFR) law on radial gradients
(abundance, gas and SFR). We adopt a one-infall chemical evolution model where
the Galactic disk forms inside-out by means of infall of gas, and we test
different thresholds and efficiencies in the SFR. The model is scaled to the
disk properties of three Local Group galaxies (the Milky Way, M31 and M33) by
varying its dependence on the star formation efficiency and the time scale for
the infalling gas into the disk. Using this simple model we are able to
reproduce most of the observed constraints available in the literature for the
studied galaxies. The radial oxygen abundance gradients and their time
evolution are studied in detail. The present day abundance gradients are more
sensitive to the threshold than to other parameters, while their temporal
evolutions are more dependent on the chosen SFR efficiency. The most massive
disks seem to have evolved faster (i.e. with more efficient star formation)
than the less massive ones, thus suggesting a downsizing in star formation for
spirals. The threshold and the efficiency of star formation play a very
important role in the chemical evolution of spiral disks and an efficiency
varying with radius can be used to regulate the star formation. The oxygen
abundance gradient can steepen or flatten in time depending on the choice of
this parameter

contrast to the expectation of a continuum of gap-less excitations above a spin
liquid-like ground state our results reveal three distinct inelastic modes
found at 0.04(1), 0.12(2) an 0.58(3) meV at 0.06 K. The inelastic modes can be
attributed to the magnetic ground state with the lowest and highest energy
excitations showing spatial dependencies indicative of dimerized short range
antiferromagnetic correlations. Short range correlations, reminiscent of spin
liquid-like order, are static within the instrumental resolution (50 $\mu$eV)
and represent 82% of the spectral weight. Longer range correlations, first
observed by Petrenko, et al.\cite{Petrenko1998, develop below 0.14 ~K within
the elastic cross section. The short range static correlations and dynamic
components survive to high temperatures, comparable to the nearest neighbor
exchange interactions. Our results suggest that the ground state of a three
dimensional hyperkagom\'e compound differs distinctly from its frustrated
counterparts on a pyrochlore lattice and reveals a juxtaposition of spin liquid
order and strong dimerised coupling.

and a complex internal structure. We take the simplest hole in string theory --
the extremal 2-charge D1D5 hole -- and study a simple effect that is a
consequence of this internal structure of the fuzzball. Suppose we have a NS1
string wrapping the compact circle of the fuzzball solution. In the traditional
black hole solution this circle is directly tensored with the remaining
directions, and does not shrink to zero size. Thus a part of the string can
fall behind the horizon, but not `unwind'. In the fuzzball geometry, this
circle makes a nontrivial geometric structure -- the KK monople -- by mixing
with the other directions, and thus shrinks to zero at the core of the
monopole. Thus the string can `unwind' in the fuzzball geometry, and the
winding charge is then manifested by a nontrivial field strength living on the
microstate solution. We compute this field strength for a generic microstate,
and comment briefly on the physics suggested by the unwinding process.

how the eccentricity is distributed in such a disc and how the distribution in
turn affects the instability growth rate for a range of disc properties. We
identify a disc mode, termed the superhump mode, that is likely at work in the
superhump binary star case. The mode results from the excitation of the

Nd, Pr,...) family are observed even for doping levels for which
superconductivity exists. We have looked for a similar property in a different
electron-doped cuprate family, Sr1-xLaxCuO2, which consists of CuO2 planes
separated by Sr/La atoms, and is exempt of the possible influence of magnetic
rare earth ions. We report in-plane magnetoresistance measurements in the
normal state of underdoped, superconducting, c-axis oriented, epitaxial
Sr1-xLaxCuO2 thin films. This probe is sensitive to spin arrangement and we
find that the in-plane magnetoresistance, which is negative and does not
saturate for T, exhibits an angular dependence when measured upon rotating a
magnetic field within the CuO2 planes. The analysis reveals a superposition of
fourfold and twofold angular oscillations. Both of these increase in amplitude
with increasing field and decreasing and appear below a temperature, which gets
higher with decreasing doping levels. Our results demonstrate that these
magnetoresistance oscillations, also observed for the Ln2-xCexCuO4 (Ln = Nd,
Pr,...) family and attributed to an AF signature, are, without ambiguity, a
property of CuO2 planes. Besides, these oscillations vary with doping in an
unusual way compared to previous results: fourfold oscillations are essentially
present in the more underdoped samples while only twofold oscillations are
visible in the less underdoped ones. This intriguing observation appears to be
a consequence of spin dilution with increasing doping level.

standard model. We present a class of models in which the first and second
generation fermions are SUSY partners of pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons that
parameterize a non-compact Kahler manifold, explaining the small values of
these fermion masses relative to those of the third generation. We also provide
an example of such a model. We find that various regions of the parameter space
in this scenario can give the correct dark matter abundance, and that nearly
all of these regions evade other phenomenological constraints. We show that for
gluino mass ~700 GeV, model points from these regions can be easily
distinguished from other mSUGRA points at the LHC with only 7 fb^(-1) of
integrated luminosity at 14 TeV. The most striking signatures are a dearth of
b- and tau-jets, a great number of multi-lepton events, and either an
""inverted"" slepton mass hierarchy, narrowed slepton mass hierarchy, or
characteristic small-mu spectrum.

photometric and spectroscopic evidence suggests that the clusters' early
formation history was more complicated. In particular, clusters show
star-to-star abundance variations, and multiple sequences in their
colour-magnitude diagrams. These effects seem to be restricted to globular
clusters, and are not found in open clusters or the field. In this paper, we
combine the two competing models for these multiple populations and include a
consideration of the effects of stellar collisions. Collisions are one of the
few phenomena which occur solely in dense stellar environments like
(proto-)globular clusters. We find that runaway collisions between massive
stars can produce material which has abundances comparable to the observed
second generations, but that very little total mass is produced by this
channel. We then add the contributions of rapidly-rotating massive stars (under
the assumption that massive stars are spun up by collisions and interactions),
and the contribution of asymptotic giant branch stars. We find that collisions
can help produce the extreme abundances which are seen in some clusters.
However, the total amount of material produced in these generations is still
too small (by at least a factor of 10) to match the observations. We conclude
with a discussion of the additional effects which probably need to be
considered to solve this particular problem.

in the A=14 to 40 region are tabulated. The results are obtained using a
method, based on Monte Carlo techniques, that has been described in the
preceding paper of this series (Paper I). We present a low rate, median rate
and high rate which correspond to the 0.16, 0.50 and 0.84 quantiles,
respectively, of the cumulative reaction rate distribution. The meaning of
these quantities is in general different from the commonly reported, but
statistically meaningless expressions, ""lower limit"", ""nominal value"" and
""upper limit"" of the total reaction rate. In addition, we approximate the Monte
Carlo probability density function of the total reaction rate by a lognormal
distribution and tabulate the lognormal parameters {\mu} and {\sigma} at each
temperature. We also provide a quantitative measure (Anderson-Darling test
statistic) for the reliability of the lognormal approximation. The user can
implement the approximate lognormal reaction rate probability density functions
directly in a stellar model code for studies of stellar energy generation and
nucleosynthesis. For each reaction, the Monte Carlo reaction rate probability
density functions, together with their lognormal approximations, are displayed
graphically for selected temperatures in order to provide a visual impression.
Our new reaction rates are appropriate for bare nuclei in the laboratory. The
nuclear physics input used to derive our reaction rates is presented in the
subsequent paper of this series (Paper III). In the fourth paper of this series
(Paper IV) we compare our new reaction rates to previous results.
