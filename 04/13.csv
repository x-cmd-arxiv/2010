This assumption leads to potential paradoxes, such as the presence of a maximum
information associated to a channel that would actually create completely wrong
interpretations of the signals. Game-theoretic models of language evolution use
this view of Shannon's theory, but other approaches considering embodied
communicating agents show that the correct (meaningful) match resulting from

the problem correctly. How can Shannon's theory be expanded in such a way that
meaning -at least, in its minimal referential form- is properly incorporated?
Inspired by the concept of {\em duality of the communicative sign} stated by
the swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, here we present a complete

The method has been inspired by both the stretched-exponential model proposed

able to discriminate different cerebral tissues on the basis of their
complexity, expressed by the stretching exponent gamma and of the anisotropy of
gamma across different directions. Nevertheless, these quantities were not
defined as scalar invariants like mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy,
which are eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor. We hypotesize instead that the
signal may be espressed as a simple stretched-exponential only along the
principal axes of diffusion, while in a generic direction the signal is modeled
as a combination of three different stretched-exponentials. In this way, we
derived indices to quantify both the tissue anomalous diffusion and its
anisotropy, independently of the reference frame of the experiment. We tested
and compare our new method with DTI and HB approaches applying them to 10
healty subjects brain at 3T. Our experimental results show that our parameters
are highly correlated to intrinsic local geometry when compared to HB indices.
Moreover, they offer a different kind of contrast when compared to DTI outputs.
Specifically, our indices show a higher capability to discriminate among
different areas of the corpus callosum, which are known to be associated to
different axonal densities.

$(\rmnum{1})$ the normal transonic shocks in a straight duct with finite or
infinite length, after fixing a point the shock-front passing through;
$(\rmnum{2})$ the oblique transonic shocks attached to an infinite wedge;
$(\rmnum{3})$ a flat Mach configuration containing one supersonic shock, two
transonic shocks, and a contact discontinuity, after fixing the point the four
discontinuities intersect. These special solutions are constructed
traditionally under the assumption that they are piecewise constant, and they
have played important roles in the studies of mathematical gas dynamics. Our
results show that the assumption of piecewise constant can be replaced by some
more weaker assumptions on the downstream subsonic flows, which are sufficient
to uniquely determine these special solutions.
  Mathematically, these are uniqueness results on solutions of free boundary
problems of a quasi-linear system of elliptic-hyperbolic composite-mixed type
in bounded or unbounded planar domains, without any assumptions on smallness.
The proof relies on an elliptic system of pressure $p$ and the tangent of the
flow angle $w=v/u$ obtained by decomposition of the Euler system in Lagrangian
coordinates, and a newly developed method for the $L^{\infty}$ estimate that is
independent of the free boundaries, by combining the maximum principles of
elliptic equations, and careful analysis of shock polar applied on the (maybe

and shift of all spectral features towards higher energies by ~4% with
decreasing temperature from 296 K to 10 K was found. However, no detectable
change at the tetragonal - orthorhombic phase transition around 100 K was
observed. Application of a pressure of 6.7 GPa, connected with an increase of
the superconducting temperature from 8 K to 34 K, results in an increase of the
optical phonon mode energies at 296 K by ~12%, and an even more pronounced
increase for the lowest-lying transversal acoustic mode. Despite these strong
pressure-induced modifications of the phonon-DOS we conclude that the
pronounced increase of Tc in Fe1.01Se with pressure cannot be described in the

importance of spin fluctuations to the observed superconductivity.

lasts a few tens of milliseconds and a sensor for slow asynchronous release
that lasts a few hundred milliseconds. We show that a variety of extant data on
CA3-CA1 synapse can be accounted for consistently only when a refractory period
of the order of few milliseconds between releases is introduced. Including a
second sensor for asynchronous release that has a slow unbinding site and
therefore an embedded long memory, is shown to play a role in short-term
plasticity by facilitating release. For synchronous release mediated by
Synaptotagmin II a third time scale is revealed in addition to the fast and
slow release. This third time scale corresponds to ""stimulus-correlated
super-fast"" neurotransmitter release. Our detailed spatial simulation indicates
that all three-time scales of neurotransmitter release are an emergent property
of the calcium sensor and independent of synaptic ultrastructure. Furthermore,
it allows us to identify features of synaptic transmission that are universal

In order to resolve this paradox, evolutionary game theory has focused on the

we encode strategies for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) in terms of
conditional probabilities that represent the response of decision pathways
given previous plays. We find that if these stochastic strategies are encoded
as genes that undergo Darwinian evolution, the environmental conditions that
the strategies are adapting to determine the fixed point of the evolutionary
trajectory, which could be either cooperation or defection. A transition
between cooperative and defective attractors occurs as a function of different
parameters such a mutation rate, replacement rate, and memory, all of which
affect a player's ability to predict an opponent's behavior.

insertion of a single surface operator has been treated (in a semi-classical
limit). In this paper we study and generalise this proposal. Our approach
relies on the use of topological string theory techniques. On the B-model side
we show that the effects of multiple surface operator insertions in 4d N=2

method, valid beyond the semi-classical limit. On the mirror A-model side we
find by explicit computations that the 5d lift of the SU(N) gauge theory
partition function in the presence of (one or many) surface operators is equal
to an A-model topological string partition function with the insertion of (one
or many) toric branes. This is in agreement with an earlier proposal by Gukov.
Our A-model results were motivated by and agree with what one obtains by
combining the AGT conjecture with the dual interpretation in terms of
degenerate operators. The topological string theory approach also opens up new
possibilities in the study of 2d Toda field theories.

in several (sub)millimeter bands using the APEX telescope during three
observing periods. To determine the spatial distribution of the
$\mathrm{^{12}CO(3-2)}$ emission, mapping observations were performed. To
constrain the physical conditions in the circumstellar envelope, multiple
rotational CO emission lines were modeled using a non local thermodynamic
equilibrium radiative transfer code. The rotational temperatures and the
abundances of the other molecules were obtained assuming local thermodynamic
equilibrium. An oxygen-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch star has been surveyed in
the submillimeter wavelength range. Thirty four transitions of twelve molecular
species, including maser lines, were detected. The kinetic temperature of the
envelope was determined and the molecular abundance fractions of the molecules
were estimated. The deduced molecular abundances were compared with
observations and modeling from the literature and agree within a factor of 10,
except for SO$_2$, which is found to be almost a factor 100 stronger than
predicted by chemical models. From this study, we found that IK Tau is a good
laboratory to study the conditions in circumstellar envelopes around
oxygen-rich stars with (sub)millimeter-wavelength molecular lines. We could
also expect from this study that the molecules in the circumstellar envelope
can be explained more faithful by non-LTE analysis with lower and higher
transition lines than by simple LTE analysis with only lower transition lines.
In particular, the observed CO line profiles could be well reproduced by a
simple expanding envelope model with a power law structure.

cosmological distances, with the intervening EBL results in electron-positron
pair production that leads to energy-dependent attenuation of the observed VHE
flux. This introduces a fundamental ambiguity in the interpretation of measured
VHE gamma-ray spectra: neither the intrinsic spectrum, nor the EBL, are
separately known -- only their combination is. In this paper we propose a
method to measure the EBL photon number density. It relies on using
simultaneous observations of BL Lac objects in the optical, X-ray, high-energy
(HE: E>100 MeV) gamma-ray (from the Fermi telescope), and VHE gamma-ray (from
Cherenkov telescopes) bands. For each source, the method involves best-fitting
the spectral energy distribution (SED) from optical through HE gamma-rays (the
latter being largely unaffected by EBL attenuation as long as z<1) with a
Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) model. We extrapolate such best-fitting models
into the VHE regime, and assume they represent the BL Lacs' intrinsic emission.
Contrasting measured versus intrinsic emission leads to a determination of the
photon-photon opacity to VHE photons. Using, for each given source, different
states of emission will only improve the accuracy of the proposed method. We
demonstrate this method using recent simultaneous multi-frequency observations
of the high-frequency-peaked BL Lac object PKS 2155-304 and discuss how similar
observations can more accurately probe the EBL.

annihilation/decay channels $2e$, $2\mu$, $2\tau$, $4e$, or $4\mu$ (the latter
two via an intermediate light particle $\phi$) are generated with PYTHIA. We
calculate both the Galactic and extragalactic prompt and inverse Compton (IC)
contributions to the resulting gamma-ray spectra. To find the Galactic IC
spectra we use the interstellar radiation field model from the latest release
of GALPROP. For the extragalactic signal we show that the amplitude of the
prompt gamma-emission is very sensitive to the assumed model for the
extragalactic background light. For our Galaxy we use the Einasto, NFW and
Isothermal DM density profiles and include the effects of DM substructure
assuming a simple subhalo model. Our calculations show that for the
annihilating DM the extragalactic gamma-ray signal can dominate only if rather
extreme power-law concentration-mass relation $C(M)$ is used, while more
realistic $C(M)$ relations make the extragalactic component comparable or
subdominant to the Galactic signal. For the decaying DM the Galactic signal
always exceeds the extragalactic one. In the case of annihilating DM the PFH
favored parameters can be ruled out only if power-law $C(M)$ relation is
assumed. For DM decaying into $2\mu$ or $4\mu$ the PFH favored DM parameters
are not in conflict with the Fermi gamma-ray data. We find that, due to the
(almost) featureless Galactic IC spectrum and the DM halo substructure,
annihilating DM may give a good simultaneous fit to the isotropic diffuse
gamma-ray and to the PFH $e^\pm$ data without being in clear conflict with the
other Fermi-LAT gamma-ray measurements.

and show how to accurately determine the degree of divergence of a 5D loop
diagram using both the 5D and KK formalism. This power counting can be
obfuscated in the 4D Kaluza-Klein formalism and we explicitly point out

increase of the S_N-value above and below a galaxy magnitude of Mv = -20 mag.
Over the full mass range, the S_L-value of early-type galaxies is, on average,
twice that of late-types. To investigate the observed trends we derive
theoretical predictions of GC system scaling parameters as a function of host
galaxy mass based on the models of Dekel & Birnboim (2006) in which
star-formation processes are regulated by stellar and supernova feedback below
a stellar mass of 3x10^10 M_sol, and by virial shocks above it. We find that
the analytical model describes remarkably well the shape of the GC system
scaling parameter distributions with a universal specific GC formation
efficiency, eta, which relates the total mass in GCs to the total galaxy halo
mass. Early-type and late-type galaxies show a similar mean value of eta =
5.5e-5, with an increasing scatter towards lower galaxy masses. This can be due
to the enhanced stochastic nature of the star and star-cluster formation
processes for such systems. Some massive galaxies have excess eta values
compared to what is expected from the mean model prediction for galaxies more
luminous than Mv = -20 mag (Lv=10^10L_sol). This may be attributed to a very
efficient early GC formation, less efficient production of field stars or
accretion of predominantly low-mass/luminosity high-eta galaxies, or a mixture
of all these effects. (Abridged)

with Minkowski space time with metric ds^2= dt^2-dx^2. This extra contribution
can be traced to the unphysical degrees of freedom (in Minkowski space). The
technical reason for this effect to occur is the property of Bogolubov's
coefficients which mix the positive and negative frequencies modes. The
corresponding mixture can not be avoided because the projections to positive
-frequency modes with respect to Minkowski time t and positive -frequency modes
with respect to the Rindler observer's proper time \eta are not equivalent. The
exact cancellation of unphysical degrees of freedom which is maintained in
Minkowski space can not hold in the Rindler space. In BRST approach this effect
manifests itself as the presence of BRST charge density in L and R parts. An
inertial observer in Minkowski vacuum |0> observes a universe with no net BRST
charge only as a result of cancellation between the two. However, the Rindler
observers who do not ever have access to the entire space time would see a net
BRST charge. In this respect the effect resembles the Unruh effect. The effect
is infrared (IR) in nature, and sensitive to the horizon and/or boundaries. We
interpret the extra energy as the formation of the ""ghost condensate"" when the
ghost degrees of freedom can not propagate, but nevertheless do contribute to
the vacuum energy. Exact computations in this simple 2d model support the claim
made in [1] that the ghost contribution might be responsible for the observed
dark energy in 4d FLRW universe.

formation (SF) that causes strong excess in UV flux, yet leaves the optical
colors red. Many of these studies were based on GALEX imaging of SDSS galaxies
(z~0.1), and were thus limited by its 5"" FWHM. Poor UV resolution left other
possibilities for UV excess open, such as the old populations or an AGN. Here
we study high-resolution far-ultraviolet HST/ACS images of optically quiescent
early-type galaxies with strong UV excess. The new images show that
three-quarters of these moderately massive (~5x10^10 M_sun) early-type galaxies
shows clear evidence of extended SF, usually in form of wide or concentric UV
rings, and in some cases, striking spiral arms. SDSS spectra probably miss
these features due to small fiber size. UV-excess early-type galaxies have on
average less dust and larger UV sizes (D>40 kpc) than other green-valley
galaxies, which argues for an external origin for the gas that is driving the
SF. Thus, most of these galaxies appear `rejuvenated' (e.g., through minor
gas-rich mergers or IGM accretion). For a smaller subset of the sample, the
declining SF (from the original internal gas) cannot be ruled out. SF is rare
in very massive early-types (M_* > 10^11 M_sun), a possible consequence of AGN
feedback. In addition to extended UV emission, many galaxies show a compact
central source, which may be a weak, optically inconspicuous AGN.

the physics of vacua in which these symmetries are spontaneously broken

changes in the expansion of the Universe from the radiation energy density (2)
heating of the IGM by free-free absorption; (3) radiation pressure squeezing of
IGM clouds by external radio waves; (4) synchrotron heating of electrons in

bubbles transport material: drift, wake transport and entrainment. The first of

material, giving rise to a net upward displacement of the fluid behind the
bubble. For a spherical bubble, the mass of upwardly displaced material is
roughly equal to half the mass displaced by the bubble, and should be ~
10^{7-9} solar masses depending on the local ICM and bubble parameters. We show
that in classical cool core clusters, the upward displacement by drift may be a
key process in explaining the presence of filaments behind bubbles. A bubble
also carries a parcel of material in a region at its rear, known as the wake.
The mass of the wake is comparable to the drift mass and increases the average
density of the bubble, trapping it closer to the cluster centre and reducing
the amount of heating it can do during its ascent. Moreover, material dropping
out of the wake will also contribute to the trailing filaments. Mass transport
by the bubble wake can effectively prevent the build-up of cool material in the
central galaxy, even if AGN heating does not balance ICM cooling. Finally, we
consider entrainment, the process by which ambient material is incorporated
into the bubble. Abridged

deviations from the luminosity-angular diameter distance relation

an opacity $\Delta\tau<0.012$ (95% C.L.), a factor of 2 stronger than the

binaries that host a neutron star accreting mass from the wind of its OB
supergiant companion. They are characterized by an extremely pronounced and
rapid variability in X-rays, which still lacks an unambiguous interpretation. A
number of deep pointed observations with XMM-Newton have been carried out to
study the quiescent emission of these sources and gain insight into the
mechanism that causes their X-ray variability. Aims. We continued this study by
using three XMM-Newton observations of the two supergiant fast X-ray transient
prototypes XTEJ1739-302 and IGR J08408-4503 in quiescence. Methods. An in-depth
timing and spectral analysis of these data have been carried out. Results. We
found that the quiescent emission of these sources is characterized by both
complex timing and spectral variability, with multiple small flares occurring
sporadically after periods of lower X-ray emission. Some evidence is found in
the XMM-Newton spectra of a soft component below ~2 keV, similar to that
observed in the two supergiant fast X-ray transients AXJ1845.0-0433 and
IGRJ16207-5129 and in many other high mass X-ray binaries. Conclusions.We
suggest some possible interpretations of the timing and spectral properties of

In 2000, Pauplin showed that the BME method is equivalent to optimizing a
linear functional over the BME polytope, the convex hull of the BME vectors
obtained from Pauplin's formula applied to all binary trees. The BME method is
related to the Neighbor Joining (NJ) algorithm, now known to be a greedy
optimization of the BME principle. Further, the NJ and BME algorithms have been
studied previously to understand when the NJ Algorithm returns a BME tree for
small numbers of taxa. In this paper we aim to elucidate the structure of the
BME polytope and strengthen knowledge of the connection between the BME method
and NJ Algorithm. We first prove that any subtree-prune-regraft move from a
binary tree to another binary tree corresponds to an edge of the BME polytope.
Moreover, we describe an entire family of faces parametrized by disjoint
clades. We show that these {\em clade-faces} are smaller dimensional BME
polytopes themselves. Finally, we show that for any order of joining nodes to
form a tree, there exists an associated distance matrix (i.e., dissimilarity
map) for which the NJ Algorithm returns the BME tree. More strongly, we show
that the BME cone and every NJ cone associated to a tree $T$ have an
intersection of positive measure.

normally communicated to quarks and leptons by a set of vector bosons with
masses generated via sequential breaking of a larger gauge symmetry. In
reasonably ultraviolet-complete theories of this type, the number of stages of
breaking of the larger gauge symmetry is usually equal to the observed number
of quark and lepton generations, $N_{gen.}=3$. Here we investigate the general
question of how the construction and properties of these models depend on
$N_{gen.}$, regarded as a variable. We build and analyze models with
illustrative values of $N_{gen.}$ different from 3 (namely, $N_{gen.}=1,2,4$)
that exhibit the necessary sequential symmetry breaking down to a strongly
coupled sector that dynamically breaks electroweak symmetry. Our results for
variable $N_{gen.}$ show that one can robustly obtain, for this latter sector,
a theory with a gauge coupling that is large but slowly running, controlled by
an approximate infrared fixed point of the renormalization group. Owing to
this, we find that for all of the values of $N_{gen.}$ considered,
standard-model fermions of the highest generation have masses that can be
comparable to the electroweak-symmetry breaking scale. We also study the
interplay of multiple strongly coupled gauge symmetries in these models.

exceptions to the unified model. After examining a number of proposed
candidates critically, we find that the sample is contaminated significantly by
objects with BELs of strengths indicating that they actually contain
intermediate-type AGNs, plus a few Compton-thick sources as revealed by
extremely low ratios of X-ray to nuclear IR luminosities. We develop
quantitative metrics that show two (NGC 3147 and NGC 4594) of the remaining
candidates to have BELs 2-3 orders of magnitude weaker than those of typical
type-1 AGNs. Several more galaxies remain as candidates to have anomalously
weak BELs, but this status cannot be confirmed with the existing information.
Although the parent sample is poorly defined, the two confirmed objects are
well under 1% of its total number of members, showing that the absence of a BEL
is possible, but very uncommon in AGN. We evaluate these two objects in detail
using multi-wavelength measurements. They have little X-ray extinction with N_H
< 10^21 cm^{-2}. Their IR spectra show strong silicate emission (NGC 4594) or
weak aromatic features on a generally power law continuum with a suggestion of
silicates in emission (NGC 3147). No polarized BEL is detected in NGC 3147.
These results indicate that the two unobscured type-2 objects have
circumnuclear tori that are approximately face-on. Combined with their X-ray
and optical/UV properties, this behavior implies that we have an unobscured
view of the nuclei and thus that they have intrinsically weak BELs. We compare
their properties with those of the other less-extreme candidates. We then
compare the distributions of bolometric luminosities and accretion rates of
these objects with theoretical models that predict weak BELs.

which complements observations along more abundant quasar lines-of-sight.
Although both quasars and GRB afterglows should provide a-priori random
sight-lines through the intervening IGM, it has been observed that strong Mg-II
absorbers are twice as likely to be found along sight-lines toward GRBs.
Several proposals to reconcile this discrepancy have been put forward, but none
has been found sufficient to explain the magnitude of the effect. In this paper
we estimate the effect of gravitational lensing by galaxies and their
surrounding mass distributions on the statistics of Mg-II absorption. We find
that the multi-band magnification bias could be very strong in the
spectroscopic GRB afterglow population and that gravitational lensing can
explain the discrepancy in density of absorbers, for plausibly steep luminosity
functions. The model makes the prediction that approximately 20%-60% of the
spectroscopic afterglow sample (i.e. ~ 5-15 of 26 sources) would have been
multiply imaged, and hence result in repeating bursts. We show that despite
this large lensing fraction it is likely that none would yet have been
identified by chance owing to the finite sky coverage of GRB searches. We
predict that continued optical monitoring of the bright GRB afterglow locations
in the months and years following the initial decay would lead to
identification of lensed GRB afterglows. A confirmation of the lensing
hypothesis would allow us to constrain the GRB luminosity function down to
otherwise inaccessibly faint levels, with potential consequences for GRB
models.

hemispheres on two important parameters, the turbulent diffusivity and the

the flux-transport dynamo model. It is known that the coupling of the magnetic
field between hemispheres due to turbulent diffusivity is an important factor
for the solar parity issue, but the detailed criterion for the generation of
the dipole field has not been investigated. Our conclusions are as follows. (1)
The stronger diffusivity near the surface is more likely to cause the magnetic
field to be a dipole. (2) The thinner layer of the strong diffusivity near the
surface is also more apt to generate a dipolar magnetic field. (3) The faster
meridional flow is more prone to cause the magnetic field to be a quadrupole,
i.e., symmetric about the equator. These results show that turbulent
diffusivity and meridional flow are crucial for the configuration of the solar
global magnetic field.

peaked BL Lac H 2356-309 (z=0.165) are investigated. METHODS: Very High Energy
(VHE; E > 100 GeV) observations of H 2356-309 were performed with the High
Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) from 2004 through 2007. Simultaneous
optical/UV and X-ray observations were made with the XMM-Newton satellite on
June 12/13 and June 14/15, 2005. NRT radio observations were also
contemporaneously performed in 2005. ATOM optical monitoring observations were
also made in 2007. RESULTS: A strong VHE signal, ~13 sigma total, was detected
by HESS after the four years HESS observations (116.8 hrs live time). The
integral flux above 240 GeV is I(>240 GeV) = (3.06 +- 0.26 {stat} +- 0.61
{syst}) x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponding to ~1.6% of the flux observed
from the Crab Nebula. A time-averaged energy spectrum is measured from 200 GeV
to 2 TeV and is characterized by a power law (photon index of Gamma = 3.06 +-
0.15 {stat} +- 0.10 {syst}). Significant small-amplitude variations in the VHE
flux from H 2356-309 are seen on time scales of months and years, but not on
shorter time scales. No evidence for any variations in the VHE spectral slope
are found within these data. The XMM-Newton X-ray measurements show a
historically low X-ray state, characterized by a hard, broken-power-law
spectrum on both nights. CONCLUSIONS: The broad-band spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the blazar can be adequately fit using a simple one-zone
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. In the SSC scenario, higher VHE fluxes
could be expected in the future since the observed X-ray flux is at a
historically low level.

mapping survey of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the Large and Small
Magellanic Clouds using the Mopra Telescope. Here we report on the basic
physical properties of 125 GMCs in the LMC that have been surveyed to date. The
observed clouds exhibit scaling relations that are similar to those determined
for Galactic GMCs, although LMC clouds have narrower linewidths and lower CO
luminosities than Galactic clouds of a similar size. The average mass surface
density of the LMC clouds is 50 Msol/pc2, approximately half that of GMCs in
the inner Milky Way. We compare the properties of GMCs with and without signs
of massive star formation, finding that non-star-forming GMCs have lower peak
CO brightness than star-forming GMCs. We compare the properties of GMCs with
estimates for local interstellar conditions: specifically, we investigate the
HI column density, radiation field, stellar mass surface density and the
external pressure. Very few cloud properties demonstrate a clear dependence on
the environment; the exceptions are significant positive correlations between
i) the HI column density and the GMC velocity dispersion, ii) the stellar mass
surface density and the average peak CO brightness, and iii) the stellar mass
surface density and the CO surface brightness. The molecular mass surface
density of GMCs without signs of massive star formation shows no dependence on
the local radiation field, which is inconsistent with the
photoionization-regulated star formation theory proposed by McKee (1989). We
find some evidence that the mass surface density of the MAGMA clouds increases
with the interstellar pressure, as proposed by Elmegreen (1989), but the
detailed predictions of this model are not fulfilled once estimates for the
local radiation field, metallicity and GMC envelope mass are taken into
account.

to gene tree analysis for example, detecting unusual events in genome evolution
such as horizontal gene transfer and reshuffling. Our method uses difference of
means to compare two distributions of trees, after embedding trees in a vector
space. Bootstrapping alignment columns can then be applied to obtain p-values.
To compute distances between means, we employ a ""kernel trick"" which speeds up
distance calculations when trees are embedded in a high-dimensional feature
space, e.g. splits or quartets feature space. In this pilot study, first we
test our statistical method's ability to distinguish between sets of gene trees
generated under coalescence models with species trees of varying dissimilarity.

broad-band SED and the rest-frame optical spectrum we derive a

z_form~2.5-4, and a stellar mass of M_star~(3-4)x10^{11} M_sun. This is in
agreement with a virial mass limit of M_vir<7x10^{11}M_sun, derived from the

dynamical mass limit based on the Jeans equations. In contrast with previously
reported super-dense passive galaxies at z~2, the present galaxy at z=1.82
appears to have both size and velocity dispersion similar to early-type

arcmin, ~0.6 pc at a distance of 460 pc) in the spectral range 6500-7000 \AA.
We built emission-line intensity maps of H$\alpha$, [NII] and [SII] and of
their radial velocity channels. Furthermore, we analysed the spatial
distribution of the excitation and electron density from [NII]/H$\alpha$,
[SII]/H$\alpha$, and [SII] 6716/6731 integrated line-ratio maps, as well as
their behaviour as a function of velocity, from line-ratio channel maps. Our
results fully reproduce the morphology and kinematics obtained from previous
imaging and long-slit data. In addition, the IFS data revealed, for the first
time, the complex spatial distribution of the physical conditions (excitation
and density) in the whole jet, and their behaviour as a function of the
kinematics. The results here derived give further support to the more recent
model simulations that involve deflection of a pulsed jet propagating in an
inhomogeneous ambient medium. The IFS data give richer information than that
provided by current model simulations or laboratory jet experiments. Hence,
they could provide valuable clues to constrain the space parameters in future

source. Deep observations at VHE energies (above 100 GeV) were carried out with
the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) of Cherenkov Telescopes from
2003 to 2008. More than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected to
an improved analysis procedure. Observations resulted in the detection of VHE
gamma-rays from SN 1006. The measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with a
power-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the Crab
Nebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established H.E.S.S. upper
limit. The source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlated
with non-thermal X-rays. Because the thickness of the VHE-shell is compatible
with emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likely
to be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. The measured flux level can be
accounted for by inverse Compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includes
leptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matter
density inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description of
the multi-wavelength spectrum.

  This paper deals with the dynamics of actions of BS(1,n) on closed orientable
surfaces. We exhibit a smooth BS(1,n) action without finite orbits on $\TT ^2$,
we study the dynamical behavior of it and of its $C^1$-pertubations and we
prove that it is not locally rigid.
  We develop a general dynamical study for faithful topological BS(1,n)-actions
on closed surfaces $S$. We prove that such actions $<f,h \ | \ h \circ f \circ
h^{-1} = f^n>$ admit a minimal set included in $fix(f)$, the set of fixed
points of $f$, provided that $fix(f)$ is not empty.
  When $S= \TT^2$, we show that there exists a positive integer $N$, such that
$fix(f^N)$ is non-empty and contains a minimal set of the action. As a
corollary, we get that there are no minimal faithful topological actions of
BS(1,n) on $\TT^2$.
  When the surface $S$ has genus at least 2, is closed and orientable, and $f$
is isotopic to identity, then $fix(f)$ is non empty and contains a minimal set
of the action. Moreover if the action is $C^1$ then $fix(f)$ contains any

We further discuss how to manipulate spin in these quantum dots and explain the
mechanism of spin decoherence and relaxation caused by spin-orbit interaction

Ag doped samples. These results clearly suggest that annealing at ~900C is

the external driving force, making it different from stochastic resonance.
Numerical simulations and an analytical theory of a stochastic dynamical

ubiquity and robustness of this phenomenon, which is argued to be a possible
cause of excess volatility in financial markets, of enhanced effective

single experimental time series into an ensemble of data segments of equal
length. Such single trajectory ensemble (STE) is a counterpart to a multiple
trajectory ensemble (MTE) used whenever independent measurements or
realizations of a stochastic process are available. The equivalence of STE and
MTE for stationary systems was postulated by Wang and Uhlenbeck in their
classic paper on Brownian motion (Rev. Mod. Phys. 17, 323 (1945)) but
surprisingly has not yet been proved. Using the stationary and ergodic paradigm
of statistical physics -- the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) Langevin equation, we
revisit Wang and Uhlenbeck's postulate. In particular, we find that the
variance of the solution of this equation is different for these two ensembles.
While the variance calculated using the MTE quantifies the spreading of
independent trajectories originating from the same initial point, the variance
for STE measures the spreading of two correlated random walkers. Thus, STE and
MTE refer to two completely different dynamical processes. Guided by this
interpretation, we introduce a novel algorithm of partitioning a single
trajectory into a phenomenological ensemble, which we name a threshold
trajectory ensemble (TTE), that for an ergodic system is equivalent to MTE. We
find that in the cohort of healthy volunteers, the ratio of STE and TTE
asymptotic variances of stage 4 sleep electroencephalogram is equal to 1.96 \pm
0.04 which is in agreement with the theoretically predicted value of 2.

allowing residual motions to persist without dissipation in the flux-freezing

proofs, different from that given in [BIKPRS96,GH03]. We then turn to an
apparently weaker system, namely, polynomial calculus (PC) where polynomials
are written as ordered formulas (PC over ordered formulas, for short): an
ordered polynomial is a noncommutative polynomial in which the order of
products in every monomial respects a fixed linear order on variables; an
algebraic formula is ordered if the polynomial computed by each of its
subformulas is ordered. We show that PC over ordered formulas is strictly
stronger than resolution, polynomial calculus and polynomial calculus with
resolution (PCR) and admits polynomial-size refutations for the pigeonhole
principle and the Tseitin's formulas. We conclude by proposing an approach for
establishing lower bounds on PC over ordered formulas proofs, and related
systems, based on properties of lower bounds on noncommutative formulas.

trends as a function of charge doping and pressure in BaFe$_2$As$_2$, and
compare to experimentally established facts. We find that density functional
theory, while accurately reproducing the structural and magnetic ordering at
ambient pressure, fails to reproduce some structural trends as pressure is
increased. Most notably, the Fe-As bondlength which is a gauge of the magnitude
of the magnetic moment, $\mu$, is rigid in experiment, but soft in calculation,
indicating residual local Coulomb interactions. By calculating the magnitude of
the magnetic ordering energy, we show that the disruption of magnetic order as
a function of pressure or doping can be qualitatively reproduced, but that in
calculation, it is achieved through diminishment of $|\mu|$, and therefore
likely does not reflect the same physics as detected in experiment. We also
find that the strength of the stripe order as a function of doping is strongly
site-dependent: magnetism decreases monotonically with the number of electrons
doped at the Fe site, but increases monotonically with the number of electrons
doped at the Ba site. Intra-planar magnetic ordering energy (the difference
between checkerboard and stripe orderings) and interplanar coupling both follow
a similar trend. We also investigate the evolution of the orthorhombic
distortion, $e=(a-b)/(a+b),$ as a function of $\mu$, and find that in the
regime where experiment finds a linear relationship, our calculations are
impossible to converge, indicating that in density functional theory, the
transition is first order, signalling anomalously large higher order terms in
the Landau functional.

to verify the presence and possible flux variations of its broad Ha line. We
used the spectroscopic information also to investigate the question of its
parent population. Four spectra were acquired at the TNG in 2007-2008, when the
source was in a relatively faint state. In three cases we were able to measure
the broad Ha and several narrow emission lines. A comparison with previous
results suggests that the broad Ha has increased by ~50% in ten years, a change
not unusual for Broad Lined AGN. We estimated a black hole mass for BL Lac of
4-6 10^8 solar masses from its relation with the bulge luminosity. The virial
mass estimated from the spectroscopic data is instead 20-30 times smaller. We
suggest that this discrepancy is due to the BL Lac BLR being underluminous.
Finally, we addressed the problem of the BL Lac parent population, comparing
its isotropic quantities with those of other AGN classes. From the point of
view of the narrow emission line spectrum, the source locates close to
low-excitation radio galaxies. When also considering its diffuse radio power,
an association with FRI radio galaxies is severely questioned due to the lower
radio luminosity (at give line luminosity) of BL Lac. The narrow line and radio
luminosities of BL Lac instead match those of a sample of miniature radio
galaxies, which however do not show a BLR. Yet, if existing, ""misaligned BL
Lac"" objects should have entered that sample. We also rule out the possibility
that they have been excluded because of a QSO optical appearance. The
observational constraints suggest that BL Lac is caught in a short term
transient stage, which does not leave a detectable evolutionary ""trace"" in the
AGN population. We speculate on a scenario that can account for the observed
properties. [ABRIDGED]

Krori and Barua's method to include pressure anisotropy and linear or
non-linear equations of state. The field equations are reduced to a system of
three algebraic equations for the anisotropic pressures as well as matter and
electrostatic energy densities. Attention is paid to compact sources
characterized by positive matter density and positive radial pressure. Arising
solutions satisfy the energy conditions of general relativity. Spheres with
vanishing net charge contain fluid elements with unbounded proper charge
density located at the fluid-vacuum interface. Notably the electric force
acting on these fluid elements is finite, although the acting electric field is
zero. Net charges can be huge ($10^{19}\,C$) and maximum electric field
intensities are very large ($10^{23}-10^{24}\,statvolt/cm$) even in the case of
zero net charge. Inward-directed fluid forces caused by pressure anisotropy may
allow equilibrium configurations with larger net charges and electric field
intensities than those found in studies of charged isotropic fluids. Links of
these results with charged strange quark stars as well as models of dark matter
including massive charged particles are highlighted. The van der Waals equation
of state leading to matter densities constrained by cubic polynomial equations

test-bed for methods aimed at obtaining accurate time-domain relative
photometry within highly crowded fields. Difference imaging methods, originally
pioneered towards M31, have evolved into sophisticated methods, such as the
Optimal Image Subtraction (OIS) method of Alard & Lupton (1998), that today are
most widely used to survey variable stars, transients and microlensing events
in our own Galaxy. We show that modern difference image (DIA) algorithms such
as OIS, whilst spectacularly successful towards the Milky Way bulge, may
perform badly towards high surface brightness targets such as the M31 bulge.
Poor results can occur in the presence of common systematics which add spurious
flux contributions to images, such as internal reflections, scattered light or
fringing. Using data from the Angstrom Project microlensing survey of the M31
bulge, we show that very good results are usually obtainable by first
performing careful photometric alignment prior to using OIS to perform
point-spread function (PSF) matching. This separation of background matching
and PSF matching, a common feature of earlier M31 photometry techniques, allows
us to take full advantage of the powerful PSF matching flexibility offered by
OIS towards high surface brightness targets. We find that difference images
produced this way have noise distributions close to Gaussian, showing
significant improvement upon results achieved using OIS alone. We show that
with this correction light-curves of variable stars and transients can be
recovered to within ~10 arcseconds of the M31 nucleus. Our method is simple to
implement and is quick enough to be incorporated within real-time DIA
pipelines. (Abridged)

arbitrary positive integer. In particular, for m>1, say, $m=bu^2$, where b is

the configurations produced are self-avoiding trails. We show that the scaling
behaviour of this process is similar to the analogous process on the square
lattice. However, while the square lattice process maps to the collapse
transition of the canonical interacting self-avoiding trail model (ISAT) on
that lattice, the process on the triangular lattice model does not map to the
canonical equilibrium model. On the other hand, we show that the collapse
transition of the canonical ISAT model on the triangular lattice behaves in a
way reminiscent of the $\theta$-point of the interacting self-avoiding walk
model (ISAW), which is the standard model of polymer collapse. This implies an
unusual lattice dependency of the ISAT collapse transition in two dimensions.
  By studying an extended ISAT model, we demonstrate that the growth process
maps to a multi-critical point in a larger parameter space. In this extended
parameter space the collapse phase transition may be either $\theta$-point-like
(second-order) or first-order, and these two are separated by a multi-critical
point. It is this multi-critical point to which the growth process maps.
Furthermore, we provide evidence that in addition to the high-temperature
gas-like swollen polymer phase (coil) and the low-temperature liquid drop-like
collapse phase (globule) there is also a maximally dense crystal-like phase
(crystal) at low temperatures dependent on the parameter values. The
multi-critical point is the meeting point of these three phases. Our
hypothesised phase diagram resolves the mystery of the seemingly differing
behaviours of the ISAW and ISAT models in two dimensions as well as the
behaviour of the trail growth process.

divided into a group with flaring circumstellar disks (group I) and a group
with flat circumstellar disks (group II). Dust sedimentation is generally
proposed as an evolution mechanism to transform flaring disks into flat disks.
Theory predicts that during this process the disks preserve their gas content,
however observations of group II Herbig Ae stars demonstrate a lack of gas.
Aims. We map the spatial distribution of the gas and dust around the group II
Herbig Ae star HD 95881. Methods. We analyze optical photometry, Q-band
imaging, infrared spectroscopy, and K and N-band interferometric spectroscopy.
We use a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to create a model for the density
and temperature structure which quite accurately reproduces all the
observables. Results. We derive a consistent picture in which the disk consists
of a thick puffed up inner rim and an outer region which has a flaring gas
surface and is relatively void of 'visible' dust grains. Conclusions. HD 95881

the lower term of the transition (b $^4$F, a $^6$S and a $^4$G terms). These
correspond approximately to the blue, central, and red part respectively of the
""iron shelf"" around Hb. We calculate an Fe II template which takes into account
transitions into these three terms and an additional group of lines, based on a
reconstruction of the spectrum of I Zw 1. This Fe II template gives a more
precise fit of the Fe II lines in broad-line AGNs than other templates. We
extract Fe II, Ha, Hb, [O III] and [N II] emission parameters and investigate
correlations between them. We find that Fe II lines probably originate in an
Intermediate Line Region. We notice that the blue, red, and central parts of
the iron shelf have different relative intensities in different objects. Their
ratios depend on continuum luminosity, FWHM Hb, the velocity shift of Fe II,
and the Ha/Hb flux ratio. We examine the dependence of the well-known
anti-correlation between the equivalent widths of Fe II and [O III] on
continuum luminosity. We find that there is a Baldwin effect for [O III] but an
inverse Baldwin effect for the Fe II emission. The [O III]/Fe II ratio thus
decreases with L\lambda5100. Since the ratio is a major component of the
Boroson and Green eigenvector 1, this implies a connection between the Baldwin
effect and eigenvector 1, and could be connected with AGN evolution. We find
that spectra are different for Hb FWHMs greater and less than ~3000 km/s, and
that there are different correlation coefficients between the parameters.

frequencies of the Sun can be approximated by a power law. We show that when
this empirical law is employed to correct the model frequencies and then the
small frequency separations are used for solar age determination, the results
are consistent with the meteoritic age (4.563 Gyr < t < 4.576 Gyr). We present
the results and compare with those obtained by using the ratios of small to

microcavity polariton bosonic Josephson junction. The condensation of exciton
polaritons takes place under incoherent excitation in a disordered environment,
where double potential wells tend to appear in the disordered landscape.
Coherent oscillations set on at an excitation power well above the condensation
threshold. The time resolved population and phase dynamics reveal the analogy
with the AC Josephson effect. We have introduced a theoretical two-mode model
to describe the observed effects, which allows us to explain how the different
realizations of the pulsed experiment have a similar phase relation.

over a 4.5'x5.4' region were made in a frequency window around 338 GHz,
covering the 7-6 transitions of methanol. Emission is extended over each
source, following the column density of H2 but showing up also particularly
strongly around outflows. The rotational temperature is low, 15-20 K, and does
not vary with position within each source. The abundance is typically 10^-9 -
10^-8 with respect to H2 in the outer envelope, whereas ""jumps"" by factors of
up to 10^2 -10^3 inside the region where the dust temperature exceeds 100 K are
not excluded. A factor of up to ~ 10^3 enhancement is seen in outflow gas. In
one object, SMM4, the ice abundance has been measured to be ~ 3x10^-5 with
respect to H2 in the outer envelope, i.e., a factor of 10^3 larger than the
gas-phase abundance. Comparison with C18O J=3-2 emission shows that strong CO
depletion leads to a high gas-phase abundance of CH3OH not just for the Serpens
sources, but for a larger sample of protostars. The observations illustrate the
large-scale, low-level desorption of CH3OH from dust grains, extending out to
and beyond 7500 AU from each source, a scenario which is consistent with
non-thermal (photo-)desorption from the ice. The observations also illustrate
the usefulness of CH3OH as a tracer of energetic input in the form of outflows,
where methanol is sputtered from the grain surfaces. Finally, the observations
provide further evidence of CH3OH formation through CO hydrogenation proceeding
on grain surfaces in low-mass envelopes.

and crystal-field strengths in rare-earth $4f$ electron systems, according to
which the first should be one order of magnitude larger that the second. We
find it difficult to reconcile the standard values of crystal field strength
with the Single Ion Model of magnetic anisotropy. If in rare-earth systems the
spin-orbit force is much larger than the crystal field, however, spin and orbit
of $4f$ electrons should be locked to each other. For rare earths with
non-vanishing spin, an applied magnetic field should rotate both spin and
charge density profile. We suggest experiments to investigate the possible
occurrence of such Spin-Orbit Locking, thus making a test of the standard
picture, by studying the Scissors Modes in such systems.

the vanishing of the averaged gap does not identify the transition. A power-law
form of the gap distribution function leads to power-law distributions of the
linear, spin-glass, and nonlinear susceptibilities. They diverge at different
points, which we attribute to a quantum Griffiths mechanism. On the other hand,
the classical treatment is justified for the transverse random energy model and
the phase transition can be found by a sudden change of the ground state.

ratio between the shortest lifetimes of particles, decaying by the
electromagnetic and strong interactions. The inherent property of each
fundamental interaction is defined, namely the Minimal lifetime of the
interaction (MLTI). The rest mass of the Lightest free massive stable particle
(LFMSP), acted upon by a particular interaction, is shown to be inversely
proportional to MLTI. The found mass relation unifies the masses of four stable
particles of completely different kinds (proton, electron, electron neutrino
and graviton) and covers an extremely wide range of values, exceeding 40 orders
of magnitude. On the basis of this mass relation, the electron neutrino and
graviton masses have been approximately estimated to 6.5x10^(-4) eV/c^2 and
H*h_bar/c^2 = 1.5x10^(-33) eV/c^2, respectively. Besides, the last value has
been obtained independently by dimensional analysis by means of the fundamental
parameters speed of light (c), reduced Planck constant (h_bar) and Hubble
distance (H). It was shown that the equivalent energy of LFMSP, acted upon by a
particular interaction, is close to Breit-Wigner's energy width of the shortest
living state, decaying by the respective interaction.
