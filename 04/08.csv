frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the two dimensional (2D) honeycomb
lattice. The classical $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the two dimensional (2D)
honeycomb lattice has N\'eel order for $J_2 < J_1/6$. For $J_2 > J_1/6$, it
exhibits a one-parameter family of degenerate incommensurate spin spiral ground
states where the spiral wave vector can point in any direction. Spin wave
fluctuations at leading order lift this accidental degeneracy in favor of
specific wave vectors, leading to spiral order by disorder. For spin $S=1/2$,
quantum fluctuations are, however, likely to be strong enough to melt the
spiral order parameter over a wide range of $J_2/J_1$. Over a part of this
range, we argue that the resulting state is a valence bond solid (VBS) with
staggered dimer order - this VBS is a nematic which breaks lattice rotational
symmetry. Our arguments are supported by comparing the spin wave energy with
the energy of the dimer solid obtained using a bond operator formalism. Turning
to the effect of thermal fluctuations on the spiral ordered state, any nonzero
temperature destroys the magnetic order, but the discrete rotational symmetry
of the lattice remains broken resulting in a thermal analogue of the nematic
VBS. We present arguments, supported by classical Monte Carlo simulations, that
this nematic transforms into the high temperature symmetric paramagnet via a
thermal phase transition which is in the universality class of the classical
3-state Potts (clock) model in 2D. We discuss the possible relevance of our
results for honeycomb magnets, such as Bi$_3$M$_4$O$_{12}$(NO$_3$) (with
M=Mn,V,Cr), and bilayer triangular lattice magnets.

  Despite of the strong restrictions it breaks the essential simplicity

Introducing the third degree of freedom by breaking a continuous symmetry, we
first explore the topological structure of the homoclinic/heteroclinic tangle
and the structures in the scattering functions. Then we work out implications
of these structures for the doubly differential cross section. The most
prominent structures in the cross section are rainbow singularities. They form
a fractal pattern which reflects the fractal structure of the chaotic invariant
set. This allows to determine structures in the cross section from the
invariant set and conversely, to obtain information about the topology of the
invariant set from the cross section. The latter is a contribution to the
inverse scattering problem for chaotic systems.

several absorption line groups spanning a range of about 3,000 km/s in velocity
relative to the redshift of the host galaxy. The absorption profiles are very
complex with both velocity-broadened components extending over several 100 km/s
and narrow lines with velocity widths of only 20 km/s. By analogy with QSO
absorption line studies, the relative velocities,widths, and degrees of
ionization of the lines (""line-locking"", ""ionization--velocity correlation"")

several distinct mass loss phases (winds). These results are consistent with
GRB progenitors being massive stars, such as Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) or

Time correlation functions have been measured at different temperatures and
momentum transfers (q) and under different illumination conditions (darkness,
UV or visible). The correlation functions are well described by the
Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) form with relaxation times that are
proportional to q^-1, which in other systems have been explained in terms of
intermittent rearrangements [L. Cipelletti et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 84,
2275-2278 (2000)] or random dipolar interactions within an elastic medium [J.-
P. Bouchaud and E. Pitard, Eur. Phys. J. E 6, 231-236 (2001)]. The
characteristic relaxation times follow the well known Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann law
describing the temperature dependence of the bulk viscosity of this polymer. UV
photoperturbation accelerates the relaxation dynamics, in qualitative agreement
with the fluidification effect of UV photo-perturbation previously observed by
surface rheometry, and is used to drive the system out of equilibrium.
Transient dynamics is characterized, by the variance chi of the two-times
correlation functions. A clear peak in chi appears at a well defined time tau_C
which scales with q^-1 and with the ageing time, in a similar fashion as
previously reported in colloidal suspensions [O. Dauchot et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 95, 265701 (2005)]. From an accurate analysis of the correlation
functions we could demonstrate a temperature dependent cross-over from KWW
compressed to simple exponential behaviour, which is modified by the
fluidification due to the optical pumping of the cis-trans isomerisation of the
side-chain azobenzene group.

conclusion is that the strictest constraints from the RM effect are expected
for the radius of the moon. In some cases there is also meaningful information
on its orbital period. When the transit time of the moon is exactly known, for
example, from transit photometry, the angle parameters of the moon's orbit will
also be constrained from the RM effect. From transit light curves the mass can
be determined, and combining this result with the radius from the RM effect,
the experimental determination of the density of the moon is also possible.

from complex numerical models that produce concentration surfaces over large

fusing these two sources of information for the pair of co-pollutants which is
computationally feasible over large spatial regions and long periods of time.
Due to the association between concentration levels of the two environmental
contaminants, it is expected that information regarding one will help to
improve prediction of the other. Misalignment is an obvious issue since the
monitoring networks for the two contaminants only partly intersect and because
the collection rate for PM2.5 is typically less frequent than that for ozone.

downscaler that provides a flexible class of bivariate space-time assimilation
models. We discuss computational issues for model fitting and analyze a dataset

reconnection at the merging points, or the `anti-reconnection', which is, in a
sense, driven by the converging outflows from the initial magnetic reconnection
regions. By following the trajectories of the most energetic electrons, we
found a variety of different acceleration mechanisms but the energization at

possible applications to the energetic electrons observed in the solar flares.

parameters, the Kaluza-Klein (KK) mass scale, the relative coupling of the KK
gauge fields to the Higgs and the relative coupling of the KK gauge fields to
fermion zero modes. It is found that 5D spaces that resolve the hierarchy
problem through warping typically have large gauge-Higgs coupling. It is also
found in $D>5$ where the additional dimensions are warped the relative
gauge-Higgs coupling scales as a function of the warp factor. If the warp
factor of the additional spaces is contracting towards the IR brane, both the
relative gauge-Higgs coupling and resulting EW corrections will be large.
Conversely EW constraints could be reduced by finding a space where the
additional dimension's warp factor is increasing towards the IR brane. We
demonstrate that the Klebanov Strassler solution belongs to the former of these
possibilities.

shock heated to the virial temperature of the halo. In low mass haloes, or at
high redshift, however, the gas cooling rate is sufficiently rapid that an
accretion shock is unlikely to form. Instead, gas can accrete directly into the
centre of the halo in a `cold mode' of accretion. Although semi-analytic models
have always made a clear distinction between hydrostatic and rapid cooling they
have not made a distinction between whether or not an accretion shock forms.
Starting from the well-established Galform code, we investigate the effect of
explicitly accounting for cold mode accretion using the shock stability model
of Birnboim & Dekel. When we modify the code so that there is no effective
feedback from galaxy formation, we find that cold mode accretion is the
dominant channel for feeding gas into the galaxies at high redshifts. However,
this does not translate into a significant difference in the star formation
history of the universe compared to the previous code. When effective feedback
is included in the model, we find that the the cold mode is much less apparent
because of the presence of gas ejected from the galaxy. Thus the inclusion of
the additional cold mode physics makes little difference to basic results from
earlier semi-analytic models which used a simpler treatment of gas accretion.
For more sophisticated predictions of its consequences, we require a better
understanding of how the cold mode delivers angular momentum to galaxies and
how it interacts with outflows.

mere background light sources which are uncorrelated with the forest.
Gravitational lensing of the quasars violates this assumption. This effect
leads to a measurement bias, but more interestingly it provides a valuable
signal. The lensing signal can be extracted by correlating quasar magnitudes
with the flux power spectrum and with the flux decrement. These correlations
will be challenging to measure but their detection provides a direct measure of
how features in the Lyman-alpha forest trace the underlying mass density field.
Observing them will test the fundamental hypothesis that fluctuations in the
forest are predominantly driven by fluctuations in mass, rather than in the
ionizing background, helium reionization or winds. We discuss ways to
disentangle the lensing signal from other sources of such correlations,
including dust, continuum and background residuals. The lensing-induced
measurement bias arises from sample selection: one preferentially collects
spectra of magnified quasars which are behind overdense regions. This
measurement bias is ~0.1-1% for the flux power spectrum, optical depth and the
flux probability distribution. Since the effect is systematic, quantities such
as the amplitude of the flux power spectrum averaged across scales should be
interpreted with care.

varies from retrograde to prograde with respect to the accreting material.
Unlike the current view, according to which jet powers decrease in tandem with
a global downsizing effect, we argue for a drop in jet power resulting directly
from the paucity of retrograde accretion systems at lower redshift $z$ caused
by a continuous history of accretion dating back to higher $z$. In addition,
the model provides simple interpretations for the basic spectral features
differentiating radio-loud and radio-quiet objects, such as the presence or
absence of disk reflection, broadened iron lines and signatures of disk winds.
We also briefly describe our models' interpretation of microquasar state
transitions. We highlight our result that the most radio-loud and most

phase-shifts occurring at the interface qualitatively modifies the density of
states. In particular, we find that the proximity-induced pairing amplitudes in
the normal metal region undergo a conversion at the Fermi level from pure
even-frequency to odd-frequency. Above a critical value of the interface
spin-polarization (or, equivalently, for fixed interface spin-polarization,
above a critical interface resistance), only odd frequency correlations remain.
This is accompanied by the replacement of the familiar proximity minigap or
pseudogap in the normal layer by an enhancement of the density of states above
its normal state value for energies near the chemical potential. The robustness
of this effect towards inelastic scattering, impurity scattering, and the
depletion of the superconducting order parameter close to the interface is
investigated. We also study the inverse proximity effect in the diffusive
limit. We find that the above-mentioned conversion persists also for thin
superconducting layers comparable in size to the superconducting coherence
length $\xi_\text{S}$, as long as the inverse proximity effect is relatively
weak. Concomitantly, we find a shift in the critical interface resistance where

right handed (RH) neutrinos. During the early universe, for T>TeV, part of the
symmetry is restored, due to finite temperature contributions, and the RH
neutrinos remain massless and can be produced in thermal equilibrium even at
temperatures well below the most conservative gravitino bounds. Below this
temperature the phase transition occurs and they become massive, decaying out
of equilibrium and producing the necessary lepton asymmetry. Unless the
symmetry is broken explicitly by Planck-suppressed terms, the domain walls
generated by the symmetry breaking survive till the quark-hadron phase
transition, where they disappear due to a small energy splitting between
different vacua caused by the QCD anomaly.

distribution on smaller scales (Delta-z ~0.01) indicating that smaller scale
voids may connect regions separated by several degrees towards the cold spot. A

temperature real-time field theory formalism to compute 3-point correlators of

temperature. To this end, we propose that the gravity field action is
integrated only over the right and left quadrants of the Penrose diagram of the
Anti de Sitter-Schwarzschild background, with a relative sign between the two
terms. For concreteness we consider the case of a scalar field in the black
hole background. Using the scalar field Schwinger-Keldysh bulk-to-boundary
propagators, we give the general expression of a 3-point real-time Green's
correlator. We then note that this particular prescription amounts to adapting
the finite-temperature analog of Veltman's circling rules to tree-level Witten
diagrams, and comment on the retarded and Feynman scalar bulk-to-boundary
propagators. We subject our prescription to several checks: KMS identities, the
largest time equation and the zero-temperature limit. When specializing to a
particular retarded (causal) 3-point function, we find a very simple answer:
the momentum-space correlator is given by three causal (two retarded and one
advanced) bulk-to-boundary propagators, meeting at a vertex point which is
integrated from spatial infinity to the horizon only. This result is expected
based on analyticity, since the retarded n-point functions are obtained by
analytic continuation from the imaginary time Green's function, and based on
causality considerations.

depleted into grains, and that accretion shocks dominate the production of the
hot gas observed on 2MASS J12073346-3932539. We use the observed CIV luminosity
to constrain the mass accretion rate in this system. We use the kinematically
broadened H2 profile to confirm that the majority of the molecular emission
arises in the disk, measure the radius of the inner hole of the disk
(R_{hole}~3R_{*}), and constrain the physical conditions of the warm molecular
phase of the disk (T(H2)~2500-4000 K). A second, most likely unresolved H2
component is identified. This feature is either near the stellar surface in the
region of the accretion shock or in a molecular outflow, although the
possibility that this Jovian-like emission arises on the day-side disk of a 6

a similar haze in the gamma-ray. Several studies have modeled these hazes as
radiation from the leptonic byproducts of dark matter annihilations, and
arguably no convincing astrophysical alternative has been suggested. We discuss
the characteristics of astrophysical cosmic ray sources that could potentially
explain this microwave and gamma-ray emission. The most promising astrophysical
scenarios involve cosmic ray sources that are clustered such that many fall
within ~1 kpc of the Galactic Center. For example, we show that several hundred
Galactic Center supernovae in the last million years plus a diffusion-hardened
electron spectrum may be consistent with present constraints on this emission.
Alternatively, it could be due to a burst of activity probably associated with
Sagittarius A* occurring ~1 Myr ago and producing >10^51 erg in cosmic ray
electrons. Different models predict different trends for the spectral index of
the microwave and gamma-ray spectrum as a function of angle from the Galactic
Center that should be robust to cosmic ray propagation uncertainties. In
particular, if the haze is from dark matter annihilations, it should have a
very hard microwave and gamma-ray spectrum for which the spectral shape does
not change significantly with angle, which we argue would be difficult to
achieve with any astrophysical mechanism. Observations with the Planck and
Fermi satellites can distinguish between viable haze models using these
signatures.

either accreting matter from or merging with it. The failure to identify the
types of binaries which produce SNeIa is the ""progenitor problem"". Its solution
is required if we are to utilize the full potential of SNeIa to elucidate basic
cosmological and physical principles. In single-degenerate models, a WD
accretes and burns matter at high rates. Nuclear-burning WDs (NBWDs) with mass
close to M_C are hot and luminous, potentially detectable as supersoft x-ray
sources (SSSs). In previous work we showed that > 90-99% of the required number
of progenitors do not appear as SSSs during most of the crucial phase of mass
increase. The obvious implication is that double-degenerate (DD) binaries form
the main class of progenitors. We show in this paper, however, that many
binaries that later become DDs must pass through a long-lived NBWD phase during
which they are potentially detectable as SSSs. The paucity of SSSs is therefore
not a strong argument in favor of DD models. Those NBWDs that are the
progenitors of DD binaries are likely to appear as symbiotic binaries for
intervals > 10^6 years. In fact, symbiotic pre-DDs should be common, whether or
not the WDs eventually produce SNeIa. The key to solving the progenitor problem
lies in understanding the appearance of NBWDs. Most do not appear as SSSs most
of the time. We therefore consider the evolution of NBWDs to address the
question of what their appearance may be and how we can hope to detect them.

science in general, and in combinatorial pattern matching in particular. The
standard dynamic programming solution for this problem computes the

this date, this quadratic upper-bound has never been substantially improved for
general strings. However, there are known techniques for breaking this bound in
case the strings are known to compress well under a particular compression
scheme. The basic idea is to first compress the strings, and then to compute
the edit distance between the compressed strings. As it turns out, practically
all known o(N^2) edit-distance algorithms work, in some sense, under the same
paradigm described above. It is therefore natural to ask whether there is a
single edit-distance algorithm that works for strings which are compressed
under any compression scheme. A rephrasing of this question is to ask whether a
single algorithm can exploit the compressibility properties of strings under
any compression method, even if each string is compressed using a different
compression. In this paper we set out to answer this question by using straight
line programs. These provide a generic platform for representing many popular
compression schemes including the LZ-family, Run-Length Encoding, Byte-Pair
Encoding, and dictionary methods. For two strings of total length N having
straight-line program representations of total size n, we present an algorithm
running in O(nN log(N/n)) time for computing the edit-distance of these two
strings under any rational scoring function, and an O(n^{2/3}N^{4/3}) time

contact at the atomic scale. The roles of temperature, adhesive interactions
and atomic structure are studied for simple geometries. An elastic, crystalline
substrate contacts a rigid, atomically flat surface or a spherical tip. The
rigid surface is formed from a commensurate or incommensurate crystal or an
amorphous solid. Spherical tips are made by bending crystalline planes or
removing material outside a sphere. In continuum theory the fraction of
atomically flat surfaces that is in contact rises sharply from zero to unity
when a load is applied. This simple behavior is surprisingly difficult to
reproduce with atomic scale definitions of contact. Due to thermal
fluctuations, the number of atoms making contact at any instant rises linearly
with load over a wide range of loads. Pressures comparable to the ideal
hardness are needed to achieve full contact at typical temperatures. A simple
harmonic mean-field theory provides a quantitative description of this behavior
and explains why the instantaneous forces on atoms have a universal exponential
form. Contact areas are also obtained by counting the number of atoms with a
time-averaged repulsive force. For adhesive interactions, the resulting area is
nearly independent of temperature and averaging interval, but usually rises
from zero to unity over a range of pressures that is comparable to the ideal
hardness. The only exception is the case of two identical commensurate
surfaces. For nonadhesive surfaces, the mean pressure is repulsive if there is
any contact during the averaging interval $\Delta t$. The associated area is
very sensitive to $\Delta t$ and grows monotonically. Similar complications are
encountered in defining contact areas for spherical tips.

wind density and velocity fields were obtained from the recently developed
radiation-hydrodynamic models of Owen et al., that include stellar X-ray and
EUV irradiation of protoplanetary discs at various stages of clearing, from
primordial sources to inner hole sources of various hole sizes.
  Our models compare favourably with currently available observations, lending
support to an X-ray driven photoevaporation model for disc dispersal. In
particular, we find that X-rays drive a warm, predominantly neutral flow where
the OI 6300A line can be produced by neutral hydrogen collisional excitation.
Our models can, for the first time, provide a very good match to both
luminosities and profiles of the low-velocity component of the OI 6300A line

  We find that the OI 6300A and the NeII 12.8um lines are predominantly
produced in the X-ray-driven wind and thus appear blue-shifted by a few km/s
for some of the systems when observed at non-edge-on inclinations. We note
however that blue-shifts are only produced under certain conditions: X-ray
luminosity, spectral shape and inner hole size all affect the location of the
emitting region and the physical conditions in the wind. We caution therefore
that while a blueshifted line is a tell-tale sign of an outflow, the lack of a
blueshift should not be necessarily interpreted as a lack of outflow.

which is elongated in the direction of the first coordinate (the tube axis).
Inside the random tube, which is stationary and ergodic, non-interacting
particles move straight with constant speed. Upon hitting the tube walls, they
are reflected randomly, according to the cosine law: the density of the
outgoing direction is proportional to the cosine of the angle between this
direction and the normal vector. Steady state transport is studied by
introducing an open tube segment as follows: We cut out a large finite segment
of the tube with segment boundaries perpendicular to the tube axis. Particles
which leave this piece through the segment boundaries disappear from the
system. Through stationary injection of particles at one boundary of the
segment a steady state with non-vanishing stationary particle current is
maintained. We prove (i) that in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite open
piece the coarse-grained density profile inside the segment is linear, and (ii)
that the transport diffusion coefficient obtained from the ratio of stationary
current and effective boundary density gradient equals the diffusion
coefficient of a tagged particle in an infinite tube. Thus we prove Fick's law
and equality of transport diffusion and self-diffusion coefficients for quite
generic rough (random) tubes. We also study some properties of the crossing
time and compute the Milne extrapolation length in dependence on the shape of

supernova (SN). Optical V band photometry reveals a very steep brightness
decline between the plateau and nebular phases of ~4.5 mag, likely due to SN
2007od containing a low mass of 56Ni. The optical spectra show an evolution
from normal Type IIP with broad Halpha emission, to a complex, four component
Halpha emission profile exhibiting asymmetries caused by dust extinction after
day 232. This is similar to the spectral evolution of the Type IIn SN 1998S,
although no early-time narrow (~200 km s-1) Halpha component was present in SN
2007od. In both SNe, the intermediate-width Halpha emission components are
thought to arise in the interaction between the ejecta and its circumstellar
medium (CSM). SN 2007od also shows a mid-IR excess due to new dust. The
evolution of the Halpha profile and the presence of the mid-IR excess provide
strong evidence that SN 2007od formed new dust before day 232. Late-time
observations reveal a flattening of the visible lightcurve. This flattening is
a strong indication of the presence of a light echo, which likely accounts for
much of the broad, underlying Halpha component seen at late-times. We believe
the multi-peaked Halpha emission is consistent with the interaction of the
ejecta with a circumstellar ring or torus (for the inner components at \pm1500
km s-1), and a single blob or cloud of circumstellar material out of the plane
of the CSM ring (for the outer component at -5000 km s-1). The most probable
location for the formation of new dust is in the cool dense shell created by
the interaction between the expanding ejecta and its CSM. Monte Carlo radiative
transfer modeling of the dust emission from SN 2007od implies that up to 4x
10-4Msun of new dust has formed. This is similar to the amounts of dust formed
in other CCSNe such as SNe 1999em, 2004et, and 2006jc.

been a problem of great theoretical and practical importance in numerous
applications of imaging sciences. A specific solution to the problem of image
restoration is generally determined by the nature of degradation phenomenon as
well as by the statistical properties of measurement noises. The present study
is concerned with the case in which the images of interest are corrupted by
convolutional blurs and Poisson noises. To deal with such problems, there
exists a range of solution methods which are based on the principles
originating from the fixed-point algorithm of Richardson and Lucy (RL). In this
paper, we provide conceptual and experimental proof that such methods tend to
converge to sparse solutions, which makes them applicable only to those images
which can be represented by a relatively small number of non-zero samples in
the spatial domain. Unfortunately, the set of such images is relatively small,
which restricts the applicability of RL-type methods. On the other hand,
virtually all practical images admit sparse representations in the domain of a
properly designed linear transform. To take advantage of this fact, it is
therefore tempting to modify the RL algorithm so as to make it recover
representation coefficients, rather than the values of their associated image.
Such modification is introduced in this paper. Apart from the generality of its
assumptions, the proposed method is also superior to many established
reconstruction approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and computational
complexity. This and other conclusions of this study are validated through a
series of numerical experiments.

the noise sensitivity. We develop formal expressions for the MSE of \hxl, and
evaluate its worst-case formal noise sensitivity over all types of k-sparse
signals. The phase space 0 < \delta, \rho < 1 is partitioned by curve \rho =
\rhoMSE(\delta) into two regions. Formal noise sensitivity is bounded
throughout the region \rho < \rhoMSE(\delta) and is unbounded throughout the
region \rho > \rhoMSE(\delta). The phase boundary \rho = \rhoMSE(\delta) is
identical to the previously-known phase transition curve for equivalence of l1

describes the fundamental phase transitions both for the noiseless and noisy
cases. Extensive computational experiments validate the predictions of this
formalism, including the existence of game theoretical structures underlying
it. Underlying our formalism is the AMP algorithm introduced earlier by the

fully-developed turbulent channel flow at a fairly low Reynolds number. This is
a flow where diffusion plays a prominent role, and presents a challenge to the
nonlinear model investigated here. It is found that when $\alpha^{2}_{k}$ is
based on the mesh spacing, the NS-$\alpha$ model has a tendency to tilt
spanwise vorticity in the streamwise direction, leading to high skin friction.
This is due to interaction between the spanwise vorticity, the model, and the
streamwise streaks. To overcome this problem $\alpha^{2}_{k}$ is damped in the
streak affected region. Results overall demonstrate the potential of the model
to reproduce some features of the DNS (helicity statistics and small-scale
features), but more work is required before the full potential of the model can
be achieved. In addition to the channel flow investigation, a derivation of the
governing using Hamilton's principle is given. The derivation is intended to be
clear and accessible to a wide audience, and contains a new interpretation of

organize large image data sets efficiently and to support popular image access
mechanisms like Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR).Conventional database
systems are designed for managing textual and numerical data and retrieving
such data is often based on simple comparisons of text or numerical values.
However, this method is no longer adequate for images, since the digital
presentation of images does not convey the reality of images. Retrieval of
images become difficult when the database is very large. This paper addresses
such problems and presents a novel indexing technique, Feature Based Adaptive
Tolerance Tree (FATT), which is designed to bring an effective solution
especially for indexing large databases. The proposed indexing scheme is then
used along with a query by image content, in order to achieve the ultimate goal
from the user point of view that is retrieval of all relevant images. FATT
indexing technique, features of the image is extracted using 2-dimensional
discrete wavelet transform (2DDWT) and index code is generated from the
determinant value of the features. Multiresolution analysis technique using
2D-DWT can decompose the image into components at different scales, so that the
coarest scale components carry the global approximation information while the
finer scale components contain the detailed information. Experimental results
show that the FATT outperforms M-tree upto 200%, Slim-tree up to 120% and HCT
upto 89%. FATT indexing technique is adopted to increase the efficiently of
data storage and retrieval.

effect (IQHE) is investigated, considering a cleaved-edge overgrown (CEO)
sample as an experimentally realizable sharp edge system. We propose a set of
experiments to clarify the distinction between the large-sample limit when bulk
disorder defines the IQHE plateau width and the small-sample limit smaller than
the disorder correlation length, when self-consistent edge electrostatics
define the IQHE plateau width. The large-sample or bulk QH regime is described
by the usual localization picture, whereas the small-sample or edge regime is
discussed within the compressible/incompressible strips picture, known as the
screening theory of QH edges. Utilizing the unusually sharp edge profiles of
the CEO samples, a Hall bar design is proposed to manipulate the edge potential
profile from smooth to extremely sharp. By making use of a side-gate
perpendicular to the two dimensional electron system, it is shown that the
plateau widths can be changed or even eliminated altogether. Hence, the
visibility of IQHE is strongly influenced when adjusting the edge potential
profile and/or changing the dc current direction under high currents in the
non-linear transport regime. As a second investigation, we consider two
different types of ohmic contacts, namely highly transmitting (ideal) and
highly reflecting (non-ideal) contacts. We show that if the injection contacts
are non-ideal, however still ohmic, it is possible to measure directly the
non-quantized transport taking place at the bulk of the CEO samples. The
results of the experiments we propose will clarify the influence of the edge
potential profile and the quality of the contacts, under quantized Hall
conditions.

engineers. Accurate effort estimation is the state of art of software
engineering, effort estimation of software is the preliminary phase between the
client and the business enterprise. The relationship between the client and the
business enterprise begins with the estimation of the software. The credibility
of the client to the business enterprise increases with the accurate
estimation. Effort estimation often requires generalizing from a small number
of historical projects. Generalization from such limited experience is an
inherently under constrained problem. Accurate estimation is a complex process
because it can be visualized as software effort prediction, as the term
indicates prediction never becomes an actual. This work follows the basics of
the empirical software effort estimation models. The goal of this paper is to
study the empirical software effort estimation. The primary conclusion is that
no single technique is best for all situations, and that a careful comparison
of the results of several approaches is most likely to produce realistic
estimates.

magnetic pair-creation is possible if some fraction of the pairs are produced
with an outgoing momentum. By assuming that multiple magnetic field will affect
the local field near the stellar surface, we show a specific magnetic field
geometry near the stellar surface resulting in the outflow of the pairs.
Together with the fact that the electric field is weak below null charge
surface, the characteristic curvature photon energy emitted by incoming
particles, which were accelerated in the outer gap, decreases drastically to
$\sim 100$MeV near the stellar surface. We estimate the height measured from
the last-open field line, above which 100MeV photons is converted into pairs by
the magnetic pair-creation. We also show the resultant multiplicity due to the
magnetic pair-creation process could acquire $M_{e^{\pm}}\sim 10^4-10^5$. In
this model the fractional outer gap size is proportional to $P^{-1/2}$. The
predicted gamma-ray luminosity ($L_{\gamma}$) and the characteristic curvature
photon energy ($E_c$) emitted from the outer gap are proportional to
$B^2P^{-5/2}$ and $B^{3/4}P^{-1}$ respectively. This model also predicts that

Photometric Surveys. Luminosities are calculated for all age-dated clusters.
Ages of 324 and 1193 populous star clusters in the Small and the Large
Magellanic Cloud have been determined fitting Padova and Geneva isochrone
models to their resolved color-magnitude diagrams. The clusters cover an age
range between 10Myr and 1Gyr in each galaxy. For the SMC a constant distance
modulus of $(m-M)_0$ = 18.90 and a metallicity of Z = 0.004 were adopted. For
the LMC, we used a constant distance modulus of $(m-M)_0$ = 18.50 and a
metallicity of Z = 0.008. For both galaxies, we used a variable color excess to
derive the cluster ages. We find two periods of enhanced cluster formation in
both galaxies at 160Myr and 630Myr (SMC) and at 125Myr and 800Myr (LMC). We
present the spatially resolved recent star formation history of both Clouds
based on young star clusters. The first peak may have been triggered by a close
encounter between the SMC and the LMC. In both galaxies the youngest clusters
reside in the supergiant shells, giant shells, the inter-shell regions, and
toward regions with a high H$\alpha$ content, suggesting that their formation
is related to expansion and shell-shell interaction. Most of the clusters are
older than the dynamical age of the supergiant shells. No evidence for cluster
dissolution was found. Computed V band luminosities show a trend for fainter
magnitudes with increasing age as well as a trend for brighter magnitudes with
increasing apparent cluster radii.

on variable elimination. We define a syntactic transformation that suppresses
some variables from a B event model, in addition to a method that chooses
relevant variables according to a test purpose. We propose two methods to
compute an abstraction A of an initial model M. The first one computes A as a

abstraction process produces a finite state system. We apply this abstraction
computation to a Model Based Testing process.

  with heavy tails",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Branching Processes in a Random Environment (BPREs) $(Z_n:n\geq0)$ are a
generalization of Galton Watson processes where in each generation the
reproduction law is picked randomly in an i.i.d. manner. We determine here the
upper large deviation of the process when the reproduction law may have heavy
tails. The behavior of BPREs is related to the associated random walk of the
environment, whose increments are distributed like the logarithmic mean of the
offspring distributions. We obtain an expression of the upper rate function of
$(Z_n:n\geq0)$, that is the limit of $-\log \mathbb{P}(Z_n\geq e^{\theta n})/n$
when $n\to \infty$. It depends on the rate function of the associated random
walk of the environment, the logarithmic cost of survival
$\gamma:=-\lim_{n\to\infty} \log \mathbb{P}(Z_n>0)/n$ and the polynomial decay
$\beta$ of the tail distribution of $Z_1$. We give interpretations of this rate
function in terms of the least costly ways for the process $(Z_n: n \geq 0)$ of
attaining extraordinarily large values and describe the phase transitions. We
derive then the rate function when the reproduction law does not have heavy
tails, which generalizes the results of B\""oinghoff and Kersting (2009) and
Bansaye and Berestycki (2008) for upper large deviations. Finally, we specify
the upper large deviations for the Galton Watson processes with heavy tails.

of coefficients that have been measured for super-cooled liquid and glassy

old question by taking into account the gradual change of configurational

and pressure. Macroscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics is applied to obtain a
generalized form of the PD ratio. The classical PD ratio can then be taken as a
particular case of this generalization. Under some assumptions, a
configurational PD ratio (CPD ratio) can be expressed in terms of fictive

experimentally verify this formalism. Noteworthy and differing from previous
approaches towards the PD ratio, here, the glass transition is considered as

wormholes with the shape function $b(r)$, such that $b'(r) \approx 1$, have
very long-lived quasinormal modes in the spectrum. We have proved that the
axially symmetric traversable Lorentzian wormholes, unlike black holes and
other compact rotating objects, do not allow for superradiance. As a by product
we have shown that the 6th order WKB formula used for scattering problems of
black or wormholes provides high accuracy and thus can be used for quite
accurate calculations of the Hawking radiation processes around various black
holes.

models in order to interpret the origin of non-thermal phenomena in galaxy
clusters. We consider three neutralino DM models with light (9 GeV),
intermediate (60 GeV) and high (500 GeV) mass. The secondary particles created
by neutralino annihilation produce a multi-frequency Spectral Energy
Distribution (SED), as well as heating of the intracluster gas, that are tested
against the observations available for the Coma cluster. The DM produced SEDs
are normalized to the Coma radio halo spectrum. We find that it is not possible
to interpret all non-thermal phenomena observed in Coma in terms of DM
annihilation. The DM model with 9 GeV mass produces too small power at all
frequencies, while the DM model with 500 GeV produces a large excess power at
all frequencies. The DM model with 60 GeV and $\tau^{\pm}$ composition is
consistent with the HXR and gamma-ray data but fails to reproduce the EUV and
soft X-ray data. The DM model with 60 GeV and $b{\bar b}$ composition is always
below the observed fluxes. The radio halo spectrum of Coma is well fitted only
in the $b{\bar b}$ or light and intermediate mass DM models. The heating
produced by DM annihilation in the center of Coma is always larger than the
intracluster gas cooling rate for an NFW DM density profile and it is
substantially smaller than the cooling rate only for a cored DM density profile
in DM model with 9 GeV. We conclude that the possibility of interpreting the
origin of non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters with DM annihilation models
requires a low neutralino mass and a cored DM density profile. If we then
consider the multimessenger constraints to the neutralino annihilation
cross-section, it turns out that such scenario would also be excluded unless we
introduce a substantial boost factor due to the presence of DM substructures.

of the methods of conformal field theory, in particular the Goddard-Kent-Olive

the Dirac operator. The proof of the Weyl character formula is taken from
unpublished notes of Peter Goddard. The supersymmetric proof of the Kac
character formula for affine Kac-Moody algebras was also found independently at
roughly the same time by Greg Landweber in his Harvard Ph.D. dissertation. One
of the main novelties of this approach is a very rapid proof of the
Feigin-Fuchs character formula for the discrete series representations of the
Virasoro algebra. It relies only on the first part of the Friedan-Qiu-Shenker
unitarity theorem placing restrictions on the parameter h. Their result, which
only uses elementary properties of plane curves, is presented in detail in
these notes along with the somewhat harder result for c. A substantially
shorter treatment is possible if the final goal is just the Feigin-Fuchs
formula, since in that case only the representation theory of affine sl(2) is
needed (cf the MSRI summer course given in 2000,

works for the N=2 superconformal algebra.

spectral evolution of the flavor composition of the signal. But this
information may be lost if turbulence in the supernova `depolarizes' the
neutrinos so that the observed flux for each flavor is an equal mixture of the

the most pressing issues of this field. The most difficult aspect of studying
the effect of turbulence upon the neutrinos is the lack of any theoretical
models that allow us to understand the results of numerical studies. This paper
makes the suggestion that Random Matrix Theory (RMT) may shine some light in
this direction and presents support for this the possibility by comparing the
distribution of crossing and survival probabilities obtained numerically for
some `test case' calculations with the distributions one expects from RMT in
the calculable limit of depolarization of N neutrino flavors.

before us, we study how much this change affects the game. Our approach is
based on a \emph{rally-level analysis} of the process through which, besides
the well-known probability distribution of the scores, we also obtain the
distribution of the number of rallies. This yields a comprehensive knowledge of
the process at hand, and allows for an in-depth comparison of both scoring
systems. In particular, our results {help} to explain why the transition from
one scoring system to the other has more important implications than those
predicted from game-winning probabilities alone. Some of our findings are quite
surprising, and unattainable through Monte Carlo experiments. Our results are
of high practical relevance to international federations and local tournament

subdivision scheme is said to possess the property of reproducing exponential
polynomials if, for any initial data uniformly sampled from some exponential
polynomial function, the scheme yields the same function in the limit. The
importance of this property is due to the fact that several functions obtained
as combinations of exponential polynomials (such as conic sections, spirals or
special trigonometric and hyperbolic functions) are of great interest in
graphical and engineering applications. Since the space of exponential

extend the recently developed theory on polynomial reproduction to the

3D galaxy distribution, weigh it by the 3D galaxy density and adopt the product
projected along the line of sight with a proper weighting as an estimator of
the true kSZ temperature fluctuation $\Theta$. We thus propose to measure the
kSZ signal through the $\Hat{\Theta}$-$\Theta$ cross correlation. This approach
has a number of advantages (see details in the abstract of the paper). We test
the proposed kSZ tomography against non-adiabatic and adiabatic hydrodynamical
simulations. We confirm that $\hat{\Theta}$ is indeed tightly correlated with
$\Theta$ at $k\la 1h/$Mpc, although nonlinearities in the density and velocity
fields and nonlinear redshift distortion do weaken the tightness of the
$\hat{\Theta}$-$\Theta$ correlation. We further quantify the reconstruction
noise in $\Hat{\Theta}$ from galaxy distribution shot noise. Based on these
results, we quantify the applicability of the proposed kSZ tomography for
future surveys. We find that, in combination with the BigBOSS-N spectroscopic
redshift survey, the PLANCK CMB experiment will be able to detect the kSZ with
an overall significance of $\sim 50\sigma$ and further measure its redshift

  cluster validation","9 pages, 9 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fuzzy c-means clustering is widely used to identify cluster structures in
high-dimensional data sets, such as those obtained in DNA microarray and
quantitative proteomics experiments. One of its main limitations is the lack of
a computationally fast method to determine the two parameters fuzzifier and
cluster number. Wrong parameter values may either lead to the inclusion of
purely random fluctuations in the results or ignore potentially important data.
The optimal solution has parameter values for which the clustering does not
yield any results for a purely random data set but which detects cluster
formation with maximum resolution on the edge of randomness. Estimation of the
optimal parameter values is achieved by evaluation of the results of the
clustering procedure applied to randomized data sets. In this case, the optimal
value of the fuzzifier follows common rules that depend only on the main
properties of the data set. Taking the dimension of the set and the number of
objects as input values instead of evaluating the entire data set allows us to
propose a functional relationship determining its value directly. This result
speaks strongly against setting the fuzzifier equal to 2 as typically done in
many previous studies. Validation indices are generally used for the estimation
of the optimal number of clusters. A comparison shows that the minimum distance
between the centroids provides results that are at least equivalent or better
than those obtained by other computationally more expensive indices.

expected not to exhibit a unique state of equilibrium, depending on the
\textit{external loading} and the constitutive parameters. Beyond the standard
solution, also pore-fluid segregation, which is typically associated with
fluidization of the granular material, can arise. Pore-fluid segregation has
been recognized as a phenomenon typical of the short time behavior of a
saturated porous slab or a saturated porous sphere, during consolidation. In
both circumstances Biot's three dimensional model provides time increasing
values of the water pressure (and fluid mass density) at the center of the slab
(or of the sphere), at early times, if the Lam\'{e} constant $\mu$ of the
skeleton is different from zero. This localized pore-fluid segregation is known
in the literature as Mandel--Cryer effect. In this paper a non linear
poromechanical model is formulated. The model is able to describe the
occurrence of two states of equilibrium and the switching from one to the other
by considering a kind of \textit{phase transition}. Extending classical Biot's
theory a more than quadratic strain energy potential is postulated, depending
on the strain of the porous material and the variation of the fluid mass
density (measured with respect to the skeleton reference volume). When the
consolidating pressure is strong enough the existence of two distinct minima is
proven.

in the excitation spectrum of quantum chaotic systems. Andreev billiards are
interesting examples of such structures built with superconductors connected to
a ballistic normal metal billiard since each time an electron hits the
superconducting part it is retroreflected as a hole (and vice-versa). Using a
semiclassical framework for systems with chaotic dynamics, we show how this
reflection, along with the interference due to subtle correlations between the
classical paths of electrons and holes inside the system, are ultimately
responsible for the gap formation. The treatment can be extended to include the
effects of a symmetry breaking magnetic field in the normal part of the
billiard or an Andreev billiard connected to two phase shifted superconductors.
Therefore we are able to see how these effects can remold and eventually
suppress the gap. Furthermore the semiclassical framework is able to cover the
effect of a finite Ehrenfest time which also causes the gap to shrink. However
for intermediate values this leads to the appearance of a second hard gap - a
clear signature of the Ehrenfest time.

also examine size growth at a fixed velocity dispersion. This test, uniquely

size growth consistent with that inferred for the mass-selected sample, thus

Results: In order to test the routine we carried out a performance test by
feeding an artificially generated input spectrum into the program. Indeed the
routine performed as expected, so, as a more realistic test set-up, we tried to
create model fits for ISO spectra of selected AGB stars. Here we were not only
able to improve existing fits, but also to show that a slightly altered dust

seems to be very promising. We were able to improve existing fits and further
offer a quantitative method to compare different models with each other.

local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs). In this paper we investigate the
spatial variations of the mid-IR emission which includes: fine structure lines,
molecular hydrogen lines, polycyclic aromatic features (PAHs), continuum
emission and the 9.7um silicate feature. We also compare the nuclear and
integrated spectra. We find that the star formation takes place in extended
regions (several kpc) as probed by the PAH emission as well as the [NeII] and
[NeIII] emissions. The behavior of the integrated PAH emission and 9.7um
silicate feature is similar to that of local starburst galaxies. We also find
that the minima of the [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio tends to be located at the nuclei
and its value is lower than that of HII regions in our LIRGs and nearby
galaxies. It is likely that increased densities in the nuclei of LIRGs are
responsible for the smaller nuclear [NeIII]/[NeII] ratios. This includes the
possibility that some of the most massive stars in the nuclei are still
embedded in ultracompact HII regions. In a large fraction of our sample the
11.3um PAH emission appears more extended than the dust 5.5um continuum
emission. We find a dependency of the 11.3um PAH/7.7 um PAH and [NeII]/11.3um
PAH ratios with the age of the stellar populations. Smaller and larger ratios
respectively indicate recent star formation. The estimated warm (300 K < T <
1000 K) molecular hydrogen masses are of the order of 10^8 M_Sun, which are
similar to those found in ULIRGs, local starbursts and Seyfert galaxies.
Finally we find that the [NeII] velocity fields for most of the LIRGs in our
sample are compatible with a rotating disk at ~kpc scales, and they are in a
good agreement with H-alpha velocity fields.

realize possible mechanisms for force transduction, they can be extended by

the end of the depolymerizing MT physically prevent the Dam1 ring from falling
off the end, in the other an attractive binding secures the ring to the

competing models that seek to explain how the Dam1 ring stays on the MT. We
propose novel experimental approaches that could resolve these models for the
first time, either by changing the diffusion constant of the Dam1 ring (e.g.,
by tethering a long polymer to it) or by using a time varying load.
