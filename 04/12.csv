field and coupled to (magnetic or non-magnetic) electron reservoirs is
considered theoretically. The basic transport characteristics such as current
and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) are calculated in the weak coupling
approximation by the use of rate equation connected with Green function
formalism and slave-boson approach. The time dependent phenomenon is considered
in the gradient expansion approximation. The results show that coherent beats
pattern can be observed both in current and TMR. The proposed system consisting
of two quantum dots attached to external leads, in which the dots' levels can
be tuned independently, can be realized experimentally to test this well known
physical phenomenon. Finally, we also indicate possible practical applications
of such device.

Klein-Gordon and Dirac theories are reviewed: the solitary Dirac free particle
has, inter alia, an invariant speed well in excess of c and staggering
spontaneous Compton acceleration, but no pathologies whatsoever arise from the
square-root relativistic Hamiltonian. Dirac's key misapprehension of the
underlying four-vector character of the time-dependent,

laid bare, as is the invalidity of the standard ""proof"" that the
nonrelativistic limit of the Dirac equation is the Pauli equation. Lorentz
boosts from the particle rest frame point uniquely to the square-root
Hamiltonian, but these don't exist for a massless particle. Instead, Maxwell's
equations are dissected in spatial Fourier transform to separate nondynamical
longitudinal from dynamical transverse field degrees of freedom. Upon their
decoupling in the absence of sources, the transverse field components are seen
to obey two identical time-dependent Schroedinger equations (owing to two
linear polarizations), which have the massless free-particle diagonalized
square-root Hamiltonian. Those fields are readily modified to conform to the
attributes of solitary-photon wave functions. The wave functions' relations to
the potentials in radiation gauge are also worked out. The exercise is then
repeated without the considerable benefit of the spatial Fourier transform.

greedy algorithms: CoSaMP, Subspace Pursuit (SP), and Iterative Hard

our framework implies that, according to the best known bounds, IHT requires
the fewest number of compressed sensing measurements and has the lowest per

points generated by a mixture of $k$ probability distributions under the
assumption that the means of the distributions are well-separated, i.e., the
distance between the means of any two distributions is at least $\Omega(k)$
standard deviations. These results generally make heavy use of the generative
model and particular properties of the distributions. In this paper, we show
that a simple clustering algorithm works without assuming any generative
(probabilistic) model. Our only assumption is what we call a ""proximity
condition"": the projection of any data point onto the line joining its cluster
center to any other cluster center is $\Omega(k)$ standard deviations closer to
its own center than the other center. Here the notion of standard deviations is
based on the spectral norm of the matrix whose rows represent the difference
between a point and the mean of the cluster to which it belongs. We show that
in the generative models studied, our proximity condition is satisfied and so
we are able to derive most known results for generative models as corollaries
of our main result. We also prove some new results for generative models -
e.g., we can cluster all but a small fraction of points only assuming a bound
on the variance. Our algorithm relies on the well known $k$-means algorithm,
and along the way, we prove a result of independent interest -- that the
$k$-means algorithm converges to the ""true centers"" even in the presence of
spurious points provided the initial (estimated) centers are close enough to
the corresponding actual centers and all but a small fraction of the points
satisfy the proximity condition. Finally, we present a new technique for
boosting the ratio of inter-center separation to standard deviation.

Nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLS) with decaying potentials is studied in a
full scaling neighborhood D of the point of gradient catastrophe (x_0,t_0).
This neighborhood contains the region of modulated plane wave (with rapid phase
oscillations), as well as the region of fast amplitude oscillations (spikes).
In this paper we establish the following universal behaviors of the NLS
solutions near the point of gradient catastrophe: i) each spike has the height
3|q_0(x_0,t_0,epsilon)| and uniform shape of the rational breather solution to
the NLS, scaled to the size O(epsilon); ii) the location of the spikes are
determined by the poles of the tritronquee solution of the Painleve I (P1)
equation through an explicit diffeomorphism between D and a region into the
Painleve plane; iii) if (x,t) belongs to D but lies away from the spikes, the
asymptotics of the NLS solution q(x,t,epsilon) is given by the plane wave
approximation q_0(x,t,epsilon), with the correction term being expressed in
terms of the tritronquee solution of P1. The latter result confirms the
conjecture of Dubrovin, Grava and Klein about the form of the leading order
correction in terms of the tritronquee solution in the non-oscillatory region
around (x_0,t_0). We conjecture that the P1 hierarchy occurs at higher
degenerate catastrophe points and that the amplitudes of the spikes are odd

that the optimal procedure is heterodyne measurement followed by the
preparation of a coherent state. This procedure was known to be optimal for

in an arbitrary unknown state $\rho$ and look for the measurement-preparation
pair $(M_{n},P_{n})$ for which the reconstructed state $\omega_{n}:=P_{n}\circ
M_{n} (\rho^{\otimes n})$ is as close as possible to the input state, i.e.
$\|\omega_{n}- \rho^{\otimes n}\|_{1}$ is small. The figure of merit is based
on the trace norm distance between input and output states. We show that
asymptotically with $n$ the this problem is equivalent to the first one. The
proof and construction of $(M_{n},P_{n})$ uses the theory of local asymptotic
normality developed for state estimation which shows that i.i.d. quantum models
can be approximated in a strong sense by quantum Gaussian models. The

with regenerated photons from axions: their relative polarisations are mutually
orthogonal before Compton interacting with the surrounding plasma. Depending on
the photon-chameleon coupling and working in the strong coupling regime of the
chameleons to matter, we find that the induced photon flux, when regenerated
resonantly with the surrounding plasma, coincides with the solar flux within
the soft X-ray energy range. Moreover, using the soft X-ray solar flux as a

chameleons emitted by the sun could lead to a regenerated photon flux in the

performance. Then, axion helioscopes have thus the potential to detect and

in the form of momentum driven jets in an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)
cosmological resimulation of a galaxy cluster. The jets are powered by gas
accretion onto Super Massive Black Holes (SMBHs) which also grow by mergers.
Throughout its formation, the cluster experiences different dynamical states:
both a morphologically perturbed epoch at early times and a relaxed state at
late times allowing us to study the different modes of BH growth and associated
AGN jet feedback. BHs accrete gas efficiently at high redshift (z>2),
significantly pre-heating proto-cluster halos. Gas-rich mergers at high
redshift also fuel strong, episodic jet activity, which transports gas from the
proto-cluster core to its outer regions. At later times, while the cluster
relaxes, the supply of cold gas onto the BHs is reduced leading to lower jet
activity. Although the cluster is still heated by this activity as sound waves
propagate from the core to the virial radius, the jets inefficiently
redistribute gas outwards and a small cooling flow develops, along with
low-pressure cavities similar to those detected in X-ray observations. Overall,
our jet implementation of AGN feedback quenches star formation quite
efficiently, reducing the stellar content of the central cluster galaxy by a
factor 3 compared to the no AGN case. It also dramatically alters the shape of
the gas density profile, bringing it in close agreement with the beta model
favoured by observations, producing quite an isothermal galaxy cluster for
gigayears in the process. However, it still falls short in matching the lower
than Universal baryon fractions which seem to be commonplace in observed galaxy
clusters.

Despite decades of observations, the driving mechanism responsible for mass
loss in RSGs remains unknown. Mainly this is because the optical spectrum
accessible from the ground provides almost no useful wind diagnostics, and what
information is obtained is spatially averaged over the entire wind volume.
However, within the last decade, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of
many useful ultraviolet wind diagnostics have been obtained at a high

all. Then we argue that quantum theory should proceed not from a space-time
background but from a Lie algebra, which is treated as a symmetry algebra. With
such a formulation of symmetry, the fact that $\Lambda\neq 0$ means not that
the space-time background is curved (since the notion of the space-time
background is not physical) but that the symmetry algebra is the de Sitter
algebra rather than the Poincare one. In particular, there is no need to
involve dark energy or other fields for explaining this fact. As a consequence,
instead of the cosmological constant problem we have a problem why nowadays
Poincare symmetry is so good approximate symmetry. This is rather a problem of
cosmology but not fundamental quantum physics.

Generally, the value of linear coefficient alpha may not be smaller than one.
The following 2 settings were proved: 1) {1, 2} in the case of classical

{1, 2/(1+epsilon^2)} in the general discreet case with arbitrary rational p and

critical current. We find that with increasing microwave power $W$ and at
certain frequencies $\nu $ and $\nu $/2, the single primary peak in the

quantum tunneling of the phase across the junction}, first shifts toward lower
bias current $I$ and then a resonant peak develops. These results are explained
by quantum resonant phase escape involving single and two photons with
microwave-suppressed potential barrier. As $W$ further increases, the primary
peak gradually disappears and the resonant peak grows into a single one while
shifting further to lower $I$. At certain $W$, a second resonant peak appears,
which can locate at very low $I$ depending on the value of $\nu $. Analysis
based on the classical equation of motion shows that such resonant peak can
arise from the resonant escape of the phase particle with extremely large
oscillation amplitude resulting from bifurcation of the nonlinear system. Our
experimental result and theoretical analysis demonstrate that at $T\ll T_{cr}$,
escape of the phase particle could be dominated by classical process, such as
dynamical bifurcation of nonlinear systems under strong ac driving.

expansion approach, characterised by $O(\epsilon^m)$, where $\epsilon=1/(HL)$
is a small parameter representing the ratio of the Hubble radius to the
characteristic length scale $L$ of perturbations. We obtain the general
solution for a full nonlinear version of the curvature perturbation valid up
through second-order in $\epsilon$ ($m=2$). We find the solution satisfies a
nonlinear second-order differential equation as an extension of the equation
for the linear curvature perturbation on the comoving hypersurface. Then we
formulate a general method to match a perturbative solution accurate to
$n$-th-order in perturbation inside the horizon to our nonlinear solution
accurate to second-order ($m=2$) in the gradient expansion on scales slightly
greater than the Hubble radius. The formalism developed in this paper allows us
to calculate the superhorizon evolution of a primordial non-Gaussianity beyond
the so-called $\delta N$ formalism or separate universe approach which is
equivalent to leading order ($m=0$) in the gradient expansion. In particular,
it can deal with the case when there is a temporary violation of slow-roll
conditions. As an application of our formalism, we consider Starobinsky's
model, which is a single field model having a temporary non-slow-roll stage due
to a sharp change in the potential slope. We find that a large non-Gaussianity
can be generated even on superhorizon scales due to this temporary suspension

explicit infrared cut-off $z_{IR}$ in the deformed ${\rm AdS}_5$ warp factor.
We investigate the heavy quark potential for three cases, i.e, with only
quadratic correction, with both quadratic and logarithmic corrections and with
only logarithmic correction. We solve the dilaton field and dilation potential
from the Einstein equation, and investigate the corresponding beta function in
the G{\""u}rsoy -Kiritsis-Nitti (GKN) framework. Our studies show that in the
case with only quadratic correction, a negative $\sigma$ or the
Andreev-Zakharov model is favored to fit the heavy quark potential and to
produce the QCD beta-function at 2-loop level, however, the dilaton potential
is unbounded in infrared regime. One interesting observing for the case of
positive $\sigma$, or the soft-wall ${\rm AdS}_5$ model is that the
corresponding beta-function exists an infrared fixed point. In the case with
only logarithmic correction, the heavy quark Cornell potential can be fitted
very well, the corresponding beta-function agrees with the QCD beta-function at
2-loop level reasonably well, and the dilaton potential is bounded from below
in infrared. At the end, we propose a more compact model which has only

robust, it is important to understand their sensitivity to a variety of
parameters. In this article, we report a study of the sensitivity of a chemical
model of a cold dense core, with homogeneous and time-independent physical
conditions, to variations in the following parameters: initial chemical
inventory, gas temperature and density, cosmic-ray ionization rate, chemical
reaction rate coefficients, and elemental abundances. From the results of the
parameter variations, we can quantify the sensitivity of the model to each
parameter as a function of time. Our results can be used in principle with
observations to constrain some parameters for different cold clouds. We also
attempted to use the Monte Carlo approach with all parameters varied
collectively. Within the parameter ranges studied, the most critical parameters
turn out to be the reaction rate coefficients at times up to 4e5 yr and
elemental abundances at later times. At typical times of best agreement with
observation, models are sensitive to both of these parameters. The models are
less sensitive to other parameters such as the gas density and temperature. The
improvement of models will require that the uncertainties in rate coefficients
of important reactions be reduced. As the chemistry becomes better understood
and more robust, it should be possible to use model sensitivities concerning
other parameters, such as the elemental abundances and the cosmic ray
ionization rate, to yield detailed information on cloud properties and history.
Nevertheless, at the current stage, we cannot determine the best values of all
the parameters simultaneously based on purely observational constraints.

based on new photometric and spectroscopic observations. The two components,
which have evolved to the upper half of the main-sequence band, are quite
different with masses and radii of (1.414 +/- 0.007 Msun, 1.988 +/- 0.008 Rsun)
and (1.257 +/- 0.005 Msun, 1.474 +/- 0.017 Rsun), respectively. The 5.49 day
period orbit of BK Peg is slightly eccentric (e = 0.053). The measured
rotational velocities are 16.6 +/- 0.2 (primary) and 13.4 +/- 0.2 (secondary)
km/s. For the secondary component this corresponds to (pseudo)synchronous
rotation, whereas the primary component seems to rotate at a slightly lower
rate. We derive an iron abundance of [Fe/H] =-0.12 +/- 0.07 and similar
abundances for Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr and Ni. Yonsei-Yale and Victoria-Regina
evolutionary models for the observed metal abundance reproduce BK Peg at ages
of 2.75 and 2.50 Gyr, respectively, but tend to predict a lower age for the
more massive primary component than for the secondary. We find the same age
trend for three other upper main-sequence systems in a sample of well studied
eclipsing binaries with components in the 1.15-1.70 Msun range, where
convective core overshoot is gradually ramped up in the models. We also find
that the Yonsei-Yale models systematically predict higher ages than the
Victoria-Regina models. The sample includes BW Aqr, and as a supplement we have
determined a [Fe/H] abundance of -0.07 +/- 0.11 for this late F-type binary. We
propose to use BK Peg, BW Aqr, and other well-studied 1.15-1.70 Msun eclipsing
binaries to fine-tune convective core overshoot, diffusion, and possibly other
ingredients of modern theoretical evolutionary models.

(ii) the mass of the dark matter particle which turns to be between 1 and 2 keV

analysis of a large number of molecular emission lines excited in the
circumstellar envelope around IK~Tau. The analysis is done based on a non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer analysis, which
calculates the temperature and velocity structure in a self-consistent way. The
chemical abundance pattern is coupled to theoretical outer wind model
predictions including photodestruction and cosmic ray ionization. Not only the
integrated line intensities, but also the line shapes, are used as diagnostic
tool to study the envelope structure. Results: The deduced wind acceleration is
much slower than predicted from classical theories. SiO and SiS are depleted in
the envelope, possibly due to the adsorption onto dust grains. For HCN and CS a
clear difference with respect to inner wind non-equilibrium predictions is
found, either indicating uncertainties in the inner wind theoretical modeling
or the possibility that HCN and CS (or the radical CN) participate in the dust
formation. The low signal-to-noise profiles of SO and CN prohibit an accurate
abundance determination; the modeling of high-excitation SO$_2$ lines is
cumbersome, possibly related to line misidentifications or problems with the
collisional rates. The SiO isotopic ratios ($^{29}$SiO/$^{28}$SiO and
$^{30}$SiO/$^{28}$SiO) point toward an enhancement in $^{28}$SiO compared to
results of classical stellar evolution codes. Predictions for H$_2$O lines in

of galaxies - extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Using LISA observations, we
will be able to measure the parameters of each EMRI system detected to very
high precision. However, the statistics of the set of EMRI events observed by
LISA will be more important in constraining astrophysical models than extremely
precise measurements for individual systems. The black holes to which LISA is
most sensitive are in a mass range that is difficult to probe using other
techniques, so LISA provides an almost unique window onto these objects. In
this paper we explore, using Bayesian techniques, the constraints that LISA
EMRI observations can place on the mass function of black holes at low
redshift. We describe a general framework for approaching inference of this
type --- using multiple observations in combination to constrain a
parameterised source population. Assuming that the scaling of EMRI rate with
black hole mass is known and taking a black hole distribution given by a simple
power law, dn/d(ln M) = A (M/M_*)^b, we find that LISA could measure the
parameters to a precision of D(ln A) ~ 0.08, and D(b) ~ 0.03 for a reference
model that predicts ~1000 events. Even with as few as 10 events, LISA should
constrain the slope to a precision ~0.3, which is the current level of
observational uncertainty in the low-mass slope of the black hole mass
function. We also consider a model in which A and b evolve with redshift, but
find that EMRI observations alone do not have much power to probe such an
evolution.

SPP-wave propagation guided by the planar interface of a CSTF--infiltrated with
a fluid which supposedly contains analytes to be detected--and a metal. The
inverse Bruggeman homogenization formalism was first used to determine the
nanoscale model parameters of the CSTF. These parameters then served as inputs
to the forward Bruggeman homogenization formalism to determine the reference
relative permittivity dyadic of the infiltrated CSTF. By solving the
coresponding boundary-value problem for a modified Kretschmann configuration,
the characteristics of the multiple SPP modes at the planar interface were
investigated as functions of the refractive index of the fluid infiltrating the

bode well for the implementation of fluid-infiltrated CSTFs as SPP-based

dynamics of a charged particle on the surface of a sphere in the presence of an
externally applied magnetic field, and found a finite value for the orbital
diamagnetic moment in the long-time limit. This result is surprising in that it
seems to violate the classic Bohr-van Leeuwen Theorem on the absence of
classical diamagnetism. It was indeed questioned by some workers [EPL, 89,
(2010) 37001] who verified that the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation derived from
our Langevin equation, was satisfied by the classical canonical density in the
steady state, obtained by setting d/dt=0 in the FP equation. Inasmuch as the
canonical density does not contain the magnetic field, they concluded that the
diamagnetic moment must be zero. The purpose of this note is to show that this
argument and the conclusion are invalid -- instead of setting d/dt=0 one must
first obtain the fundamental time-dependent solution for the FP equation, and
then calculate the expectation value of the diamagnetic moment, and finally
consider its long-time limit (i.e., $t \to \infty$). This would indeed
correspond to our numerical simulation of the dynamics. That this is indeed so
is shown by considering the simpler analytically solvable problem, namely that
for an unbounded plane for which the above procedure can be carried out
exactly. We then find that the limiting value for the expectation of the
diamagnetic moment is indeed non-zero, and yet the steady-state FP equation
obtained by setting d/dt=0 is satisfied by the canonical density. Admittedly,
the exact analytical solution for the sphere is not available. But, the exact
solution obtained for the case of the unbounded 2D-plane illustrates our point
all right. We also present some further new results for other finite but
unbounded surfaces such the ellipsoids of revolution.

strength of such quantum phenomena. Here, a general convex ordering of quantum
states will be introduced which is based on the algebraic definition of
classical states. This definition resolves the ambiguity of the quantumness
quantification using topological distance measures. Classical operations on
quantum states will be considered to further generalize the ordering
prescription. Our technique can be used for a natural and unambiguous
quantification of general quantum properties whose classical reference has a
convex structure. We apply this method to typical scenarios in quantum optics
and quantum information theory to study measures which are based on the
fundamental quantum superposition principle.

continuously increasing suppression of the KHI (with complete suppression from
a contrast of 6:1 or higher). The alternative SPH formulation including an
artificial thermal conductivity reproduces the analytically expected growth
rates up to a density contrast of 10:1. The second part addresses the shear

measured the rotation periods of 93 stars for the first time, and confirmed the
periods of 41 stars already known from the literature. For further 10 stars we
revised the period determinations by other authors. The sample was augmented
with periods of 21 additional stars retrieved from the literature. In this way,

So far the experimental realization of proposed extended plasmonic networks
consisting of multiple functional elements remains challenging, mainly due to
the multi-crystallinity of commonly used thermally evaporated gold layers.
Resulting structural imperfections in individual circuit elements will
drastically reduce the yield of functional integrated nanocircuits. Here we
demonstrate the use of very large (>100 micron^2) but thin (<80 nm) chemically
grown single-crystalline gold flakes, which, after immobilization, serve as an
ideal basis for focused-ion beam milling and other top-down nanofabrication
techniques on any desired substrate. Using this methodology we obtain
high-definition ultrasmooth gold nanostructures with superior optical
properties and reproducible nano-sized features over micrometer length scales.
Our approach provides a possible solution to overcome the current fabrication
bottleneck and to realize high-definition plasmonic nanocircuitry.

1705-44, which can be considered a prototype of the class of the persistent NS
LMXBs showing both hard and soft states. The first observation was performed
when the source was in a hard low flux state, the second during a soft,
high-flux state. Both the spectra show broad iron emission lines. We fit the
spectra using a two-component model, together with a reflection model
specifically suited to the case of a neutron star, where the incident spectrum
has a blackbody shape. In the soft state, the reflection model, convolved with
a relativistic smearing component, consistently describes the broad features
present in the spectrum, and we find a clear relation between the temperature
of the incident flux and the temperature of the harder X-ray component that we
interpret as the boundary layer emission. In this state we find converging
evidence that the boundary layer outer radius is ~ 2 times the neutron star
radius. In the low flux state, we observe a change in the continuum shape of
the spectrum with respect to the soft state. Still, the broad local emission
features can be associated with a disk reflecting matter, but in a lower
ionization state, and possibly produced in an accretion disk truncated at
greater distance. Our analysis provides strong evidence that the reflection
component in soft states of LMXBs comes from to hard X-ray thermal irradiation,
which we identify with the boundary layer emission, also present in the
continuum model. In the hard state, the broad iron line if also produced by
reflection, and the continuum disk emission can be self-consistently accounted
if the disk is truncated at a greater distance than the soft state.

similarities to the generic phase diagram of the cuprates. Parent compounds
exhibit magnetic order together with a structural phase transition both of
which are progressively suppressed with doping allowing superconductivity to
emerge. The stripe-like spin arrangement of Fe moments in the magnetically
ordered state shows the identical in-plane structure for the RFeAsO (R=rare
earth) and AFe2As2 (A=Sr, Ca, Ba, Eu and K) parent compounds, notably different
than the spin configuration of the cuprates. Interestingly, Fe1+yTe orders with
a different spin order despite very similar Fermi surface topology. Studies of
the spin dynamics in the parent compounds shows that the interactions are best
characterized as anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) interactions. Despite the
room temperature tetragonal structure, analysis of the low temperature spin
waves under the assumption of a Heisenberg Hamiltonian indicates strong
in-plane anisotropy with a significant next-near neighbor interaction. In the
superconducting state, a resonance, localized in both wavevector and energy is
observed in the spin excitation spectrum as in the cuprates. This resonance is
observed at a wavevector compatible with a Fermi surface nesting instability
independent of the magnetic ordering of the relevant parent compound. The
resonance energy (Er) scales with superconducting transition temperature (TC)
as Er ~4.9 kBTC consistent with the canonical value of ~5 kBTC observed in the
cuprates. Moreover, the relationship between the resonance energy and the
superconducting gap, \Delta, is similar to that observed in many unconventional
superconductors (Er/2\Delta ~ 0.64).

temperatures were nearly equal across the sample. The Fe to Na EWR (Fe/Na)
decreases significantly with increasing surface gravity, denoting that Fe/Na is
a desirable diagnostic for deriving the surface gravity of pre-main sequence

shows that the concept of extended, structured objects emerges quite naturally

and angular momentum contain corrections to those of a point particle. We argue
that these notions also extend naturally to the quantum level. The local
description is found to be the most convenient as it manifestly displays
additional information about structure of quantum states that is more subtly
encoded in the nonlocal, unconstrained description. Subsequently we use this

fluctuations are used to characterize an on-demand electron source consisting
of a quantum dot connected to a conductor via a tunable tunnel barrier. We
observe a new fundamental noise for electrons associated with the quantum
fluctuations of the electron emission time, which we call quantum jitter. In
optimum operating conditions of the source, the noise reduces to the quantum
jitter limit, which demonstrates single particle emission. Combined with the
coherent manipulations of single electrons in a quantum conductor, this
electron quantum optics experiment opens the way to explore new problems
including quantum statistics and interactions at the single electron level.

access it using only the tensor-by-vector-by-vector multiplication subroutine.
In the matrix case, Krylov methods are methods of choice to approximate the
dominant column and row subspaces of a sparse or structured matrix given
through the matrix-by-vector multiplication subroutine. Using the Wedderburn
rank reduction formula, we propose an algorithm of matrix approximation that
computes Krylov subspaces and allows generalization to the tensor case. Several
variants of proposed tensor algorithms differ by pivoting strategies, overall
cost and quality of approximation. By convincing numerical experiments we show
that the proposed methods are faster and more accurate than the minimal Krylov
recursion, proposed recently by Elden and Savas.

from photometric and spectroscopic analysis, it is essential to independently
measure the stellar mass. This is often achieved by the use of evolutionary
tracks and isochrones, but the mass result is only as reliable as the models
used. The recent paper by Torres et al (2009) showed that accurate values for
stellar masses and radii could be obtained from a calibration using T_eff, log
g and [Fe/H]. We investigate whether a similarly good calibration can be
obtained by substituting log rho - the fundamental parameter measured for the
host star of a transiting planet - for log g, and apply this to star-exoplanet
systems. We perform a polynomial fit to stellar binary data provided in Torres
et al (2009) to obtain the stellar mass and radius as functions of T_eff, log
rho and [Fe/H], with uncertainties on the fit produced from a Monte Carlo
analysis. We apply the resulting equations to measurements for seventeen
SuperWASP host stars, and also demonstrate the application of the calibration
in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to obtain accurate system parameters
where spectroscopic estimates of effective stellar temperature and metallicity
are available. We show that the calibration using log rho produces accurate
values for the stellar masses and radii; we obtain masses and radii of the
SuperWASP stars in good agreement with isochrone analysis results. We ascertain
that the mass calibration is robust against uncertainties resulting from poor
photometry, although a good estimate of stellar radius requires good-quality
transit light curve to determine the duration of ingress and egress.

two-band, semiconductor-related solid which is driven by a ultrashort,
classical laser field. We describe the generation of exciton quasi-particles
from the driving laser field as anomalous pairings of the fundamental,
fermionic fields. This gives rise to Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations from
the quartic, fermionic interaction to various Gaussian terms of self-energy
matrices. We accomplish path integrals of even-valued self-energy matrices with
Euclidean integration measure where three cases of increasing complexity are
classified (scalar self-energy variable, density-related self-energy matrix and
also a self-energy including anomalous-doubled terms). According to the
driving, anomalous-doubled Hamiltonian part, we also specify the case of a SSB
with 'hinge' fields which factorizes the total self-energy matrix by a coset
decomposition into density-related, block diagonal self-energy matrices of a
background functional and into coset matrices with off-diagonal block
generators for the anomalous pairings of fermions. In particular we investigate
the transformation from the coset fields of a curved coset space, as the
independent field degrees of freedom, to locally 'flat' fields with Euclidean
integration measure. This allows to reduce the final path integral to solely
'Nambu'-doubled fields after a saddle point approximaton for the
density-related self-energy matrices and also allows to derive classical field
equations for exciton quasi-particles from various kinds of gradient expansions
of the determinant.

stochastic large scale kinematic dynamo during reheating. We consider a charged
scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. During inflation this field is
assumed to be in its vacuum state. At the transition to reheating the state of
the field changes to a many particle/anti-particle state. We characterize that
state as a fluid flow of zero mean velocity but with a stochastic velocity
field. We compute the scale-dependent Reynolds number $% Re(k)$, and the
characteristic times for decay of turbulence, $t_{d}$ and pair annihilation
$t_{a}$, finding $t_{a}<< t_{d}$. We calculate the rms value of the kinetic
helicity of the flow over a scale $\mathcal{L}$ and show that it does not
vanish. We use this result to estimate the amplification factor of a seed field
from the stochastic kinematic dynamo equations. Although this effect is weak,
it shows that the evolution of the cosmic magnetic field from reheating to
galaxy formation may well be more complex than as dictated by simple flux
freezing.

concepts and methods: broad cycle, main segment, useful cut and insert,

Hamilton cycle problem. Thus we proved that NP=P. The key points of this paper
are: 1) there are two ways to get a Hamilton cycle in exponential time: a full
permutation of n vertices; or, chose n edges from all k edges, and check all
possible combinations. The main problem is: how to avoid checking all
combinations of n edges from all edges. My algorithm can avoid this. Lemma 1
and lemma 2 are very important. They are the foundation that we always can get
a good branch in the depth-first search tree and can get a series of destroying
edges (all are bad edges) for this good branch in polynomial time. The
extraordinary insights are: destroying edges, a tree contains each main segment
at most one time at the same time, and dynamic combinations. The difficult part
is to understand how to construct a main segment's series of destroying edges
by dynamic combinations. The proof logic is: if there is at least on Hamilton
cycle in the graph, we always can do useful cut and inserts until a Hamilton
cycle is got. The times of useful cut and inserts are polynomial. So if at any
step we cannot have a useful cut and insert, this means that there are no
Hamilton cycles in the graph. In this version, I add a detailed polynomial time
