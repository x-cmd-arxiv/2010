network of a population are static. The dynamics of relationships is only taken
indirectly into account, by assuming that the relevant information to study
epidemic spread is encoded in the network obtained by considering numbers of
partners accumulated over periods of time roughly proportional to the
infectious period of the disease at hand. On the other hand, models explicitly
including social dynamics are often too schematic to provide a reasonable
representation of a real population, or so detailed that no general conclusions
can be drawn from them. Here we present a model of social dynamics that is
general enough that its parameters can be obtained by fitting data from surveys
about sexual behaviour, but that can still be studied analytically, using mean
field techniques. This allows us to obtain some general results about epidemic
spreading. We show that using accumulated network data to estimate the static
epidemic threshold leads to a significant underestimation of it. We also show
that, for a dynamic network, the relative epidemic threshold is an increasing
function of the infectious period of the disease, implying that the static
value is a lower bound to the real threshold.

by real-world applications and in part by its connection to Network Coding. The
basic setting of Index Coding encodes the problem input as an undirected graph
and the fundamental parameter is the broadcast rate $\beta$, the average
communication cost per bit for sufficiently long messages (i.e. the non-linear
vector capacity). Recent nontrivial bounds on $\beta$ were derived from the
study of other Index Coding capacities (e.g. the scalar capacity $\beta_1$) by
Bar-Yossef et al (2006), Lubetzky and Stav (2007) and Alon et al (2008).
However, these indirect bounds shed little light on the behavior of $\beta$:
there was no known polynomial-time algorithm for approximating $\beta$ in a
general network to within a nontrivial (i.e. $o(n)$) factor, and the exact
value of $\beta$ remained unknown for any graph where Index Coding is
nontrivial.
  Our main contribution is a direct information-theoretic analysis of the
broadcast rate $\beta$ using linear programs, in contrast to previous
approaches that compared $\beta$ with graph-theoretic parameters. This allows
us to resolve the aforementioned two open questions. We provide a
polynomial-time algorithm with a nontrivial approximation ratio for computing
$\beta$ in a general network along with a polynomial-time decision procedure
for recognizing instances with $\beta=2$. In addition, we pinpoint $\beta$
precisely for various classes of graphs (e.g. for various Cayley graphs of
cyclic groups) thereby simultaneously improving the previously known upper and
lower bounds for these graphs. Via this approach we construct graphs where the
difference between $\beta$ and its trivial lower bound is linear in the number
of vertices and ones where $\beta$ is uniformly bounded while its upper bound
derived from the naive encoding scheme is polynomially worse.

disprove this conjecture. By relating the question of finding LMI

in a significant way on fluid viscosity $\nu$ and resistivity $\eta$ through
the magnetic Prandtl number $Pm=\nu/\eta$. In particular, the transport
decreases with decreasing $Pm$; if persistent at very large Reynolds numbers,
this trend may lead to question the role of MRI-turbulence in YSO disks, whose
Prandtl number is usually very small. In this context, the principle objective
of the present investigation is to characterize in a refined way the role of
dissipation. Another objective is to characterize the effect of linear (channel
modes) and quasi-linear (parasitic modes) physics in the behavior of the
transport. These objectives are addressed with the help of a number of
incompressible numerical simulations. The horizontal extent of the box size has
been increased in order to capture all relevant (fastest growing) linear and
secondary parasitic unstable modes. The major results are the following: i- The
increased accuracy in the computation of transport averages shows that the
dependence of transport on physical dissipation exhibits two different regimes:
for $Pm \lesssim 1$, the transport has a power-law dependence on the magnetic
Reynolds number rather than on the Prandtl number; for $Pm > 1$, the data are
consistent with a primary dependence on $Pm$ for large enough ($\sim 10^3$)
Reynolds numbers. ii- The transport-dissipation correlation is not clearly or
simply related to variations of the linear modes growth rates. iii- The
existence of the transport-dissipation correlation depends neither on the
number of linear modes captured in the simulations, nor on the effect of the
parasitic modes on the saturation of the linear modes growth. iv- The transport
is usually not dominated by axisymmetric (channel) modes

source of information about the upper atmospheres of extrasolar planets. So
far, UV transit observations have led to the detection of atomic hydrogen,
oxygen and ionized carbon in the upper atmosphere of HD209458b. The
interpretation of these observations is controversial - it is not clear if the
absorption arises from an escaping atmosphere interacting with the stellar
radiation and stellar wind, or the thermosphere inside the Roche lobe. Here we
introduce an empirical model that can be used to analyze UV transit depths of
extrasolar planets and use it to interpret the transits of HD209458b in the H
Ly alpha and the OI triplet emission lines. The results indicate that the mean
temperature of the thermosphere is 8,000-11,000 K and that the H2/H
dissociation front is located at pressures between 0.1-1 microbar, which
correspond to an altitude of 1.1 Rp. The upper boundary of the model
thermosphere is located at altitudes between 2.7-3 Rp, above which the
atmosphere is mostly ionized. We find that the HI transit depth reflects the
optical depth of the thermosphere in the wings of the H Ly alpha line but that
the atmosphere also overflows the Roche lobe. By assuming a solar mixing ratio
of oxygen, we obtain an OI transit depth that is statistically consistent with
the observations. An OI transit depth comparable to or slightly larger than the
HI transit depth is possible if the atmosphere is undergoing fast hydrodynamic
escape, the O/H ratio is supersolar, or if a significant quantity of neutral
oxygen is found outside the Roche lobe. Due to the large uncertainty in the
data, repeated observations are necessary to better constrain the OI transit
depths and thus the composition of the thermosphere.

spicules emanate. The model parameters are broadly compatible with earlier
studies of spicules. The visibility of Ca II spicules down to the limb in
Hinode data seems to require that spicule emission be Doppler shifted relative
to the stratified atmosphere, either by supersonic turbulent or organized
spicular motion. The non-spicule component of the chromosphere is almost
invisible in the broad band BFI data, but we predict that it will be clearly

semi-major axis, in the nonlinear regime. This procedure is achieved from
simulated data in the presence of realistic noise perturbations, to control the
reconstruction error. By way of illustration we have applied our procedure to
the Mimas 5:3 density wave. We were able to recover precisely the kinematic
parameters from the radio experiment occultation data in most of the
propagation region; a preliminary analysis of the pressure-corrected dispersion
allowed us to determine new but still uncertain values for the opacity
($K\simeq 0.02$ cm$^2$/g) and velocity dispersion of ($c_o\simeq 0.6$ cm/s) in
the wave region. Our procedure constitutes the first step in our planned
analysis of the density waves of Saturn's rings. It is very accurate and
efficient in the far-wave region. However, improvements are required within the
first wavelength. The ways in which this method can be used to establish
diagnostics of ring physics are outlined.

to match the perturbation variables before and after the phase transition which
generates the magnetic field, in such a way that the total energy momentum

satisfied. We further solve the evolution equations for the metric and fluid

next-to-leading order in the large scale limit. The leading order term is in
fact strongly suppressed due to the presence of free-streaming neutrinos. We
derive the neutrino compensation effect dynamically and confirm that the

extend such correlations toward lower fluence/peak energy values with respect
to BATSE ones whereas no GBM long burst with E_peak_obs exceeding a few MeV is
found, despite the possibility of detecting them. Again as for BATSE, $\sim$ 5%
of long and almost all short GRBs detected by Fermi/GBM are outliers of the
E_peak-isotropic equivalent energy (""Amati"") correlation while no outlier
(neither long nor short) of the E_peak-isotropic equivalent luminosity
(""Yonetoku"") correlation is found. Fermi long bursts have similar typical
values of E_peak_obs but a harder low energy spectral index with respect to all
BATSE events, exacerbating the inconsistency with the limiting slopes of the
simplest synchrotron emission models. Although the short GRBs detected by Fermi
are still only a few, we confirm that their E_peak_obs is greater and the low
energy spectrum is harder than those of long ones. We discuss the robustness of
these results with respect to observational biases induced by the differences
between the GBM and BATSE instruments.

has a spectroscopic redshift z=1.91 and has been identified as an extremely
compact galaxy by Daddi et al. 2005. We use new H-F160W imaging data obtained
with Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 to measure the deconvolved surface brightness
profile to H = 28 mag arcsec**-2. We find that the surface brightness profile
is well approximated by an n=3.7 Sersic profile. Our deconvolved profile is
constructed by a new technique which corrects the best-fit Sersic profile with
the residual of the fit to the observed image. This allows for galaxy profiles
which deviate from a Sersic profile. We determine the effective radius of this
galaxy: r_e=0.42 +- 0.14 kpc in the observed H-F160W-band. We show that this
result is robust to deviations from the Sersic model used in the fit. We test
the sensitivity of our analysis to faint ""wings"" in the profile using simulated
galaxy images consisting of a bright compact component and a faint extended
component. We find that due to the combination of the WFC3 imaging depth and
our method's sensitivity to extended faint emission we can accurately trace the
intrinsic surface brightness profile, and that we can therefore confidently
rule out the existence of a faint extended envelope around the observed galaxy
down to our surface brightness limit. These results confirm that the galaxy
lies a factor of 10 off from the local mass-size relation.

Class II counterparts are aligned in an arc ~3 pc long suggestive of a
triggered formation process induced by the O stars in NGC 2244. The diskless
Class III sources are more dispersed. Several X-ray emitting stars are located
inside the molecular cloud and around gaseous pillars projecting from the
cloud. These stars, together with a previously unreported optical outflow
originating inside the cloud, indicate that star formation is continuing at a
low level and the cluster is still growing. This X-ray view of young stars on
the western side of the Rosette Nebula complements our earlier studies of the
central cluster NGC 2244 and the embedded clusters on the eastern side of the

consistent with a scenario in which the rich central NGC 2244 cluster formed
first, and its expanding HII region triggered the formation of the
now-unobscured clusters RMC XA and NGC 2237. A large swept-up shell material
around the HII region is now in a second phase of collect-and-collapse
fragmentation, leading to the recent formation of subclusters. Other clusters
deeper in the molecular cloud appear unaffected by the Nebula expansion.

that the probability that the Byzantine attack goes undetected decreases
exponentially fast with respect to the number of channel uses, while the loss
in the secrecy rate, compared to the rate achievable when the relay is honest,

distinguish chaotic from stochastic fluctuations in short experimental
recordings. This dilemma underlies many complex systems models from stochastic
gene expression or stock exchange to quantum chaos. Traditionally,
deterministic chaos is characterized by ""sensitive dependence on initial
conditions"" as indicated by a positive Lyapunov exponent. However, ambiguity
arises when applying this criterion to real-world data that are corrupted by
measurement noise or perturbed nonautonomously by exogenous deterministic or
stochastic inputs. Here, we show that a positive Lyapunov exponent is
surprisingly neither necessary nor sufficient proof of deterministic chaos, and
that a nonlinear dynamical system under deterministic or stochastic forcing may
exhibit multiple forms of nonautonomous chaos assessable by a noise titration
assay. These findings lay the foundation for reliable analysis of
low-dimensional chaos for complex systems modeling and prediction of a wide
variety of physical, biological, and socioeconomic data.

coupled FENE-type bead-spring chain models that arise from the kinetic theory
of dilute solutions of polymeric liquids with noninteracting polymer chains.
The class of models involves the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations in a bounded domain in two or three space dimensions for the velocity
and the pressure of the fluid, with an elastic extra-stress tensor appearing on
the right-hand side in the momentum equation. The extra-stress tensor stems
from the random movement of the polymer chains and is defined by the Kramers
expression through the associated probability density function that satisfies a
Fokker-Planck-type parabolic equation, a crucial feature of which is the
presence of a center-of-mass diffusion term. We require no structural
assumptions on the drag term in the Fokker-Planck equation; in particular, the
drag term need not be corotational. With a square-integrable and
divergence-free initial velocity datum for the Navier-Stokes equation and a
nonnegative initial probability density function for the Fokker-Planck
equation, which has finite relative entropy with respect to the Maxwellian of
the model, we prove the existence of a global-in-time weak solution to the
coupled Navier-Stokes-Fokker-Planck system. It is also shown that in the
absence of a body force, the weak solution decays exponentially in time to the
equilibrium solution, at a rate that is independent of the choice of the
initial datum and of the centre-of-mass diffusion coefficient.

[3.6]-[4.5] >= 1.5 and [4.5] - [8.0] <= 2.0 on the Vega system. The first color

brown dwarfs with spectral classes later than T7, while the second eliminates
14 probable reddened AGN. Optical detection of 4 of the remaining 18 sources
implies they are likely also AGN, leaving 14 brown dwarf candidates. For two of
the brightest candidates (SDWFS J143524.44+335334.6 and SDWFS
J143222.82+323746.5), the spectral energy distributions including near-infrared
detections suggest a spectral class of ~ T8. The proper motion is < 0.25 ""/yr,
consistent with expectations for a luminosity inferred distance of >70 pc. The
reddest brown dwarf candidate (SDWFS J143356.62+351849.2) has [3.6] -
[4.5]=2.24 and H - [4.5] > 5.7, redder than any published brown dwarf in these

Models from Burrows et al. (2003) predict larger numbers of cool brown dwarfs
should be found for a Chabrier (2003) mass function. Suppressing the model
[4.5] flux by a factor of two, as indicated by previous work, brings the
Burrows models and observations into reasonable agreement. The recently

decoupled solutions: F_s(x,Q^2)={\cal F}_s(F_{s0}(x), G_0(x)), G(x,Q^2)={\cal

$F_{s0}(x) \equiv F_s(x,Q_0^2)$ and $G_{0}(x) \equiv G(x,Q_0^2)$, the chosen
starting functions at the virtuality $Q_0^2$. As a proof of method, we compare
our numerical results from the above equations with the published MSTW LO gluon
and singlet $F_s$ distributions, starting from their initial values at $Q_0^2=1
GeV^2$. Our method completely decouples the two LO distributions, at the same
time guaranteeing that both distributions satisfy the singlet coupled DGLAP
equations. It furnishes us with a new tool for readily obtaining the effects of
the starting functions (independently) on the gluon and singlet structure
functions, as functions of both $Q^2$ and $Q_0^2$. In addition, it can also be
used for non-singlet distributions, thus allowing one to solve analytically for
individual quark and gluon distributions values at a given $x$ and $Q^2$, with
typical numerical accuracies of about 1 part in $10^5$, rather than having to
evolve numerically coupled integral-differential equations on a two-dimensional

calibrated and demonstrated to recover the aromatic fraction of the IRAC 8
micron flux with a standard deviation of 6% for a training set of 40 SINGS
galaxies (ranging from stellar to dust dominated) with both suitable
mid-infrared Spitzer IRS spectra and equivalent photometry. A potential factor
of two improvement could be realized with suitable 5.5 and 10 micron
photometry, such as what may be provided in the future by JWST. The resulting
technique is then applied to mid-infrared photometry for the 258 galaxies from
the Local Volume Legacy (LVL) survey, a large sample dominated in number by
low-luminosity dwarf galaxies for which obtaining comparable mid-infrared
spectroscopy is not feasible. We find the total LVL luminosity due to five
strong aromatic features in the 8 micron complex to be 2.47E10 solar
luminosities with a mean volume density of 8.8E6 solar luminosities per cubic
Megaparsec. Twenty-four of the LVL galaxies, corresponding to a luminosity cut
at M = -18.22 in the B band, account for 90% of the aromatic luminosity. Using
oxygen abundances compiled from the literature for 129 of the 258 LVL galaxies,
we find a correlation between metallicity and the aromatic to total infrared
emission ratio but not the aromatic to total 8 micron dust emission ratio. A
possible explanation is that metallicity plays a role in the abundance of
aromatic molecules relative to the total dust content, but other factors such
as star formation and/or the local radiation field affect the excitation of
those molecules.

number using FLASH a widely used Eulerian grid-based code and PHANTOM, a
Lagrangian SPH code at resolutions of up to 512^3 in both grid cells and SPH

properties: a slope of k^-1.95 in the velocity power spectrum for hydrodynamic,
Mach 10 turbulence, evidence in both codes for a Kolmogorov-like slope of
k^-5/3 in the variable rho^1/3 v as suggested by Kritsuk et al. and a
log-normal PDF with a width that scales with Mach number and proportionality
constant b=0.33-0.5 in the density variance-Mach number relation. The measured
structure function slopes are not converged in either code at 512^3 elements.
We find that, for measuring volumetric statistics such as the power spectrum
slope and structure function scaling, SPH and grid codes give roughly
comparable results when the number of SPH particles is approximately equal to
the number of grid cells. In particular, to accurately measure the power
spectrum slope in the inertial range, in the absence of subgrid models,
requires at least 512^3 computational elements in either code. On the other
hand the SPH code was found to be better at resolving dense structures, giving
max. densities at a resolution of 128^3 particles that were similar those
resolved in the grid code at 512^3 cells, reflected also in the high density
tail of the PDF. We find SPH to be more dissipative at comparable numbers of
computational elements in statistics of the velocity field, but correspondingly
less dissipative than the grid code in the statistics of density weighted
quantities such as rho^1/3 v. For SPH simulations of high Mach number
turbulence we find it important to use sufficient non-linear beta-viscosity to
prevent particle interpenetration in shocks (we require beta=4 instead of the

films on $\rm (LaAlO_3)_{0.3}(Sr_2AlTaO_6)_{0.7}$ substrate are investigated as
functions of temperature, magnetic field and spin polarization by means of
scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Systematic surveys of the tunneling spectra
taken with Pt/Ir tips reveal spatial variations on the length scale of a few
hundred nanometers in the ferromagnetic state, which may be attributed to the
intrinsic heterogeneity of the manganites due to their tendency towards phase
separation. The electronic heterogeneity is found to decrease either with
increasing field at low temperatures or at temperatures above all magnetic
ordering temperatures. On the other hand, spectra taken with Cr-coated tips are
consistent with convoluted electronic properties of both LCMO and Cr. In
particular, for temperatures below the magnetic ordering temperatures of both
Cr and LCMO, the magnetic-field dependent tunneling spectra may be
quantitatively explained by the scenario of spin-polarized tunneling in a
spin-valve configuration. Moreover, a low-energy insulating energy gap $\sim
0.6$ eV commonly found in the tunneling conductance spectra of bulk metallic
LCMO at $T \to 0$ may be attributed to a surface ferromagnetic insulating (FI)
phase, as evidenced by its spin filtering effect at low temperatures and
vanishing gap value above the Curie temperature. Additionally, temperature
independent pseudogap (PG) phenomena existing primarily along the boundaries of
magnetic domains are observed in the zero-field tunneling spectra. The PG
becomes strongly suppressed by applied magnetic fields at low temperatures when
the tunneling spectra of LCMO become highly homogeneous. These findings suggest
that the occurrence PG is associated with the electronic heterogeneity of the
manganites.

that the Bootstrap AMG eigensolver by itself can efficiently compute accurate

eigenmodes. This in turn allows for the use of the resulting AMG hierarchy to
accelerate the MLE steps using standard multigrid correction steps. The

non-symmetric stochastic M-matrices, showing promising results for all problems

itself define any preferred notion of time. We first extract as much

the Clebsch decomposition theorem to the Kodama vector. We thus construct a
geometrically preferred coordinate system for any time-dependent spherically

preferred fiducial observers, and demonstrate that it is possible to define and
calculate a generalized notion of surface gravity that is valid throughout the

More precisely, we consider the partial wave scattering matrices $S(\lambda,n)$

momentum) defined as the restrictions of the full scattering matrix on a well
chosen basis of spin-weighted spherical harmonics. We prove that the mass $M$,
the square of the charge $Q^2$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ of a

knowledge of either the transmission coefficients $T(\lambda, n)$, or the
reflexion coefficients $R(\lambda, n)$ (resp. $L(\lambda, n)$), for all $n \in
{\mathcal{L}}$ where $\mathcal{L}$ is a subset of $\N^*$ that satisfies the
M\""untz condition $\sum_{n \in {\mathcal{L}}} \frac{1}{n} = +\infty$. Our main
tool consists in complexifying the angular momentum $n$ and in studying the
analytic properties of the ""unphysical"" scattering matrix $S(\lambda,z)$ in the
complex variable $z$. We show in particular that the quantities
$\frac{1}{T(\lambda,z)}$, $\frac{R(\lambda,z)}{T(\lambda,z)}$ and
$\frac{L(\lambda,z)}{T(\lambda,z)}$ belong to the Nevanlinna class in the
region $\{z \in \C, \ Re(z) >0 \}$ for which we have analytic uniqueness

and then propose a novel alternative-explanation. The new alternative
explanation is based on refraction-phenomenon of optics. Estimation of results
with new approach are in agreement with known values. Though physics is
different, but it is argued that general-relativity based gravitational-bending
and refraction based bending have more in common than is generally realized.
Also discussed are black-hole and gravitational-lensing in the new perspective
of refraction. The new refraction-based theory makes a few new predictions and
also suggests a few tests.

dynamics in the orientational relaxation of molecules in confined systems such
as water in reverse micelles, cyclodextrin cavities and nano-tubes. Here we
introduce a novel finite length one dimensional Ising model to investigate the
propagation and the annihilation of dynamical correlations in finite systems
and to understand the intriguing shortening of the orientational relaxation
time that has been reported for small sized reverse micelles. In our finite
sized model, the two spins at the two end cells are oriented in the opposite
directions, to mimic the effects of surface that in real system fixes water
orientation in the opposite directions. This produces opposite polarizations to
propagate inside from the surface and to produce bulk-like condition at the
centre. This model can be solved analytically for short chains. For long chains
we solve the model numerically with Glauber spin flip dynamics (and also with
Metropolis single-spin flip Monte Carlo algorithm). We show that model nicely
reproduces many of the features observed in experiments. Due to the destructive
interference among correlations that propagate from the surface to the core,
one of the rotational relaxation time components decays faster than the bulk.
In general, the relaxation of spins is non-exponential due to the interplay
between various interactions. In the limit of strong coupling between the spins
or in the limit of low temperature, the nature of relaxation of the spins
undergoes a qualitative change with the emergence of a homogeneous dynamics
where decay is predominantly exponential, again in agreement with experiments.

accepted as the primary cause of the growth instability in the form of
quasi-regular mound-like structures observed on the surface of thin film grown

mound formation was proposed in terms of a topologically induced flux of
particles originating from the line tension of the step edges which form the
contour lines around a mound. Through large-scale simulations of MBE growth on
a variety of crystalline lattice planes using limited mobility, solid-on-solid
models introduced by Wolf-Villain and Das Sarma-Tamborenea in 2+1 dimensions,
we propose yet another type of topological uphill particle current which is
unique to some lattice, and has hitherto been overlooked in the literature.
Without ES barrier, our simulations produce spectacular mounds very similar, in
some cases, to what have been observed in many recent MBE experiments. On a
lattice where these currents cease to exist, the surface appears to be
scale-invariant, statistically rough as predicted by the conventional continuum
growth equation.

not been realized, Voevodsky has constructed a triangulated category of
geometric motives over a perfect field, which has many of the properties
expected of the derived category of the conjectural abelian category of
motives. The construction of the triangulated category of motives has been
extended by Cisinski-D\'{e}glise to a triangulated category of motives over a
base-scheme $S$. Recently, Bondarko constructed a DG category of motives, whose
homotopy category is equivalent to Voevodsky's category of effective geometric
motives, assuming resolution of singularities. Soon after, Levine extended this
idea to construct a DG category whose homotopy category is equivalent to the
full subcategory of motives over a base-scheme $S$ generated by the motives of
smooth projective $S$-schemes, assuming that $S$ is itself smooth over a
perfect field. In both constructions, the tensor structure requires
$\mathbb{Q}$-coefficients. In my thesis, I show how to provide a tensor
structure on the homotopy category mentioned above, when $S$ is semi-local and
essentially smooth over a field of characteristic zero. This is done by
defining a pseudo-tensor structure on the DG category of motives constructed by
Levine, which induces a tensor structure on its homotopy category.

colloidal glasses which display physical aging. This phenomenon is still not
completely understood and in particular, little is known about the connection
between the flow history, as a determinant of the initial state of the system,
and the subsequent aging dynamics. Using a stress controlled rheometer, we
perform stress jump experiments to observe the elastic component of the flow
stress that remains on cessation of flow or flow quenching. We investigate the
connection between the dynamics of these residual stresses and the rate of
physical aging upon quenching from different points on the steady state flow
curve. Quenching from high rates produces a fluid state, G"">G', with small,
fast relaxing residual stresses and rapid, sigmoidal aging of the complex
modulus. Conversely, quenching from lower shear rates produces increasingly
jammed states featuring slowly relaxing stresses and a slow increase of the
complex modulus with system age. Flow cessation from a fixed shear rate with
varying quench durations shows that slower quenches produce smaller residual
stresses at short times which relax at long times by smaller extents, by
comparison with faster quenches. These smaller stresses are correlated with a
higher modulus but slower physical aging of the system. The characteristic time
for the residual stress relaxation scales inversely with the quench rate. This
implies a frustrated approach to any ideal stress-free state that succinctly
reflects the frustrated nature of these glassy systems.

theory of multiple M2-branes is the choice of the Lie 3-algebra. The Lie
3-algebra should be chosen such that the corresponding BLG model is unitary and
admits fuzzy 3-sphere as a solution. In this paper we propose another new
condition: the Lie 3-algebras of use must be connected to the semisimple Lie
algebras describing the gauge symmetry of D-branes via a certain reduction
condition. We show that this reduction condition leads to a natural
generalization of the Cartan-Weyl 3-algebras introduced in arXiv:1004.1397.
Similar to a Cartan-Weyl 3-algebra, a generalized Cartan-Weyl 3-algebra
processes a set of step generators characterized by non-degenerate roots.
However, its Cartan subalgebra is non-abelian in general. We give reasons why
having a non-abelian Cartan subalgebra may be just right to allow for fuzzy
3-sphere solution in the corresponding BLG models. We propose that generalized
Cartan-Weyl 3-algebras is the right class of metric Lie 3-algebras to be used
in the BLG theory.

6446-326-1. The star, WASP-22, is a moderately bright (V=12.0) solar-type star
(Teff = 6000 +/- 100 K, [Fe/H] = -0.05 +/- 0.08). The lightcurve of the star
obtained with the WASP-South instrument shows periodic transit-like features
with a depth of about 1 and a duration of 0.14 days. The presence of a
transit-like feature in the lightcurve is confirmed using z-band photometry
obtained with Faulkes Telescope South. High resolution spectroscopy obtained
with the CORALIE and HARPS spectrographs confirm the presence of a planetary
mass companion with an orbital period of 3.533 days in a near-circular orbit.
From a combined analysis of the spectroscopic and photometric data assuming
that the star is a typical main-sequence star we estimate that the planet has a
mass M_p = 0.56 +/- 0.02 M_Jup and a radius R_p = 1.12 +/- 0.04 R_Jup. In
addition, there is a linear trend of 40 m/s/yr in the radial velocities
measured over 16 months, from which we infer the presence of a third body with
a long period orbit in this system. The companion may be a low mass M-dwarf, a
white dwarf or a second planet.

to have a significant impact on the stochastic properties of return trials such
as the return distribution, volatility clustering, and the multifractal
behavior of time scales of asset returns. Particularly we observe a cross over
in the return distribution from a Gaussian-like to a Levy-like shape when the
degree of decoupling increases. In parallel, the larger the degree of

analyzed by applying an iterative scheme, devised to disentangle the effect of
eclipses from the oscillatory pattern. In addition to the CoRoT photometry we
obtained low resolution spectroscopy with the AAOmega multi-fiber facility at
the Anglo Australian Observatory, which yielded a spectral classification as F0
V and allowed us to infer a value of the primary star effective temperature.
The Fourier analysis of the residuals, after subtraction of the binary light
curve, gave 35 clear frequencies. The highest amplitude frequency, of 1.22 c/d,
is in the expected range for both \gamma Dor and SPB pulsators, but the
spectral classification favors the first hypothesis. Apart from a few multiples
of the orbital period, most frequencies can be interpreted as rotational
splitting of the main frequency (an l = 2 mode) and of its overtones.

emission fluctuations from NGC 4254 to investigate whether it carries any
imprint of galaxy harassment. The power spectrum, as determined using the 16
central channels which contain most of the HI emission, is found to be well
fitted by a power law $P(U)=AU^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha\ =-\ 1.7\pm 0.2$ at
length-scales $1.7 \, {\rm k pc}$ to $ 8.4 \, {\rm kpc}$. This is similar to
other normal spiral galaxies which have a slope of $\sim -1.5$ and is
interpreted as arising from two dimensional turbulence at length-scales larger
than the galaxy's scale-height. NGC 4254 is hence yet another example of a
spiral galaxy that exhibits scale-invariant density fluctuations out to
length-scales comparable to the diameter of the HI disk. While a large variety
of possible energy sources like proto-stellar winds, supernovae, shocks, etc.
have been proposed to produce turbulence, it is still to be seen whether these
are effective on length-scales comparable to that of the entire HI disk. On
separately analyzing the HI power spectrum in different parts of NGC 4254, we
find that the outer parts have a different slope ($ \alpha = -2.0\pm0.3$)
compared to the central part of the galaxy ($\alpha = -1.5\pm0.2$). Such a
change in slope is not seen in other, undisturbed galaxies. We suggest that, in
addition to changing the overall morphology, galaxy harassment also effects the
fine scale structure of the ISM, causing the power spectrum to have a steeper
slope in the outer parts.

Ratios (I.P.R.) $Y_q(L)$ display the following fluctuations between the
disordered samples of linear size $L$ : with respect to the typical value
$Y^{typ}_q(L) = e^{\bar{\ln Y_q(L)}} \sim L^{- \tau_{typ}(q)} $ that involve
the typical multifractal spectrum $\tau_{typ}(q)$, the rescaled variable
$y=Y_q(L)/Y^{typ}_q(L) $ is distributed with a scale-invariant distribution
presenting the power-law tail $1/y^{1+\beta_q}$, so that the disorder-averaged
I.P.R. $\bar{Y_q(L)} \sim L^{- \tau_{av}(q)} $ have multifractal exponents
$\tau_{av}(q) $ that differ from the typical ones $\tau_{typ}(q)$ whenever
$\beta_q<1$; (b) the tail exponents $\beta_q$ and the multifractal exponents
are related by the relation $\beta_q \tau_{typ}(q)=\tau_{av}(q \beta_q)$. Here
we show that this scenario can be understood by considering the real-space
renormalization equations satisfied by the I.P.R. For the simplest
multifractals described by random cascades, these renormalization equations are
formally similar to the recursion relations for disordered models defined on
Cayley trees and they admit travelling-wave solutions for the variable $(\ln
Y_q)$ in the effective time $t_{eff}=\ln L$ : the exponent $\tau_{typ}(q)$
represents the velocity, whereas the tail exponent $\beta_q$ represents the
usual exponential decay of the travelling-wave tail. In addition, we obtain
that the relation (b) above can be obtained as a self-consistency condition
from the self-similarity of the multifractal spectrum at all scales. Our
conclusion is thus that the Mirlin-Evers scenario should apply to other types
of random critical points, and even to random multifractals occurring in other
fields.

measurements from HII regions as well as with theoretical stellar yields and
chemical evolution models, a much higher DY/DZ~10 is necessary to reproduce the
broadening observed for nearby subdwarfs. This result resembles, on a milder
scale, the very high DY/DZ estimated from the multiple Main Sequences in Omega
Cen and NGC 2808. Although not ""inverted"" as in omega Cen, where the metal-rich
Main Sequence is bluer than the metal-poor one, the broadening observed for
nearby subdwarfs is much narrower than stellar models predict for a standard
helium content. We use this empirical evidence to argue that a revision of
lower Main Sequence stellar models, suggested from nearby stars, could
significantly reduce the helium content inferred for the subpopulations of
those globular clusters. A simple formula based on empirically calibrated
homology relations is constructed, for an alternative estimate of DY/DZ in

a spatially extended nucleation process which took place at the end of a
pre-cosmic phase, characterized by the evolution parameter x0. This parameter,
which can be considered a quantum precursor of ordinary physical time, is a
coordinate of Euclidean 5-sphere metrics. We must now examine what the
privileged role of the x0 axis consists in. The big bang is a sort of
nucleation of matter and fields by vacuum; to try to understand it we must
therefore make some assumptions regarding a pre-cosmic state of matter and
energy. The introduction of an evolution parameter such as x0 which can be
extended to pre-big bang situations is absolutely necessary if we are to define
any pre-cosmic dynamics. A generalized Bekenstein relation is here proposed for
archaic Universe. A complete solution to Projective General Relativity (PGR)
equations in the De Sitter Universe is provided, so as to establish univocal
relations between the scale factor R(tau) and cosmic time tau. In this way, the

conducting liquid drop in a strong uniform DC magnetic field. An asymptotic
solution is obtained showing that the magnetic field does not affect the shape
eigenmodes, which remain the spherical harmonics as in the non-magnetic case.
Strong magnetic field, however, constrains the liquid flow associated with the
oscillations and, thus, reduces the oscillation frequencies by increasing
effective inertia of the liquid. In such a field, liquid oscillates in a
two-dimensional (2D) way as solid columns aligned with the field. Two types of
oscillations are possible: longitudinal and transversal to the field. Such
oscillations are weakly damped by a strong magnetic field - the stronger the
field, the weaker the damping, except for the axisymmetric transversal and
inherently 2D modes. The former are overdamped because of being incompatible
with the incompressibility constraint, whereas the latter are not affected at
all because of being naturally invariant along the field. Since the magnetic
damping for all other modes decreases inversely with the square of the field
strength, viscous damping may become important in a sufficiently strong
magnetic field. The viscous damping is found analytically by a simple energy
dissipation approach which is shown for the longitudinal modes to be equivalent
to a much more complicated eigenvalue perturbation technique. This study
provides a theoretical basis for the development of new measurement methods of
surface tension, viscosity and the electrical conductivity of liquid metals
using the oscillating drop technique in a strong superimposed DC magnetic
field.

between infrared luminosities determined with the 7.7 um PAH feature and

determine obscuration in starbursts and dependence of this obscuration on
infrared or ultraviolet luminosity. A strong selection effect arises for the
ultraviolet-selected samples: the brightest sources appear bright because they
have the least obscuration. Obscuration correction for the ultraviolet-selected

of total bolometric luminosity L_{ir} to M(UV) is also determined for

galaxies, log L_{ir} = -(0.33+-0.04)M(UV)+4.52+-0.69. For the full

about -17, with decreasing correction for more luminous sources.

spread. They are usually studied at the mean-field level by neglecting
fluctuations. Here we include fluctuations in the models by adopting fully
stochastic descriptions of the corresponding processes. This level of
description allows to address analytically, in the SIS and SIR cases, problems
such as the existence and the calculation of an effective threshold for the
spread of a disease at a global level. We show that the possibility of the
spread at the global level is described in terms of (bond) percolation on the
network. This mapping enables us to give an estimate (lower bound) for the

tail of gas just exiting the disrupted 6-7 keV primary cluster. From the sharp
jump in the temperature and density of the gas, we determine that the
subcluster is preceded by a bow shock with a Mach number M=2.2+/-0.8,
corresponding to a velocity v=2200^{+1000}_{-900} km/s relative to the main

0.1-0.3 Gyr ago. In addition, we observe a slower upstream shock propagating
through the outer region of the primary cluster and calculate a Mach number
M=1.7+/-0.3. Based on the measured shock Mach numbers M~2 and the strength of
the upstream shock, we argue that the mass ratio between the two merging
clusters is between 3 and 4 to one. By comparing the Chandra observation with
an archival HST observation, we find that a group of galaxies is located in

atoms) distribution in the heliosphere. We study influence of the heliospheric
interface, that is the region of the interaction between solar wind and local
interstellar medium, on the distribution of the hydrogen atoms in vicinity of
the Sun. The distribution of H atoms obtained in the frame of the
self-consistent kinetic-gasdynamic model of the heliospheric interface is
compared with a simplified model which assumes Maxwellian distribution of H
atoms at the termination shock and is called often as 'hot' model. This
comparison shows that the distribution of H atoms is significantly affected by
the heliospheric interface not only at large heliocentric distances, but also
in vicinity of the Sun at 1-5 AU. Hence, for analysis of experimental data
connected with direct or undirect measurements of the interstellar atoms one
necessarily needs to take into account effects of the heliospheric interface.
In this paper we propose a new model that is relatively simple but takes into
account all major effects of the heliospheric interface. This model can be
applied for analysis of backscattered Ly-alpha radiation data obtained on board
of different spacecraft.

the detailed reproduction of the pion and kaon momentum spectra and femtoscopic

maximal energy density at supposed thermalization time 1 fm/c and the strength
of the pre-thermal flows developed to this time. The quark-gluon plasma and
hadronic gas is supposed to be in complete local equilibrium above the chemical
freeze-out temperature $T_{ch}$ = 165 MeV with the equation of states (EoS) at

coefficient, which describes the generation of a voltage as a result of a
temperature gradient, is spin dependent in a ferromagnet. For a detailed study
of this new source of spins, it is measured in a non-local lateral geometry. We
developed a 3D model that describes the heat, charge and spin transport in this

of 113 flares observed by Swift reveals that the flare phenomenology is
strictly analogous to the prompt gamma-ray emission: high energy flare profiles
rise faster, decay faster and peak before the low energy emission. However,
flares and prompt pulses differ in one crucial aspect: flares evolve with time.
As time proceeds flares become wider, with larger peak lag, lower luminosities
and softer emission. The flare spectral peak energy E_{p,i} evolves to lower
values following an exponential decay which tracks the decay of the flare flux.
The two flares with best statistics show higher than expected isotropic energy
E_{iso} and peak luminosity L_{p,iso} when compared to the E_{p,i}-E_{iso} and
E_{p,i}-L_{iso} prompt correlations. E_{p,i} is found to correlate with L_{iso}
within single flares, giving rise to a time resolved E_{p,i}(t)-L_{iso}(t).
Like prompt pulses, flares define a lag-luminosity relation: L_{p,iso}^{0.3-10
keV} t_{lag}^{-0.95+/-0.23}. The lag-luminosity is proven to be a fundamental
law extending 5 decades in time and 5 in energy. Moreover, this is direct
evidence that GRB X-ray flares and prompt gamma-ray pulses are produced by the
same mechanism. Finally we establish a flare-afterglow morphology connection:
flares are preferentially detected superimposed to one-break or canonical X-ray
afterglows.

results on an epitaxial graphene monolayer on SiC(0001) suggested the presence
of a large Rashba-type spin splitting of \Delta k=(0.030+-0.005)1/A [1].
Although this value was orders of magnitude larger than predicted
theoretically, it could be reconciled with the line width found in conventional
spin-integrated high resolution angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) data. Here we present novel measurements for a hydrogen intercalated
quasi free-standing graphene monolayer on SiC(0001) that reveal a spin
polarization signal that - when interpreted in terms of the Rashba-Bychkov
effect [2,3] - corresponds to a spin splitting of \Delta k=(0.024+-0.005)1/A.
This splitting is significantly larger than the half width at half maximum of
spin-integrated high resolution ARPES measurements which is a strong indication
that the measured polarization signal does not originate from a Rashba-type
spin splitting of the graphene pi-bands as we suggested in our previous report
[1].

  The fractional derivative models time delays in a diffusion process. We will
give a survey of the recent results on the fractional Cauchy problem and its
generalizations on bounded domains $D\subset \rd$ obtained in \citet{m-n-v-aop,

first time derivative is replaced with an infinite sum of fractional
derivatives. We point out a connection to eigenvalue problems for the
fractional time operators considered. The solutions to the eigenvalue problems
are expressed by Mittag-Leffler functions and its generalized versions. The
stochastic solution of the eigenvalue problems for the fractional derivatives
are given by inverse subordinators.

(NCGG), which generalizes the well-known common goods game. We focus on a
fairly general subclass of the game where each agent's utility functions are
the same across all goods the agent is entitled to and satisfy certain natural
properties (diminishing return and smoothness). We give a comprehensive set of
technical results listed as follows.
  * We show the optimization problem faced by a single agent can be solved
efficiently in this subclass. The discrete version of the problem is however
NP-hard but admits an fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS).
  * We show uniqueness results of pure strategy Nash equilibrium of NCGG, and
that the equilibrium is fully characterized by the structure of the network and
independent of the choices and combinations of agent utility functions.
  * We show NCGG is a potential game, and give an implementation of best/better
response Nash dynamics that lead to fast convergence to an
$\epsilon$-approximate pure strategy Nash equilibrium.
  * Lastly, we show the price of anarchy of NCGG can be as large as
$\Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})$ (for any $\epsilon>0$), which means selfish behavior
in NCGG can lead to extremely inefficient social outcomes.

The flavor ratio of astrophysical neutrinos observed on the Earth depends on
both the initial flavor ratio at the source and flavor transitions taking place
during propagations of these neutrinos. We propose a model independent
parametrization for describing the above flavor transitions. A few flavor
transition models are employed to test our parametrization. The observational
test for flavor transition mechanisms through our parametrization is discussed.

solves some of the usual overfitting and scalability issues of the existing
