classical waves in disordered media is reviewed. After presenting the basic
concepts of the theory of Anderson localization in the case of electrons in
disordered solids, the regimes of weak and strong localization are discussed.
Then the scaling theory of the Anderson localization transition is reviewed.
The renormalization group theory is introduced and results and consequences are
presented. It is shown how scale-dependent terms in the renormalized
perturbation theory of the inverse diffusion coefficient lead in a natural way
to a self-consistent equation for the diffusion coefficient. The latter
accounts quantitatively for the static and dynamic transport properties except
for a region near the critical point. Several recent applications and
extensions of the self-consistent theory, in particular for classical waves,
are discussed.

Rayleigh-Benard convection and Homogeneous Rayleigh-Benard convection. The
predicted angular momentum transport properties of the turbulence in the slowly
rotating case recover the well-known Lambda-effect, with an amplitude uniquely
related to the convective heat flux. The model is then extended to the
anelastic case as well as the fully compressible case. In the special case of
spherical symmetry, the predicted radial heat flux is equivalent to that of
mixing-length theory. For rotating stars, our model describes the coupled
transport of heat and angular momentum, and provides a unified formalism in
which to study both differential rotation and thermal inhomogeneities in

little study of whether these mechanisms formally satisfy appropriate policies

major concern for anyone develops software. Software developers also worry
about their applications being reverse engineered by extracting data structures
and algorithms from an application and incorporated into competitor's code. A
defense against software piracy is watermarking, a process that embeds a secret
message in a cover software. Watermarking is a method that does not aim to stop
piracy copying, but to prove ownership of the software and possibly even the
data structures and algorithms used in the software. The language Java was
designed to be compiled into a platform independent bytecode format. Much of
the information contained in the source code remains in the bytecode, which
means that decompilation is easier than with traditional native codes. In this
thesis, we present a technique for watermarking Java programs by using a
never-executed dummy method (Monden et.al., 2000) combined with opaque
predicates (Collberg et.al., 1998; Arboit, 2002) and improved with dynamically
opaque predicates (Palsberg et.al., 2000). This work presents a method to
construct a dynamic opaque predicates by grouping two or more opaque predicates
according to predefined rules. Any software watermarking technique will exhibit
a trade-off between resilience, data rate, cost, and stealth. To evaluate the
quality of a watermarking scheme we must also know how well it stands up to
different types of attacks. Ideally, we would like our watermarks to survive
translation (compilation, decompilation, and binary translation), optimization,
and obfuscation. Add a single watermark will increasing source code approximate
3.854 bytes with dummy method that cover up to 15 characters, two dynamic data
structures, two threads and two opaque predicates. Application loading-time
increase approximate 6108 milliseconds.

can also be understood in a more general context. The DC Josephson effect is
the pseudo-Goldstone boson of two coupled systems with a broken continuous
abelian U(1) symmetry. Hence, an analog should exist for systems with broken
continuous non-Abelian symmetries. To exhibit the generality of the phenomenon
and make predictions from a realistic model, we study tunneling between
antiferromagnets and also between antiferromagnetic d-wave superconductors.
Performing a calculation analogous to that of Ambegaokar and Baratoff for the
Josephson junction, we find an equilibrium current of the staggered
magnetization through the junction that, in antiferromagnets, is proportional
to s_L X s_R where s_L and s_R are the Neel vectors on either sides of the
junction. Microscopically, this effect exists because of the coherent tunneling
of spin-one particle-hole pairs. In the presence of a magnetic field which is
different on either sides of the junction, we find an analog of the AC
Josephson effect where the angle between Neel vectors depends on time. In the
case of antiferromagnetic d-wave superconductors we predict that there is a
contribution to the critical current that depends on the antiferromagnetic
order and a contribution to the spin-critical current that depends on
superconducting order. The latter contributions come from tunneling of the
triplet Cooper pair that is necessarily present in the ground state of an
antiferromagnetic d-wave superconductor. All these effects appear to leading
order in the square of the tunneling matrix elements.

afterglow of the bright Fermi/LAT GRB 090926A. The spectrum shows prominent
Lyman-alpha absorption with N_HI = 10^(21.73 +/- 0.07) cm^-2 and a multitude of
metal lines at a common redshift of z=2.1062 +/- 0.0004, which we associate
with the redshift of the GRB. The metallicity derived from SII is log(Z/Z_sun)
~ -1.9, one of the lowest values ever found in a GRB Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA)
system. This confirms that the spread of metallicity in GRB-DLAs at z~2 is at
least two orders of magnitude. We argue that this spread in metallicity does
not require a similar range in abundances of the GRB progenitors, since the
neutral interstellar medium probed by the DLA is expected to be at a
significant distance from the explosion site. The hydrogen column density
derived from Swift/XRT afterglow spectrum (assuming log(Z/Z_sun) ~ -1.9) is
approx. 100 times higher than the N_HI obtained from the Lyman-alpha
absorptions. This suggests either a large column density of ionized gas or a
higher metallicity of the circum-burst medium compared to the gas traced by the
DLA. We also discuss the afterglow light curve evolution and energetics. The
absence of a clear jet-break like steeping until at least 21 days post-burst
suggests a beaming corrected energy release of E_gamma>3.5x10^52erg, indicating
that GRB090926A may have been one of the most energetic bursts ever detected.

theory maintains that just M = K log N random linear signal measurements will
both preserve all of the signal information and enable robust signal
reconstruction in polynomial time. In this paper, we extend the CS theory to
pulse stream data, which correspond to S-sparse signals/images that are
convolved with an unknown F-sparse pulse shape. Ignoring their convolutional
structure, a pulse stream signal is K=SF sparse. Such signals figure
prominently in a number of applications, from neuroscience to astronomy. Our
specific contributions are threefold. First, we propose a pulse stream signal
model and show that it is equivalent to an infinite union of subspaces. Second,
we derive a lower bound on the number of measurements M required to preserve
the essential information present in pulse streams. The bound is linear in the
total number of degrees of freedom S + F, which is significantly smaller than
the naive bound based on the total signal sparsity K=SF. Third, we develop an
efficient signal recovery algorithm that infers both the shape of the impulse
response as well as the locations and amplitudes of the pulses. The algorithm
alternatively estimates the pulse locations and the pulse shape in a manner
reminiscent of classical deconvolution algorithms. Numerical experiments on
synthetic and real data demonstrate the advantages of our approach over

increasing signal-to-noise and image depth. A modification of this simple
technique has been applied to the detection of minor bodies in the Solar
System: first stationary objects are removed through the subtraction of a
high-SN template image, then the sky motion of the Solar System bodies of
interest is predicted and compensated for by shifting pixels in software prior
to the co-addition step. This ""shift-and-stack"" approach has been applied with
great success in directed surveys for minor Solar System bodies. In these
surveys, the shifts have been parameterized in a variety of ways. However,
these parameterizations have not been optimized and in most cases cannot be
effectively applied to data sets with long observation arcs due to objects'
real trajectories diverging from linear tracks on the sky. This paper presents
two novel probabilistic approaches for determining a near-optimum set of
shift-vectors to apply to any image set given a desired region of orbital space
to search. The first method is designed for short observational arcs, and the
second for observational arcs long enough to require non-linear shift-vectors.
Using these techniques and other optimizations, we derive optimized grids for
previous surveys that have used ""shift-and-stack"" approaches to illustrate the
improvements that can be made with our method, and at the same time derive new
limits on the range of orbital parameters these surveys searched. We conclude
with a simulation of a future applications for this approach with LSST, and
show that combining multiple nights of data from such next-generation
facilities is within the realm of computational feasibility.

Evolution COde), aimed at a better understanding of when and how the two
processes of star formation and galaxy assembly have taken place. Our model is
structured into a Monte Carlo algorithm based on the Extended Press-Schechter
theory, for the representation of the merging hierarchy of dark matter halos,
and a set of analytic algorithms for the treatment of the baryonic physics,
including classical recipes for the gas cooling, the star formation
time-scales, galaxy mergers and SN feedback. Together with the galaxies, the
parallel growth of BHs is followed in time and their feedback on the hosting
galaxies is modelled. We set the model free parameters by matching with data on
local stellar mass functions and the BH-bulge relation at z=0. Based on such
local boundary conditions, we investigate how data on the high-redshift
universe constrain our understanding of the physical processes driving the
evolution, focusing in particular on the assembly of stellar mass and on the
star formation history. Since both processes are currently strongly constrained
by cosmological near- and far-IR surveys, the basic physics of the Lambda CDM
hierarchical clustering concept of galaxy formation can be effectively tested
by us by comparison with the most reliable set of observables. Our
investigation shows that when the time-scales of the stellar formation and mass
assembly are studied as a function of dark matter halo mass and the single
galaxy stellar mass, the 'downsizing' fashion of star formation appears to be a
natural outcome of the model, reproduced even in the absence of the AGN
feedback. On the contrary, the stellar mass assembly history turns out to
follow a more standard hierarchical pattern progressive in cosmic time, with
the more massive systems assembled at late times mainly through dissipationless
mergers.

forming regions by a combination of bubble morphology in 8 $\micronm$ (PAH)
emission and radio recombination line radial velocities. We find 40 star
forming regions associated with our WMAP sources, and determine unique
distances to 31. We interpret the bubbles as evidence for radial expansion. The
radial velocity distribution for each source allows us to measure the intrinsic
speed of a region's expansion. This speed is consistent with the size and age
of the bubbles. The high free-free luminosities, combined with negligible
synchrotron emission, demonstrate that the bubbles are not driven by
supernovae. The kinetic energy of the largest bubbles is a substantial fraction
of that measured in the older superbubbles found by Heiles. We find that the
energy injected into the ISM by our bubbles is similar to that required to
maintain the turbulent motion in the gas disk inside 8 kpc. We report a number
of new star forming regions powered by massive ($\textrm{M}_{*} > 10^4

at sample sizes of 475 (DR5) and 676 (DR7) absorbers, based on two different
published lists of SDSS DLAs. Both samples span roughly the redshift range of
2.2 < z_abs < 5.2, with a mean of z~3.0, and the majority of the DLAs (75%)
below z=3.3. We construct geometric mean spectra in the absorber restframes
ranging from 1240 to ~2800 A, and composite spectra of samples matching the
'DLA' QSOs in i band magnitude and emission redshift z_em, but without
absorption lines. By comparing the slopes of these composite spectra with their
matched counterparts, we find no sign of reddening in the ensemble of the
absorbers from these samples. Owing to both the unprecedently large sizes of
the DLA samples themselves and the non-DLA SDSS QSO sample, from which we can
draw our matching spectra, we can place very tight limits for this
non-detection (<E(B-V)> =-0.0013+-0.0025 (DR5) and <E(B-V)> =-0.0017+-0.0022
(DR7). Interestingly, when applying our technique to the samples of York et.
al. (2006), vandenBerk et al. (2008) (intervening and intrinsic MgII absorbers)
and the smaller DLA-subsample and pool of comparison QSOs of Vladilo et al.
(2008), we do recover their results, i.e. detect the same amount of reddening
as these authors do. Furthermore, we have tested whether subsamples of our
large sample in categories involving the absorbers (HI column densities,
presence or absence of accompanying metal absorption, absorber redshift) or the
background quasars (emission redshift, brightness) do reveal dust extinction,
but found no trends. These results are at odds with both detections of dust
reddening from previous studies, and also with expectations from observations
of high-redshift galaxies. (abridged)

less than 10^9 M_solar and this cutoff has not been explained. It is shown here
that this minimum mass can be predicted using a model that assumes that 1)
inertia is due to Unruh radiation, and 2) this radiation is subject to a
Hubble-scale Casimir effect. The model predicts that as the acceleration of an
object decreases, its inertial mass eventually decreases even faster
stabilising the acceleration at a minimum value, which is close to the observed
cosmic acceleration. When applied to rotating disc galaxies the same model
predicts that they have a minimum rotational acceleration, ie: a minimum
apparent mass of 1.1x10^9 M_solar, close to the observed minimum mass. The
Hubble mass can also be predicted. It is suggested that assumption 1 above

longitudinally polarized electrons from deuterium can in principle be a
relatively clean probe of higher twist quark-quark correlations beyond the
parton model. As first observed by Bjorken and Wolfenstein, the dominant
contribution to the electron polarization asymmetry, proportional to the axial
vector electron coupling, receives corrections at twist-four from the matrix
element of a single four-quark operator. We reformulate the Bjorken/Wolfenstein
argument in a matter suitable for the interpretation of experiments planned at
the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab). In particular, we
observe that because the contribution of the relevant twist four operator
satisfies the Callan-Gross relation, the ratio of parity-violating longitudinal
and transverse cross sections, R_{\gamma Z}, is identical to that for purely
electromagnetic scattering, R_{\gamma}, up to perturbative and power suppressed
contributions. This result simplifies the interpretation of the asymmetry in
terms of other possible novel hadronic and electroweak contributions. We use
the results of MIT Bag Model calculations to estimate contributions of the
relevant twist four operator to the leading term in the asymmetry as a function
of Bjorken x and Q2 . We compare these estimates with possible leading twist
corrections due to violation of charge symmetry in the parton distribution
functions.

Submitted to ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/718/2/1378",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The open cluster M67 has solar metallicity and an age of about 4Gyr. The
turn-off mass is close to the minimum mass for which solar metallicity stars
develop a convective core during main sequence evolution as a result of the
development of hydrogen burning through the CNO-cycle. The morphology of the
color-magnitude-diagram (CMD) of M67 around the turn-off shows a clear
hook-like feature, direct sign that stars close to the turn-off have convective
cores. VandenBerg et al. investigated the possibility of using the morphology
of the M67 turn-off to put constraints on the solar metallicity, particularly
CNO elements, for which solar abundances have been revised downwards by more
than 30% over the last few years. Here, we extend their work filling in the
gaps in their analysis. To this aim, we compute isochrones appropriate for M67
using new (low metallicity) and old (high metallicity) solar abundances and
study whether the characteristic turn-off in the CMD of M67 can be reproduced
or not. We also study the importance of other constitutive physics on
determining the presence of such a hook, particularly element diffusion,
overshooting and nuclear reaction rates. We find that using the new solar
abundance determinations, with low CNO abundances, makes it more difficult to
reproduce the characteristic CMD of M67. This result is in agreement with
results by VandenBerg et al. However, changes in the constitutive physics of
the models, particularly overshooting, can influence and alter this result to
the extent that isochrones constructed with models using low CNO solar
abundances can also reproduce the turn-off morphology in M67. We conclude that
only if all factors affecting the turn-off morphology are completely under
control (and this is not the case), M67 could be used to put constraints on
solar abundances.

contains a Hessian squared term $|D^2u|^2$. We adapt Weinberger's method from
the corresponding free membrane problem, taking the fundamental modes of the
unit ball as trial functions. These solutions are a linear combination of
Bessel and modified Bessel functions.

obtained spectra to the atmospheric cutoff of quasars previously known to show
at least one absorption system at z>1.6 with very strong metal lines (candidate
metal-strong damped Lya systems; cMSDLAs). The BCS/MMT spectra yield precise
estimates of the HI column densities (NHI) of the systems through Voigt profile
analysis of their Lya transitions. Nearly all of the cMSDLAs (41/43) satisfy
the NHI criterion of DLAs, 10^20.3. As a population, these systems have
systematically higher NHI values than DLAs chosen randomly from quasar
sightlines. Combining our NHI measurements with previously measured metal
column densities, we estimate metallicities for the MSDLAs. These systems have
significantly higher values than randomly selected DLAs; at z~2, the MSDLAs
show a median metallicity [M/H] ~ -0.67 that is 0.6dex higher than a
corresponding control sample. This establishes MSDLAs as having amongst the
most metal-rich gas in the high z universe. Our measurements extend the
observed correlation between SiII 1526 equivalent width and the gas metallicity
to higher values. If interpreted as a mass-metallicity relation, this implies
the MSDLAs are the high mass subset of the DLA population. We demonstrate that
dust in the MSDLAs reddens their background quasars, with a median shift in the
spectral slope of Da = 0.29. Assuming an SMC extinction law, this implies a
median reddening E(B-V)=0.025mag and visual extinction A_V=0.076mag. Future
studies of MSDLAs offer the opportunity to study the extinction,
nucleosynthesis, and kinematics of the most chemically evolved, gas-rich
galaxies at high z. [abridged]

mass from these data and compare it with real mass. When the smaller

mass can be larger than twice of the real mass. The results strongly depend on
the observational directions, because of anisotropic velocity distribution of
the member galaxies. We also make the X-ray surface brightness and
spectroscopic-like temperature maps from the simulation data. The mass profile
is estimated from these data on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. In
general, mass estimation with X-ray data gives us better results than virial
mass estimation. The dependence upon observational directions is weaker than in
case of virial mass estimation. When the system is observed along the collision
axis, the projected mass tends to be underestimated. This fact should be noted
especially when the virial and/or X-ray mass are compared with gravitational
lensing results.

iodine cell which contains thousands of well-calibrated iodine lines and
compare these lines to the wavelength scale from the standard thorium-argon
pipeline calibration. Analyzing three exposures of this z = 1.71 QSO, we find
two distinct types of calibration shifts needed to correct the Th/Ar wavelength
scale. First, there is an overall average velocity shift of between 100 m/s and
500 m/s depending upon the exposure. Second, within a given exposure, we find
intra-order velocity distortions of 100 m/s up to more than 200 m/s. These
calibration errors are similar to, but smaller than, those found earlier in the
Keck HIRES spectrometer. We discuss the possible origins of these two types of
miscalibration. We also explore the implications of these calibration errors on
the systematic error in measurements of the relative change in alpha (current
value - past value) / current value, the change in the fine-structure constant
derived from accurate measurement of the relative redshifts of absorption lines
in QSO absorption systems. The overall average, exposure-dependent shifts
should be less relevant for fine-structure work, but the intra-order shifts
have the potential to affect these results. Using either our measured
calibration offsets or a Gaussian model with sigma of around 90 m/s, Monte
Carlo mock experiments find errors in the relative change in alpha of between

random variable from its observation contaminated by Gaussian noise. The MMSE
can be regarded as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as a
functional of the input distribution (of the random variable to be estimated).
It is shown that the MMSE is concave in the input distribution at any given
SNR. For a given input distribution, the MMSE is found to be infinitely
differentiable at all positive SNR, and in fact a real analytic function in SNR
under mild conditions. The key to these regularity results is that the
posterior distribution conditioned on the observation through Gaussian channels
always decays at least as quickly as some Gaussian density. Furthermore, simple
expressions for the first three derivatives of the MMSE with respect to the SNR
are obtained. It is also shown that, as functions of the SNR, the curves for
the MMSE of a Gaussian input and that of a non-Gaussian input cross at most
once over all SNRs. These properties lead to simple proofs of the facts that
Gaussian inputs achieve both the secrecy capacity of scalar Gaussian wiretap
channels and the capacity of scalar Gaussian broadcast channels, as well as a
simple proof of the entropy power inequality in the special case where one of
the variables is Gaussian.

GALEX GR4 source catalog, yielding 304 S/N>3 sources. However, ~50% of these
are only detected in the GALEX NUV band, signaling the truncation of the FUV
flux by low-redshift Lyman limit systems. We exploit the GALEX UV color to cull
the most promising targets for follow-up studies, with blue (red) GALEX colors
indicating transparent (opaque) sightlines. Monte Carlo simulations indicate a
HeII detection rate of ~60% for quasars with FUV-NUV<1 at z<3.5, a ~50%
increase over GALEX searches that do not include color information. We regard
52 quasars detected at S/N>3 to be most promising for HST follow-up, with an
additional 114 quasars if we consider S/N>2 detections in the FUV. SDSS
provides just half of the NUV-bright quasars that should have been detected by
SDSS & GALEX. We revise the SDSS quasar selection function, finding that SDSS
systematically misses quasars with blue u-g<2 colors at 3<z<3.5 due to overlap
with the stellar locus in color space. Our color-dependent SDSS selection
function naturally explains the inhomogeneous u-g color distribution of SDSS
quasars with redshift and the color difference between color-selected and
radio-selected SDSS quasars. Moreover, it yields excellent agreement between
the observed and the predicted number of UV-bright SDSS quasars. We confirm our
previous claims that SDSS preferentially selects 3<z<3.5 quasars with
intervening HI Lyman limit systems. Our results imply that broadband optical
color surveys for 3<z<3.5 quasars have likely underestimated their space
density by selecting IGM sightlines with an excess of strong HI absorbers.

theoretical investigations and practical exploitations of complementary
properties. Much is known about mutually unbiased bases, but there are also a
fair number of important questions that have not been answered in full as yet.
In particular, one can find maximal sets of ${N+1}$ mutually unbiased bases in
Hilbert spaces of prime-power dimension ${N=p^\m}$, with $p$ prime and $\m$ a
positive integer, and there is a continuum of mutually unbiased bases for a
continuous degree of freedom, such as motion along a line. But not a single
example of a maximal set is known if the dimension is another composite number
($N=6,10,12,...$). In this review, we present a unified approach in which the
basis states are labeled by numbers ${0,1,2,...,N-1}$ that are both elements of
a Galois field and ordinary integers. This dual nature permits a compact
systematic construction of maximal sets of mutually unbiased bases when they
are known to exist but throws no light on the open existence problem in other
cases. We show how to use the thus constructed mutually unbiased bases in
quantum-informatics applications, including dense coding, teleportation,
entanglement swapping, covariant cloning, and state tomography, all of which
rely on an explicit set of maximally entangled states (generalizations of the
familiar two--q-bit Bell states) that are related to the mutually unbiased
bases. There is a link to the mathematics of finite affine planes. We also
exploit the one-to-one correspondence between unbiased bases and the complex
Hadamard matrices that turn the bases into each other. The ultimate hope, not

two critical features of social networks of knowledge-based collaboration:
first, they essentially consist of group-level interactions which call for
team-centered approaches. Formally, this induces the use of hypergraphs and
n-adic interactions, rather than traditional dyadic frameworks of interaction
such as graphs, binding only pairs of agents. Second, we advocate the joint
consideration of structural and semantic features, as collaborations are
allegedly constrained by both of them. Considering these provisions, we propose
a framework which principally enables us to empirically test a series of
hypotheses related to academic team formation patterns. In particular, we
exhibit and characterize the influence of an implicit group structure driving
recurrent team formation processes. On the whole, innovative production does
not appear to be correlated with more original teams, while a polarization
appears between groups composed of experts only or non-experts only, altogether
corresponding to collectives with a high rate of repeated interactions.

uncertain, although the collapsar engine of fast-rotating massive stars is
gaining a strong consensus. Aims: We propose that low-metallicity Be and Oe
stars, which are massive fast rotators, as potential LGRBs progenitors.
Methods: We checked this hypothesis by 1) testing the global specific angular
momentum of Oe/Be stars in the ZAMS with the SMC metallicity, 2) comparing the
ZAMS ($\Omega/\Omega_{\rm c},M/M_{\odot}$) parameters of these stars with the
area predicted theoretically for progenitors with metallicity $Z=0.002$, and 3)
calculating the expected rate of LGRBs/year/galaxy and comparing them with the
observed ones. To this end, we determined the ZAMS linear and angular
rotational velocities for SMC Be and Oe stars using the observed vsini
parameters, corrected from the underestimation induced by the gravitational
darkening effect. Results: The angular velocities of SMC Oe/Be stars are on
average $<\Omega/\Omega_{\rm c}>=0.95$ in the ZAMS. These velocities are in the
area theoretically predicted for the LGRBs progenitors. We estimated the yearly
rate per galaxy of LGRBs and the number of LGRBs produced in the local Universe
up to z=0.2. We have considered that the mass range of LGRB progenitors
corresponds to stars hotter than spectral types B0-B1 and used individual
beaming angles from 5 to 15\degr. We thus obtain $R^{\rm pred}_{\rm
LGRB}\sim10^{-7}$ to $\sim10^{-6}$ LGRBs/year/galaxy, which represents on
average 2 to 14 LGRB predicted events in the local Universe during the past 11
years. The predicted rates could widely surpass the observed ones
[(0.2-3)$\times10^{-7}$ LGRBs/year/galaxy; 8 LGRBs observed in the local
Universe during the last 11 years] if the stellar counts were made from the
spectral type B1-B2, in accordance with the expected apparent spectral types of
the appropriate massive fast rotators. Conclusion: We conclude that the massive
Be/Oe stars with SMC metallicity could be LGRBs progenitors. Nevertheless,
other SMC O/B stars without emission lines, which have high enough specific
angular momentum, can enhance the predicted $R_{\rm LGRB}$ rate.

magnetism in graphene would seem unlikely. Nonetheless, magnetism in graphitic

negative curvature regions of the graphene sheet14. Recent experiments suggest
that correlated defects in highly-ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) induced by

local moments which interact strongly with the conduction electrons through the

indeed magnetic. The Kondo temperature TK is tunable with carrier density from

(GRBs) arise naturally when Quark-Novae occur in low-mass X-ray binaries born
with massive neutron stars (> 1.6M_sun) and harboring a circumbinary disk. Near
the end of the first accretion phase, conditions are just right for the
explosive conversion of the neutron star to a quark star (Quark-Nova). In our
model, the subsequent interaction of material from the neutron star's ejected
crust with the circumbinary disk explains the duration, variability and
near-universal nature of the prompt emission in short-hard GRBs. We also
describe a statistical approach to ejecta break-up and collision to obtain the
photon spectrum in our model, which turns out remarkably similar to the
empirical Band function (Band 1993). We apply the model to the fluence and
spectrum of GRB 000727, GRB 000218, and GRB980706A obtaining excellent fits.
Extended emission (spectrum and duration) is explained by shock-heating and
ablation of the white dwarf by the highly energetic ejecta. Depending on the
orbital separation when the Quark-Nova occurs, we isolate interesting regimes
within our model when both prompt and extended emission can occur. We find that
the spectrum can carry signatures typical of Type Ib/c SNe although these
should appear less luminous than normal type Ib/c SNe. Late X-ray activity is
due to accretion onto the quark star as well as its spin-down luminosity.
Afterglow activity arise from the expanding shell of material from the
shock-heated expanding circumbinary disk. We find a correlation between the
duration and spectrum of short-hard GRBs as well as modest hard-to-soft time
evolution of the peak energy.

  We study the following Gallai-type of problem: Assume that we are given a
family X of convex objects in R^d such that among any subset of size m, there
is an axis-parallel hyperplane intersecting at least two of the objects. What
can we say about the number of axis-parallel hyperplanes that sufficient to
intersect all sets in the family?
  In this paper, we show that this number T_d(m) exists, i.e., depends only on
m and the dimension d, but not on the size of the set X. First, we derive a
very weak super-exponential bound. Using this result, by a simple proof we are
able to show that this number is even polynomially bounded for any fixed d.
  We partly answer open problem 74 on http://maven.smith.edu/~orourke/TOPP/,
where the planar case is considered, by improving the best known exponential
bound to O(m^2).

universe. Using the clean separation of the red and blue sequences made
possible by the NUV - r color-magnitude diagram, we segregate the galaxies into
red, blue and intermediate ""green"" classes. We explore the clustering as a
function of this segregation by removing the dependence on luminosity and by
excluding edge-on galaxies as a means of a non-model dependent veto of highly
extincted galaxies. We find that \xi (r_p, \pi) for both red and green galaxies
shows strong redshift space distortion on small scales -- the ""finger-of-God""
effect, with green galaxies having a lower amplitude than is seen for the red
sequence, and the blue sequence showing almost no distortion. On large scales,
\xi (r_p, \pi) for all three samples show the effect of large-scale streaming
from coherent infall. On scales 1 Mpc/h < r_p < 10 Mpc/h, the projected
auto-correlation function w_p(r_p) for red and green galaxies fits a power-law
with slope \gamma ~ 1.93 and amplitude r_0 ~ 7.5 and 5.3, compared with \gamma
~ 1.75 and r_0 ~ 3.9 Mpc/h for blue sequence galaxies. Compared to the
clustering of a fiducial L* galaxy, the red, green, and blue have a relative
bias of 1.5, 1.1, and 0.9 respectively. The w_p(r_p) for blue galaxies display
an increase in convexity at ~ 1 Mpc/h, with an excess of large scale
clustering. Our results suggest that the majority of blue galaxies are likely
central galaxies in less massive halos, while red and green galaxies have
larger satellite fractions, and preferentially reside in virialized structures.
If blue sequence galaxies migrate to the red sequence via processes like
mergers or quenching that take them through the green valley, such a
transformation may be accompanied by a change in environment in addition to any
change in luminosity and color.

induces the somewhat conflicting goals of tracking and attenuation. The

Networks. We call it the PALOMA model, standing for PAssively mobile
LOgarithmic space MAchines. The main modification w.r.t. the Population
Protocol model is that agents now, instead of being automata, are Turing
Machines whose memory is logarithmic in the population size n. Note that the
new model is still easily implementable with current technology. We focus on
complete communication graphs. We define the complexity class PLM, consisting
of all symmetric predicates on input assignments that are stably computable by
the PALOMA model. We assume that the agents are initially identical.
Surprisingly, it turns out that the PALOMA model can assign unique consecutive
ids to the agents and inform them of the population size! This allows us to
give a direct simulation of a Deterministic Turing Machine of O(nlogn) space,
thus, establishing that any symmetric predicate in SPACE(nlogn) also belongs to
PLM. We next prove that the PALOMA model can simulate the Community Protocol
model, thus, improving the previous lower bound to all symmetric predicates in
NSPACE(nlogn). Going one step further, we generalize the simulation of the
deterministic TM to prove that the PALOMA model can simulate a Nondeterministic
TM of O(nlogn) space. Although providing the same lower bound, the important
remark here is that the bound is now obtained in a direct manner, in the sense
that it does not depend on the simulation of a TM by a Pointer Machine.
Finally, by showing that a Nondeterministic TM of O(nlogn) space decides any
language stably computable by the PALOMA model, we end up with an exact
characterization for PLM: it is precisely the class of all symmetric predicates
in NSPACE(nlogn).

bribery, electoral control describes ways of changing the outcome of an
election; unlike manipulation or bribery attempts, control actions---such as
adding/deleting/partitioning either candidates or voters---modify the
participative structure of an election. Via such actions one can try to either
make a favorite candidate win (""constructive control"") or prevent a despised
candidate from winning (""destructive control""). Computational complexity can be
used to protect elections from control attempts, i.e., proving an election
system resistant to some type of control shows that the success of the
corresponding control action, though not impossible, is computationally
prohibitive. We show that fallback voting, an election system combining
approval with majority voting, is resistant to each of the common types of
candidate control and to each common type of constructive control. Among
natural election systems with a polynomial-time winner problem, only plurality
and sincere-strategy preference-based approval voting (SP-AV) were previously
known to be fully resistant to candidate control, and only Copeland voting and
SP-AV were previously known to be fully resistant to constructive control.
However, plurality has fewer resistances to voter control, Copeland voting has
fewer resistances to destructive control, and SP-AV (which like fallback voting
has 19 out of 22 proven control resistances) is arguably less natural a system
than fallback voting.

establishes a correlation between the partial enthalpy of evaporation from
binary solutions, concentrations of components, and equilibrium vapor
pressures. The difference between enthalpies of evaporation of components from
solutions and those from the pure liquids, D(DH), depends on the chemical
nature and concentrations, X, of solutions. The effect of concentrations on
D(DH) makes different appearances in ideal and non-ideal solutions, although,
as a whole, D(DH) increases with the growth of concentration of the second
component. A model is introduced, which considers D(DH) as the sum of energetic
changes of three sequential stages: passage of molecules from the bulk liquid
into the surface layer, exit of the molecules on the outer side of the
interface, and the following desorption into the gas phase. In the framework of
the model, the main contribution to enthalpy of evaporation comes from the
processes in the surface layer. It is suggested that adsorption from solutions,
which changes the chemical composition of the surface layer with respect to
that of the bulk solution, determines, to great extent, the difference in the
forms of the curves D(DH)=f(X) for ideal and non-ideal solutions.

smaller radii with respect to that of a typical present-day early-type galaxy

early-type galaxies were more compact, hence denser, and that as a consequence,
they should have increased their radius across the time to reconcile with the
present-day ones. However, observations have not yet established whether the
population of early-types in the early Universe was fully represented by
compact galaxies nor if they were so much more numerous than in the present-day
Universe to require an evolution of their sizes. Here we report the results of
a study based on a complete sample of 34 early-type galaxies at
0.9<z_{spec}<1.92. We find a majority (62 per cent) of normal early-type
galaxies similar to typical local ones, co-existing with compact early-types
from ~2 to ~6 times smaller in spite of the same mass and redshift. The
co-existence of normal and compact early-type galaxies at <z>~1.5 suggests that
their build-up taken place in the first 3-4 Gyr, followed distinct paths. Also,
we find that the number density of compact early-types at <z>~1.5 is consistent
with the lower limits of the local number density of compact early-types
derived from local clusters of galaxies. The similar number of compact
early-types found in the early and in the present day Universe frustrates the
hypothesized effective radius evolution while provides evidence that also
compact ETGs were as we see them today 9-10 Gyr ago. Finally, the fact that (at
least) most of the compact ETGs at high-z are accounted for by compact
early-types in local cluster of galaxies implies that the former are the direct
progenitors of the compact early-type cluster galaxies establishing a direct
link between environment and early phases of assembly of ETGs.

to the elongation of the C18O (J=1-0) or submillimeter continuum emission. The
bright part of C18O (J=1-0), submillimeter continuum cores as well as many
class 0/I objects are located just toward the constriction region of the
hourglass-shaped magnetic field. Applying the CF method, the magnetic field
strength was estimated to be ~100 muG, suggesting that the ambient region of
the Serpens cloud core is moderately magnetically supercritical. These suggest
that the Serpens cloud core first contracted along the magnetic field to be an
elongated cloud, which is perpendicular to the magnetic field, and that then
the central part contracted cross the magnetic field due to the high density in
the central region of the cloud core, where star formation is actively
continuing. Comparison of this magnetic field with the previous observations of
molecular gas and large-scale outflows suggests a possibility that the cloud
dynamics is controlled by the magnetic field, protostellar outflows and
gravitational inflows. This appears to be in good agreement with the
outflow-driven turbulence model and implies the importance of the magnetic
field to continuous star formation in the center region of the cluster forming
region.

buildings is well known as is the relationship between formal completions in
one direction and affine buildings. Nevertheless, as the completion of a
Kac-Moody group in one direction destroys the opposite BN-pair, there exists no
longer a twin building. For similar reasons, there are so far no buildings at
all for analytic completions of affine Kac-Moody groups. In this article we
construct a new type of twin buildings, called twin cities, that are associated
to affine analytic Kac-Moody groups over the real or complex numbers. Twin
cities consist of two sets of buildings. We describe applications of cities in
infinite dimensional differential geometry by proving infinite dimensional
versions of classical results from finite dimensional differential geometry:
For example, we show that points in an isoparametric submanifold in a Hilbert
space correspond to all chambers in a city. In a sequel we will describe the
theory of twin cities for formal completions.

as R&D collaborations. In this study we focus on cross-region R&D
collaborations in Europe. The European coverage is achieved by using data on
collaborative R&D projects funded by the EU Framework Programmes (FPs) between
organisation that are located in 255 NUTS-2 regions of the 25 pre-2007 EU
member-states, as well as Norway and Switzerland. The objective is to identify
separation effects - such as geographical or technological effects - on the
constitution of cross-region collaborative R&D activities. We specify a Poisson
spatial interaction model to analyse these questions. The dependent variable is
the intensity of cross-region R&D collaborations, the independent variables
include origin, destination and separation characteristics of interaction. The
results provide striking evidence that geographical effects play an important
role in determining R&D collaborations across Europe. Geographical proximity
and co-localisation of organisations in neighbouring regions are important
determinants of cross-region collaboration intensities. The effect of
technological proximity is stronger than spatial effects. R&D collaborations
occur most often between organisations that are located close to each other in
technological space. R&D collaborations in Europe are also affected by
language- and country border effects, but these are smaller than geographical

contains at least two stellar populations. The separation in magnitude has been
ascribed to an age difference of ~6 Gyr and interpreted as the result of an
atypical evolutionary history for this cluster. We show that the observed HB
morphology is also consistent with a model in which the bright HB is composed
of second generation stars that are metal enriched and with a helium mass
fraction larger (by delta Y ~ 0.07) than that of first generation stars
populating the fainter part of the HB. Terzan 5 would therefore be anomalous,
compared to most ""normal"" clusters hosting multiple populations, only because
its second generation is strongly contaminated by supernova ejecta; the
previously proposed prolonged period of star formation, however, is not
required. The iron enrichment of the bright HB can be ascribed either to
contamination from Type Ia supernova ejecta of the low-iron, helium rich,
ejecta of the massive asympotic giant branch stars of the cluster, or to its
mixing with gas, accreting on the cluster from the environment, that has been
subject to fast metal enrichment due to its proximity with the galactic bulge.
The model here proposed requires only a small age difference, of ~100Myr.

Reduced dynamics of the qubit is studied in terms of the rigorous Davies

pure dephasing coupling, the geometric phase varies monotonically with respect
to the polar angle (in the Bloch sphere representation) parameterizing an

of dissipative coupling for which the variation of the geometric phase with

and is not antisymmetric. Sensitivity of the geometric phase to details of the

excitation potential, wavelength, and line strength was analyzed, along with
the depression contribution functions. The line shifts were found to depend on
the location of the line formation region in convective cells and the
difference between the line depression contributions from granules and
intergranular lanes. In visible spectrum the weak and moderate lines are formed
deep in the photosphere. Their effective line formation region is located in
the central parts of granules, which make the major contribution to the
absorption of spatially unresolved lines. The cores of strong lines are formed
in upper photospheric layers where is formed reversed granulation due to
convection reversal and physical conditions change drastically there. As a
consequence the depression contributions in the strong line from intergranular
lanes with downflows substantially increase. This accounts for smaller blue
shifts of strong lines. In infrared spectrum the observed decrease in the blue
line shifts is explained by the fact that their effective line formation
regions lie higher in the photosphere and extend much further into the reversed
granulation region due to the line opacity rise with the increase of line
wavelength. Additionally the effective line formation depths of the synthesized
visible and infrared Fe I lines and their dependence on line parameters is
discussed.

(76 data points) demonstrate distinct brightness variations of the source

with the previous estimates obtained by Schechter et al. in 1997 - 24.7d
between B and C and 9.4d between (A1+A2) and C. The new values of time delays
in PG 1115+080 must result in larger values for the Hubble constant, thus
reducing difference between its estimates taken from the gravitational lenses
and with other methods. Also, we analyzed variability of the A2/A1 flux ratio,
as well as color changes in the archetypal ""fold"" lens PG 1115+080. We found
the A1/A2 flux ratio to grow during 2001-2006 and to be larger at longer

2006. We also present evidence that both the A1 and A2 images might have
undergone microlensing during 2001-2006, with the descending phase for A1 and

temperature (T<T^chi_c) with C- and CP-violations, indicated by the nonzero
chiral-chemical potential (mu_chi>0), i.e. the chiral-magnetic effect (CME).
For this purpose, we employ the instanton-vacuum configuration at finite T with
nonzero topological charge (Q_t>0). From the numerical calculations, it turns
out that the longitudinal component of the connected VCC is liner in B_0 and
shows a bump, representing a corresponding vector meson at |Q|=(300~400) MeV
for T=0. The bump becomes enhanced as T increases and the bump position shifts
to a lager |Q| value. In the limit of |Q|->0, the transverse component of the
connected VCC disappears, whereas the longitudinal one remains finite and gets
insensitive to B_0 with respect to T, due to diluting instanton contributions.
Considering a simple collision geometry of HIC and some assumptions on the
induced magnetic field and screening effect, we can estimate the charge
separation (ChS) as a function of centrality using the present results for VCC.
The numerical results show a qualitative agreement with experiments for the
Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions. These results are almost independent on the source
of CME, instanton or sphaleron, as long as the CME current is linear in B_0.

analyzing the Taylor-Goldstein equation theoretically. According to this
analysis, the stable stratification $N^2\geq0$ has a destabilization mechanism,
and the flow instability is due to the competition of the kinetic energy with
the potential energy, which is dominated by the total Froude number $Fr_t^2$.
Globally, $Fr_t^2 \leq 1$ implies that the total kinetic energy is smaller than
the total potential energy. So the potential energy might transfer to the
kinetic energy after being disturbed, and the flow becomes unstable. On the
other hand, when the potential energy is smaller than the kinetic energy
($Fr_t^2>1$), the flow is stable because no potential energy could transfer to
the kinetic energy. The flow is more stable with the velocity profile
$U'/U'''>0$ than that with $U'/U'''<0$. Besides, the unstable perturbation must
be long-wave scale. Locally, the flow is unstable as the gradient Richardson
number $Ri>1/4$. These results extend the Rayleigh's, Fj{\o}rtoft's, Sun's and
Arnol'd's criteria for the inviscid homogenous fluid, but they contradict the
well-known Miles-Howard theorem. It is argued here that the transform
$F=\phi/(U-c)^n$ is not suitable for temporal stability problem, and that it
will lead to contradictions with the results derived from the Taylor-Goldstein
equation. However, such transform might be useful for the study of the
Orr-Sommerfeld equation in viscous flows.

the simulation takes place on a specific subset of configurations of T

automaton able to simulate any other in a large class containing arbitrarily
complex ones. We also consider the case of subshifts and, using arguments from

model with four generations (SM4) and a real gauge-singlet scalar called
darkon, D, as the weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark-matter (DM)
candidate. We explore constraints on the darkon sector of the SM4+D from WIMP
DM direct-search experiments, including CDMS II and CoGeNT, and from the decay
of a B meson into a kaon plus missing energy. We find that a sizable portion of
the darkon parameter space is still compatible with the experimental data.
Since the darkon-Higgs interaction may give rise to considerable enhancement of
the Higgs invisible decay mode, the existence of the darkon could lead to the
weakening or evasion of some of the restrictions on the Higgs mass in the
presence of fourth-generation quarks. In addition, it can affect the
flavor-changing decays of these new heavy quarks into a lighter quark and the
Higgs boson, as the Higgs may subsequently decay invisibly. Therefore we also
study these flavor-changing neutral transitions involving the darkon, as well
as the corresponding top-quark decay t -> cDD, some of which may be observable
at the Tevatron or LHC and thus provide additional tests for the SM4+D.

high-frequency AC magnetic field. An energy variation principle is derived in
terms of the surface integral of the scalar magnetic potential. This principle
is applied to a thin perfectly conducting liquid disk, which is used to model
the drops constrained in a horizontal gap between two parallel insulating
plates. Firstly, the stability of a circular disk is analysed with respect to
small-amplitude harmonic edge perturbations. Analytical solution shows that the
edge deformations with the azimuthal wavenumbers m=2,3,4... start to develop as
the magnetic Bond number exceeds the critical threshold Bm_c=3pi(m+1)/2. The
most unstable is m=2 mode, which corresponds to an elliptical deformation.
Secondly, strongly deformed equilibrium shapes are modelled numerically by
minimising the associated energy in combination with the solution of a surface
integral equation for the scalar magnetic potential on an unstructured
triangular mesh. The edge instability is found to result in the equilibrium
shapes of either two- or threefold rotational symmetry depending on the
magnetic field strength and the initial perturbation. The shapes of higher
rotational symmetries are unstable and fall back to one of these two basic
states. The developed method is both efficient and accurate enough for
modelling of strongly deformed drop shapes.

tool for studying the effects of nucleosynthesis and mixing in the interior of
low- to intermediate mass stars during their final evolutionary phases. The
atmospheres of AGB stars can be strongly affected by stellar pulsation and the
development of a stellar wind, though, and the abundance determination of these
objects should therefore be based on dynamic model atmospheres. We investigate
the effects of stellar pulsation and mass loss on the appearance of selected
spectral features (line profiles, line intensities) and on the derived
elemental abundances by performing a systematic comparison of hydrostatic and
dynamic model atmospheres. High-resolution synthetic spectra in the near
infrared range were calculated based on two dynamic model atmospheres (at
various phases during the pulsation cycle) as well as a grid of hydrostatic
COMARCS models. Equivalent widths of a selection of atomic and molecular lines
were derived in both cases and compared with each other. In the case of the
dynamic models, the equivalent widths of all investigated features vary over
the pulsation cycle. A consistent reproduction of the derived variations with a
set of hydrostatic models is not possible, but several individual phases and
spectral features can be reproduced well with the help of specific hydrostatic
atmospheric models. In addition, we show that the variations in equivalent
width that we found on the basis of the adopted dynamic model atmospheres agree
qualitatively with observational results for the Mira R Cas over its light
cycle. The findings of our modelling form a starting point to deal with the
problem of abundance determination in strongly dynamic AGB stars (i.e.,
long-period variables).

concentration properties on higher dimensions. We consider unbounded spin
systems on the d-dimensional lattice with interactions that increase slower
than a quadratic. At first we assume that the one site measure satisfies a
Modified log-Sobolev inequality with a constant uniformly on the boundary
conditions and we determine conditions so that the infinite dimensional Gibbs
measure satisfies a concentration as well as a Talagrand type inequality. Then
a Modified Log-Sobolev type concentration property is obtained under weaker
conditions referring to the Log-Sobolev inequalities for the boundary free
measure.

Suppose the distribution is supported in a centered Euclidean ball of radius
\sqrt{n}. We conjecture that the optimal sample size is N = O(n) for all
distributions with finite fourth moment, and we prove this up to an iterated
logarithmic factor. This problem is motivated by the optimal theorem of
Rudelson which states that N = O(n \log n) for distributions with finite second

evidenced a cavity at ~ 46 AU in radius into the proto-planetary disk around
the T Tauri star LkCa15 (V1079 Tau), located in the Taurus molecular cloud.
Additional Spitzer observations have corroborated this result possibly
explained by the presence of a massive (>= 5 MJup) planetary mass, a brown
dwarf or a low mass star companion at about 30 AU from the star. We used the
most recent developments of high angular resolution and high contrast imaging
to search directly for the existence of this putative companion, and to bring
new constraints on its physical and orbital properties. The NACO adaptive
optics instrument at VLT was used to observe LkCa15 using a four quadrant phase
mask coronagraph to access small angular separations at relatively high
contrast. A reference star at the same parallactic angle was carefully observed
to optimize the quasi-static speckles subtraction (limiting our sensitivity at
less than 1.0). Although we do not report any positive detection of a faint
companion that would be responsible for the observed gap in LkCa15's disk
(25-30 AU), our detection limits start constraining its probable mass,
semi-major axis and eccentricity. Using evolutionary model predictions, Monte
Carlo simulations exclude the presence of low eccentric companions with masses
M >= 6 M Jup and orbiting at a >= 100 AU with significant level of confidence.
For closer orbits, brown dwarf companions can be rejected with a detection
probability of 90% down to 80 AU (at 80% down to 60 AU). Our detection limits
do not access the star environment close enough to fully exclude the presence
of a brown dwarf or a massive planet within the disk inner activity (i.e at
less than 30 AU). Only, further and higher contrast observations should unveil
the existence of this putative companion inside the LkCa15 disk.

investigated by the tight-binding model. Two groups of asymmetric LLs lead to
two kinds of absorption peaks resulting from only intragroup excitations. Each
absorption peak obeys a single selection rule similar to that of monolayer
graphene. The excitation channel of each peak is changed as the field strength
approaches a critical strength. This alteration of the excitation channel is
strongly related to the setting of the Fermi level. The peculiar optical
properties can be attributed to the characteristics of the LL wave functions of
the two LL groups. A detailed comparison of optical properties between
AA-stacked and AB-stacked bilayer graphenes is also offered. The compared
results demonstrate that the optical properties are strongly dominated by the
stacking symmetry. Furthermore, the presented results may be used to
discriminate AABG from MG, which can be hardly done by STM.

Wavevectors which are oriented parallel to the applied magnetic field are
