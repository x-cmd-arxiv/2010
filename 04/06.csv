Waerden's theorem, and (boolean, CNF) SAT solving. We aim at using the problems
from exact Ramsey theory, concerned with computing Ramsey-type numbers, as a
rich source of test problems, where especially methods for solving hard
problems can be developed. In order to control the growth of the problem
instances, we introduce ""transversal extensions"" as a natural way of
constructing mixed parameter tuples (k_1, ..., k_m) for van-der-Waerden-like
numbers N(k_1, ..., k_m), such that the growth of these numbers is guaranteed
to be linear. Based on Green-Tao's theorem we introduce the ""Green-Tao numbers""
grt(k_1, ..., k_m), which in a sense combine the strict structure of van der
Waerden problems with the (pseudo-)randomness of the distribution of prime
numbers. Using standard SAT solvers (look-ahead, conflict-driven, and local
search) we determine the basic values. It turns out that already for this
single form of Ramsey-type problems, when considering the best-performing
solvers a wide variety of solver types is covered. For m > 2 the problems are
non-boolean, and we introduce the ""generic translation scheme"", which offers an
infinite variety of translations (""encodings"") and covers the known methods. In
most cases the special instance called ""nested translation"" proved to be far
superior.

of type O8. We compare this result with that based on the stellar Lyman

High-excitation Blobs (HEBs). N66A most probably represents a very young

group on momentum eigenstates is deformed to preserve a maximal momenta or
minimal length, supposed equal to the Planck length. The classical and quantum
dynamics of a particle propagating in kappa-Minkowski spacetime is discussed in
order to examine an apparent paradox of locality which arises in the classical
dynamics. This is due to the fact that the Lorentz transformations of spacetime
positions of particles depend on their energies, so whether or not a local
event, defined by the coincidence of two or more particles, takes place appears
to depend on the frame of reference of the observer. Here it is proposed that
the paradox arises only in the classical picture, and may be resolved when the
quantum dynamics is taken into account. If so, the apparent paradoxes arise
because it is inconsistent to study physics in which Planck's constant is zero
but the Planck length is non-vanishing. This may be relevant for phenomenology
such as observations by FERMI, because at leading order there is both a direct
and a stochastic dependence of arrival time on energy, due to an additional
spreading of wavepackets.

quantum systems with the help of a scalable ancillary quantum control and
techniques from geometric control theory, in order to successfully and
completely decouple an open quantum system from its environment. We
re-formulate the problem of decoherence control as a disturbance rejection
scheme which also leads us to the idea of Internal Model Principle for quantum
control systems which is first of its kind in the literature.
  It is shown that decoupling a quantum disturbance from an open quantum
system, is possible only with the help of a quantum controller which takes into
account the model of the environmental interaction. This is demonstrated for a
simple 2-qubit system wherein the effects of decoherence are completely
eliminated. The theory provides conditions to be imposed on the controller to
ensure perfect decoupling. Hence the problem of decoherence control naturally
gives rise to the quantum internal model principle which relates the
disturbance rejecting control to the model of the environmental interaction.
  Classical internal model principle and disturbance decoupling focus on
different aspects viz. perfect output tracking and complete decoupling of
output from external disturbances respectively. However for quantum systems,
the two problems come together and merge in order to produce an effective
platform for decoherence control. In this article we introduce a seminal
connection between disturbance decoupling and the corresponding analog for
internal model principle for quantum systems.

Aharonov-Bohm phase caused by the external flux. Using the numerical
renormalization group method, we find a splitting of the Kondo resonance at the
Fermi level which can be compensated by an external magnetic field. To fully
understand the nature of this compensation effect, we perform a scaling
analysis and derive an expression for the effective magnetic field. The
analysis is based on a tight-binding model which leads to an effective Anderson
model with a spin-dependent density of states for the transformed lead states.
We find that the effective field originates from the combined effect of Rashba
interaction and magnetic flux and that it contains important corrections due to
electron-electron interactions. We show that the compensating field is an
oscillatory function of both the spin-orbit and the Aharonov-Bohm phases.
Moreover, the effective field never vanishes due to the particle-hole symmetry
breaking independently of the gate voltage.

fails to address efficiency problems. Recent technological advances suggest
less metal-specific reliance, but plastic substrates are bound by
cost-inefficiency. Photovoltaic paint effectively dissociates from metal
dependency and relies on a combination p-n junction diode
principle/thermoelectric effect to generate electrical energy from solar
exposure. Replicating the junction is accomplished via multi-polymer layers of
crystalline-silica water-based paint with ionic solution concentration gradient
overlap, reconstructing the depletion zone and, in thermal respects, construes
the thermoelectric effect via replication of a heavily modified thermocouple.
Experimentation revealed the largest gradient (50%-10%) of ionic solution,
specifically, sodium-chloride solution, per paint solution liter generated the
largest electrical energy yield (Cf. control yielding none). Maintenance of a
functional electro-conductive gradient is achieved with specialized, non-acidic
solution, but the lifespan of the charge is virtually instantaneous. The
experimentation yielded possible exploits for multi-polymer conduction layer
advancement; however, the production of solar-receptive paints replicating the
capture and distribution scheme of solar panels, sans the inflexibility and
limited application. Prospective applications include electrical automobile
augmentation, solar-receptive buildings, and vast tracts of solar farms given
solid initial conditions. Weathering, life expectancy, and storage are
paint-specific. The intentions of sculpting the ideal alternative energy are in
efforts to propose novel mechanisms curbing fossil fuel dependence and arousing
intellectual curiosity and creativity on the many channels converging on
innovative environmental feats.

H2 rotational line emission from the Stephan's Quintet (SQ) X-ray emitting
large scale shock associated with a collision between two galaxies. Because H2
forms on dust grains, the presence of H2 is physically linked to the survival
of dust, and we expect some dust emission to come from the molecular gas. To
test this interpretation, IR observations and dust modeling are used to
identify and characterize the thermal dust emission from the shocked molecular
gas. The spatial distribution of the IR emission allows us to isolate the faint
PAH and dust continuum emission associated with the molecular gas in the SQ
shock. We model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of this emission, and
fit it to Spitzer observations. Faint PAH and dust continuum emission are
detected in the SQ shock, outside star-forming regions. The 12/24um flux ratio
in the shock is remarkably close to that of the diffuse Galactic interstellar
medium, leading to a Galactic PAH/VSG abundance ratio. However, the properties
of the PAH emission spectrum in the shock differ from that of the Galaxy, which
may suggest an enhanced fraction of large and neutrals PAHs. The IR SED is
consistent with the expected emission from dust associated with the warm
(>150K) H2 gas, heated by a UV radiation field of intensity comparable to that
of the solar neighborhood, in agreement with GALEX UV observations. The
presence of PAHs and dust grains in the high-speed (1000km/s) galaxy collision
suggests that dust survives. We propose that the dust that survived destruction
was in pre-shock gas at densites larger than a few 0.1cm-3, which was not
shocked at velocities larger than 200km/s. [abridged]

some insight into the origin and nature of ""bobbing"" motion and ""kicks"" that
occur in this system. Our basic tool is a general formalism for describing the
motion of extended test bodies in an external electromagnetic field in curved
spacetime and possibly subject to other forces. We first show that bobbing of
exactly the type as observed in numerical simulations of the binary black hole
system occurs in a simple system consisting of two spinning balls connected by
an elastic band in flat spacetime. This bobbing may be understood as arising
from the difference between a spinning body's ""lab frame centroid"" and its true
center of mass, and is purely ""kinematical"" in the sense that it will appear
regardless of the forces holding two spinning bodies in orbit. Next, we develop
precise rules for relating the motion of charged bodies in a stationary
external electromagnetic field in flat spacetime with the motion of bodies in a
weakly curved stationary spacetime. We then consider the system consisting of
two orbiting charges with magnetic dipole moment and spin at a level of
approximation corresponding to 1.5 post-Newtonian order. Here we find that
considerable amounts of momentum are exchanged between the bodies and the
electromagnetic field; however, the bodies store this momentum entirely as
""hidden"" mechanical momentum, so that the interchange does not give rise to any
net bobbing. The net bobbing that does occur is due solely to the kinematical
spin effect, and we therefore argue that the net bobbing of the electromagnetic
binary is not associated with possible kicks. We believe that this conclusion
holds in the gravitational case as well.

influence the level of liquidity. Therefore, two indicators are to be taken

estimated costs, and, the elasticity of immediate liquidity - fixed costs only
include costs that are payable. The coefficients of leverage of ongoing
liquidity and of leverage of immediate liquidity in relation to the operating
margin have a behaviour that is identical to that calculated in relation to

change in elasticity of the costs and of its influence on the unitary operating
margin is the sole parameter available to the entrepreneur to maintain the
liquidity of the company at the desired level. But, if the productive capacity
is variable, the entrepreneur can use the volume of sales to control liquidity

adjust the relevant elements to retain in the operating structure the degree of

invariance of Poisson brackets or quantum commutators under canonical
transformations, which I regard as a global symmetry. A gauge symmetry can be
defined in phase space (X,P) that imposes equivalence of momentum and position
for every motion at every instant of the worldline. One of the consequences of
this gauge symmetry is a new formulation of physics in spacetime. Instead of
one time there must be two, while phenomena described by one-time physics in
3+1 dimensions appear as various shadows of the same phenomena that occur in
4+2 dimensions with one extra space and one extra time dimensions (more
generally, d+2). The 2T-physics formulation leads to a unification of
1T-physics systems not suspected before and there are new correct predictions
from 2T-physics that 1T-physics is unable to make on its own systematically.
Additional data related to the predictions, that provides information about the
properties of the extra 1-space and extra 1-time dimensions, can be gathered by
observers stuck in 3+1 dimensions. This is the probe for investigating
indirectly the extra 1+1 dimensions which are neither small nor hidden. This 2T
formalism that originated in 1998 has been extended in recent years from the
worldline to field theory in d+2 dimensions. This includes 2T field theories
that yield 1T field theories for the Standard Model and General Relativity as
shadows of their counterparts in 4+2 dimensions. Problems of ghosts and
causality in a 2T space-time are resolved automatically by the gauge symmetry,
while a higher unification of 1T field theories is obtained. In this lecture
the approach will be described at an elementary worldline level, and the
current status of 2T-physics will be summarized.

from simulations of hydromagnetic flows is extended to the regime with a
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) background. Methods: A generalized set of test
equations is derived using both the induction equation and a modified momentum
equation. By employing an additional set of auxiliary equations, we derive
linear equations describing the response of the system to a set of prescribed
test fields. Purely magnetic and MHD backgrounds are emulated by applying an
electromotive force in the induction equation analogously to the ponderomotive
force in the momentum equation. Both forces are chosen to have Roberts
flow-like geometry. Results: Examples with an MHD background are studied where
the previously used quasi-kinematic test-field method breaks down. In cases
with homogeneous mean fields it is shown that the generalized test-field method
produces the same results as the imposed-field method, where the field-aligned
component of the actual electromotive force from the simulation is used.
Furthermore, results for the turbulent diffusivity tensor are given, which are
inaccessible to the imposed-field method. For MHD backgrounds, new mean-field
effects are found that depend on the occurrence of cross-correlations between
magnetic and velocity fluctuations. For strong imposed fields, $\alpha$ is
found to be quenched proportional to the fourth power of the field strength,

""GeV-Matter"" -- that are charged under this force and constitute a small
fraction of the dark matter halo. Dark higgsinos in a supersymmetric dark
sector are natural candidates for GeV-Matter that scatter off protons with a
universal cross-section of 5 x 10^{-38} cm^2 and can naturally be split by
10-30 keV so that their dominant interaction with protons is down-scattering.
As an example, down-scattering of an O(5) GeV dark higgsino can simultaneously
explain the spectra observed by both CoGeNT and DAMA. The event rates in these
experiments correspond to a GeV-Matter abundance of 0.2-1% of the halo mass
density. This abundance can arise directly from thermal freeze-out at weak
coupling, or from the late decay of an unstable TeV-scale WIMP. Our proposal
can be tested by searches for exotics in the BaBar and Belle datasets.

constraining cosmological parameters as well as cluster formation histories.
One of the key cosmological parameters, sigma8, is constrained using observed
clusters of galaxies, although current estimates of sigma8 from the scaling
relations of dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters are limited by the large
scatter in the observed cluster mass-temperature (M-T) relation. With a sample
of eight strong lensing clusters at 0.3 < z <0.8, we find that the observed
cluster concentration-mass relation can be used to reduce the M-T scatter by a
factor of 6. Typically only relaxed clusters are used to estimate sigma8, but
combining the cluster concentration-mass relation with the M-T relation enables
the inclusion of unrelaxed clusters as well. Thus, the resultant gains in the
accuracy of sigma8 measurements from clusters are twofold: the errors on sigma8
are reduced and the cluster sample size is increased. Therefore, the statistics
on sigma8 determination from clusters are greatly improved by the inclusion of
unrelaxed clusters. Exploring cluster scaling relations further, we find that
the correlation between brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) luminosity and cluster
mass offers insight into the assembly histories of clusters. We find
preliminary evidence for a steeper BCG luminosity - cluster mass relation for
strong lensing clusters than the general cluster population, hinting that
strong lensing clusters may have had more active merging histories.

Belt objects. At least 10% of solar type stars also bear gas giant planets. The
fraction of stars with known gas giants or detectable debris disks (or both)
appears to increase with the stellar mass. Here, we examine the dynamical
evolution of systems of long-period gas giant planets and residual
planetesimals as their host stars evolve off the main sequence, lose mass, and
form planetary nebula around remnant white dwarf cores. The orbits of distant
gas giant planets and super-km-size planetesimals expand adiabatically. During
the most intense AGB mass loss phase, sub-meter-size particles migrate toward
their host stars due to the strong hydrodynamical drag by the intense stellar
wind. Along their migration paths, gas giant planets capture and sweep up
sub-km-size planetesimals onto their mean-motion resonances. These
planetesimals also acquire modest eccentricities which are determined by the
mass of the perturbing planets, the rate and speed of stellar mass loss. The
swept-up planetesimals undergo disruptive collisions which lead to the
production of grains with an extended size range. The radiation drag on these
particles is ineffective against the planets' resonant barrier and they form
30-to-150-AU-sizes rings which can effective reprocess the stellar irradiation
in the form of FIR continuum. We identify the recently discovered dust ring

around the dark matter dominant NFW and Hernquist distributions, compared
against the Isothermal Sphere observed in galaxy scale objects. We show that
mass measurement in the core of the group (r ~ 0.2 r_{vir}), determined jointly
from a lens model and from differential velocity dispersion estimates, may
effectively distinguish between these density distributions. We apply our
method to MOS observations of two groups, SL2SJ1430+5546 and SL2SJ1431+5533,
drawn from our CFHTLS lens catalog. With the measured lensing and dynamical
masses, combined with a maximum likelihood estimator built around our model, we
estimate the concentration index characterizing each density distribution and
the corresponding virial mass of each group. Our results indicate that both
groups are dark matter dominant, and reject the Isothermal distribution at >>3
sigma level. For both groups, the estimated i-band M/L ratios of ~260
Msun/Lsun, are similar to other published values for groups. The Gaussian

measured in the NIR and radio bands are closer to the intrinsic fractions of
the populations, and that the optical fractions are significantly biased due to
obscuration effects, similar to high-ionization broad absorption line quasars

for high fractions of LoBALs at high NIR luminosities, especially for FeLoBALs
with a fraction of ~18 per cent at M_K_s < -31 mag. This population of NIR
luminous LoBALs may be at an early evolutionary stage of quasar evolution. We
use a two-component model of LoBALs including a pure geometric component and a
luminosity dependent component at high NIR luminosities, and obtain better fits
than those from a pure geometric model. Therefore, the LoBAL population can be
modelled as a hybrid of both the geometric and evolutionary models, where the
geometric component constitutes 3.4\pm0.3, 5.8\pm0.4, and 1.5\pm0.3 per cent of
the quasar population for BI-LoBALs, AI-LoBALs, and FeLoBALs, respectively.

from other bands by breaking time reversal symmetry, allowing for an extensive
degeneracy when these bands are partially filled; (b) An isolated flat band
corresponds to a critical point between regimes where the band is electron-like
or hole-like, with an anomalous Hall conductance that changes sign across the
transition; (c) When the gap between a flat band and two neighboring bands
closes, the system is described by a single spin-1 conical-like spectrum,
extending to higher angular momentum the spin-1/2 Dirac-like spectra in
topological insulators and graphene; and (d) some configurations of parameters
admit two isolated parallel flat bands, raising the possibility of exotic
""heavy excitons""; (e) We find that the Chern number of the flat bands, in all

revealing degeneracies in the parameter space we can hope to better understand
the key physical processes probed by the data. We use novel mathematical
techniques to explore the parameter space of the GALFORM semi-analytic model.
We base our investigation on the Bower et al. 2006 version of GALFORM, adopting
the same methodology of selecting model parameters based on an acceptable match
to the local bJ and K luminosity functions. The model contains 16 parameters
that are poorly constrained, and we investigate this parameter space using the
Model Emulator technique, constructing a Bayesian approximation to the GALFORM
model that can be rapidly evaluated at any point in parameter space. By
combining successive waves of emulation, we show that only 0.26% of the initial
volume is of interest for further exploration. However, within this region we
show that the Bower et al. 2006 model is only one choice from an extended
sub-space of model parameters that can provide equally acceptable fits. We
explore the geometry of this region and begin to explore the physical
connections between parameters that are exposed by this analysis. We also
consider the impact of adding additional observational data to further
constrain the parameter space.

\emph{fringe shift} of the interference pattern. Regularly, the fringe shift
calculations are only presented from the perspective of the inertial frame
where the one-way speed of light is anisotropic which gives a partial vision of
the problem. In a spirit of revision of these facts we have meticulously
analyzed the physics behind them. As a result, an angular effect which is based
on Huyghens principle and plays a fundamental role in the reflection of light
waves at moving mirrors is incorporated. Moreover, under the assumption of a
null result in the experiment, on the one hand, the fringe shift conditions
demand actual relativistic effects; on the other, it is confirmed that
Maxwell's electrodynamics and Galilean relativity are incompatible
formulations. From these two points at least three inertial theories follow:
(1) the special theory of relativity (SR), (2) a new aether theory (NET) based
on the Tangherlini transformations and (3) emission theories based on Ritz'
modification of electrodynamics. A brief review of their physical content is
presented and the problem of the aether detection as well as the propagation of
light, within the context of SR and the NET, are discussed. Despite the
overwhelming amount of evidences that apparently favors SR we claim that there
are no strong reasons to refuse the aether which conceived as a continuous
material medium, still stands up as a physical reality and could be physically
associated with dark matter, the cosmic background radiation and the vacuum
condensates of particle physics.

Linear acceleration emission occurs when a charged particle is
accelerated parallel to its velocity. We evaluate the spectral and angular
distribution of this radiation for several special cases, including constant
acceleration (hyperbolic motion) of finite duration. Based on these results, we
find the following general properties of the emission from an electron in a
linear accelerator that can be characterized by an electric field E acting over
a distance L: (i) the spectrum extends to a cut-off photon energy ~ LE^2 MeV,
where E is in units of the Schwinger critical field and L in units of the
Compton wavelength of the electron. (ii) the total energy emitted by a particle
traversing the accelerator is in agreement with the standard Larmor formula
(iii) the low frequency spectrum is flat for hyperbolic trajectories, but in
general depends on the details of the accelerator. We also show that linear
acceleration emission complements curvature radiation in the strongly
magnetized pair formation regions in pulsar magnetospheres. It dominates when
the length L of the accelerator is less than the formation length of curvature
photons, which is given by the ratio of the radius of curvature of the magnetic
field lines to the Lorentz factor of the particle. In standard static models of
pair creating regions linear acceleration emission is negligible, but it is
important in more realistic dynamical models in which the accelerating field
fluctuates on a short length-scale.

identify equilibrium solutions. These results are later analyzed in more detail
using a semi-analytical model. Apart from the well known quasi-satellite (QS)
orbits and the classical equilibrium Lagrangian points L4 and L5, we also find
a new regime of asymmetric periodic solutions. For low eccentricities these are
located at $(\sigma,\Delta\omega) = (\pm 60\deg, \mp 120\deg)$, where \sigma is
the difference in mean longitudes and \Delta\omega is the difference in
longitudes of pericenter. The position of these Anti-Lagrangian solutions
changes with the mass ratio and the orbital eccentricities, and are found for
eccentricities as high as ~ 0.7. Finally, we also applied a slow mass variation

service provision, are becoming ever-larger as the operators of those data
centres seek to maximise the benefits from economies of scale. With these
increases in size comes a growth in system complexity, which is usually
problematic. There is an increased desire for automated ""self-star""
configuration, management, and failure-recovery of the data-centre
infrastructure, but many traditional techniques scale much worse than linearly
as the number of nodes to be managed increases. As the number of nodes in a
median-sized data-centre looks set to increase by two or three orders of
magnitude in coming decades, it seems reasonable to attempt to explore and
understand the scaling properties of the data-centre middleware before such
data-centres are constructed. In [1] we presented SPECI, a simulator that
predicts aspects of large-scale data-centre middleware performance,
concentrating on the influence of status changes such as policy updates or
routine node failures. [...]. In [1] we used a first-approximation assumption
that such subscriptions are distributed wholly at random across the data
centre. In this present paper, we explore the effects of introducing more
realistic constraints to the structure of the internal network of
subscriptions. We contrast the original results [...] exploring the effects of
making the data-centre's subscription network have a regular lattice-like
structure, and also semi-random network structures resulting from parameterised
network generation functions that create ""small-world"" and ""scale-free""
networks. We show that for distributed middleware topologies, the structure and
distribution of tasks carried out in the data centre can significantly
influence the performance overhead imposed by the middleware.

of these cases the ground state energy shows any non-analyticity as a function

the fundamental changes in the internal correlations of the ground state wave

extended to fermionic particles in the several subtle aspects of the first and
second quantization theories. In this scenario, the use of the Dirac equation
is required for a satisfactory evolution of fermionic mass-eigenstates since in
the standard treatment of oscillations the mass-eigenstates are implicitly
assumed to be scalars and, consequently, the spinorial form of neutrino wave
functions is not included in the calculations. Within first quantized theories,
besides flavor oscillations, chiral oscillations automatically appear when we
set the dynamic equations for a fermionic Dirac-type particle. The left-handed
chiral nature of created and detected neutrinos can be implemented in the first
quantized Dirac theory in presence of mixing; the probability loss due to the
changing of initially left-handed neutrinos to the undetected right-handed
neutrinos can be obtained in analytic form. In the context of a causal
relativistic theory of a free particle, one of the two effects should be
present in flavor oscillations: (a) rapid oscillations or (b) initial flavor
violation. Concerning second quantized approaches, a simple second quantized
treatment exhibits a tiny but inevitable initial flavor violation without the
possibility of rapid oscillations. Such effect is a consequence of an
intrinsically indefinite but approximately well defined neutrino flavor. The
violation effects are shown to be much larger than loop induced lepton flavor
violation processes, already present in the standard model in the presence of
massive neutrinos with mixing. The conclusions of this report lead to lessons
concerning flavor mixing, chiral oscillations, interference between positive
and negative frequency components of Dirac equation solutions, and the field
formulation of quantum oscillations.

realistic simulations of the expected observations. The complex interplay of
various noise sources in the course of the observations made such simulations
an indispensable part of the assessment study of the PLATO Payload Consortium.
We created an end-to-end CCD simulation software-tool, dubbed PLATOSim, which
simulates photometric time-series of CCD images by including realistic models
of the CCD and its electronics, the telescope optics, the stellar field, the
pointing uncertainty of the satellite (or Attitude Control System [ACS]

addressed with this simulator were the noise properties of different
photometric algorithms, the selection of the optical design, the allowable
jitter amplitude, and the expected noise budget of light-curves as a function
of the stellar magnitude for different parameter conditions. The results of our
simulations showed that the proposed multi-telescope concept of PLATO can
fulfil the defined scientific goal of measuring more than 20000 cool dwarfs

given specification. Under a probabilistic assumption about the possible

which assigns to each word a value, such that a system is preferred if it

problem: given an omega-regular specification, a Markov chain that describes
the distribution of inputs, and a weighted automaton that measures how well a
system satisfies the given specification under the given input assumption,
synthesize a system that optimizes the measured value.
  For safety specifications and measures given by mean-payoff automata, the
optimal-synthesis problem amounts to finding a strategy in a Markov decision
process (MDP) that is optimal for a long-run average reward objective, which
can be done in polynomial time. For general omega-regular specifications, the
solution rests on a new, polynomial-time algorithm for computing optimal
strategies in MDPs with mean-payoff parity objectives.
  Our algorithm generates optimal strategies consisting of two memoryless
strategies and a counter. This counter is in general not bounded. To obtain a
finite-state system, we show how to construct an \epsilon-optimal strategy with
a bounded counter for any \epsilon>0. We also show how to decide in polynomial
time if we can construct an optimal finite-state system (i.e., a system without
a counter) for a given specification.
  We have implemented our approach in a tool that takes qualitative and
quantitative specifications and automatically constructs a system that
satisfies the qualitative specification and optimizes the quantitative
specification, if such a system exists. We present experimental results showing
optimal systems that were generated in this way.

Two further approximations are introduced and each can be used to truncate and
solve the hierarchy. In the first approximation such a truncation is performed
by replacing two-particle Green's functions (GFs) in the hierarchy by their
values at equilibrium. The second method is developed based on the cluster
expansion, which constructs two-particle GFs from one-particle GFs and neglects
the correlation part. A non-equilibrium Wick's Theorem is proved to provide a
basis for this non-equilibrium cluster expansion. Using those two
approximations, our method of solving the Redfield equation, for instance, of
an N-site chain of interacting spinless fermions, involves an eigenvalue
problem with dimension $2^{N}$ and a linear system with dimension $N^2$ in the
first case, and a nonlinear equation with dimension $N^2$ in the second case,
which can be solved iteratively via a sequence of $N^2$ linear systems. Other
currently available direct methods correspond to a linear system or an
eigenvalue system with dimension $4^N$ plus an eigenvalue system with dimension
$2^N$. As a test of the methods, for small systems with size N=4, results are
found to be consistent with results made available by other direct methods.
Although not discussed here, extending both methods to their next levels is
straightforward. This indicates a promising potential for this BBGKY-like
approach of non-equilibrium kinetic equations.

This novel approach
is based on the fact that Einstein gravity can be formulated in terms of a
symplectic geometry rather than a Riemannian geometry in the context of
emergent gravity. An essential step for emergent gravity is to realize the
equivalence principle, the most important property in the theory of gravity
(general relativity), from U(1) gauge theory on a symplectic or Poisson
manifold. Through the realization of the equivalence principle, which is an
intrinsic property in symplectic geometry known as the Darboux theorem or the
Moser lemma, one can understand how diffeomorphism symmetry arises from
noncommutative U(1) gauge theory; thus, gravity can emerge from the
noncommutative electromagnetism, which is also an interacting theory. As a
consequence, a background-independent quantum gravity in which the prior
existence of any spacetime structure is not a priori assumed but is defined by
using the fundamental ingredients in quantum gravity theory can be formulated.
This scheme for quantum gravity can be used to resolve many notorious problems
in theoretical physics, such as the cosmological constant problem, to
understand the nature of dark energy, and to explain why gravity is so weak
compared to other forces. In particular, it leads to a remarkable picture of
what matter is. A matter field, such as leptons and quarks, simply arises as a
stable localized geometry, which is a topological object in the defining
algebra (noncommutative $\star$-algebra) of quantum gravity.

hierarchies in the form of $u_{n,t}=L^m H^{(0)}$, where $m$ is an arbitrary
integer (instead of a nature number) and $L$ is the recursion operator. Then by
means of the zero-curvature representations of the isospectral and
non-isospectral flows, we construct symmetries for the isospectral equation
hierarchy as well as non-isospectral equation hierarchy, respectively. The
symmetries, respectively, form two centerless Kac-Moody-Virasoro algebras. The
recursion operator $L$ is proved to be hereditary and a strong symmetry for
this isospectral equation hierarchy. Besides, we make clear for the relation
between four-potential and two-potential Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchies. The even
order members in the four-potential Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchies together with
their symmetries and algebraic structures can be reduced to two-potential case.
The reduction keeps invariant for the algebraic structures and the recursion

successfully constructed a model of inflation that produces the spectral index,
the running of the spectral index and the amplitude of scalar perturbations
within the constraints given by the WMAP 7 years data. The model simultaneously
describes the Big Bang and inflation connected by a specific time delay between
them so that these two events are regarded as dependent on each other. In
solving the Fridemann equations, we have utilized an essential Weyl symmetry of
our theory in 3+1 dimensions which is a predicted remaining symmetry of
2T-physics field theory in 4+2 dimensions. This led to a new method of
obtaining analytic solutions in 1T field theory which could in principle be
used to solve more complicated theories with more scalar fields. Some
additional distinguishing properties of the solution includes the fact that
there are early periods of time when the slow roll approximation is not valid.
Furthermore, the inflaton does not decrease monotonically with time, rather it
oscillates around the potential minimum while settling down, unlike the slow
roll approximation. While the model we used for illustration purposes is
realistic in most respects, it lacks a mechanism for stopping inflation. The
technique of obtaining analytic solutions opens a new window for studying
inflation, and other applications, more precisely than using approximations.

expands the averaging so as to include the covariance information within those

of 2DPCA, r = n that of PCA. Hence, by controlling r it is possible to control
the trade-offs between recognition accuracy and energy compression (fewer

addressing the complex requirements of todays embedded applications. This
demand has sparked the interest in symbolic control where lower complexity
models of control systems are used to cater for complex specifications given by
temporal logics, regular languages, or automata. These specification mechanisms
can be regarded as qualitative since they divide the trajectories of the plant
into bad trajectories (those that need to be avoided) and good trajectories.
However, many applications require also the optimization of quantitative
measures of the trajectories retained by the controller, as specified by a cost
or utility function. As a first step towards the synthesis of controllers
reconciling both qualitative and quantitative specifications, we investigate in
this paper the use of symbolic models for time-optimal controller synthesis. We
consider systems related by approximate (alternating) simulation relations and
show how such relations enable the transfer of time-optimality information

time-optimal controllers for a control system by working with a lower
complexity symbolic model. The resulting approximately time-optimal controllers
are equipped with upper and lower bounds for the time to reach a target,

reduces the delay, the packet loss and the registration time for all the
packets transferred between the cn and the mn. In this technique, tunneling
occurs at two levels above the ha in a hierarchical network. To show the
effectiveness of the proposed technique, it is compared with the original mip

our proposed technique achieves better performance than the others, considering

enforcement of security properties in an open peer-topeer network remains an
open problem as the literature have mainly proposed contribution on
availability of resources and anonymity of users. That paper proposes a novel
architecture that eases the administration of a peer-to-peer network. It
considers a network of safe peer-to-peer clients in the sense that it is a
commune client software that is shared by all the participants to cope with the
sharing of various resources associated with different security requirements.
However, our proposal deals with possible malicious peers that attempt to
compromise the requested security properties. Despite the safety of an open
peer-to-peer network cannot be formally guaranteed, since a end user has
privileges on the target host, our solution provides several advanced security
enforcement. First, it enables to formally define the requested security
properties of the various shared resources. Second, it evaluates the trust and
the reputation of the requesting peer by sending challenges that test the
fairness of its peer-to-peer security policy. Moreover, it proposes an advanced
Mandatory Access Control that enforces the required peer-to-peer security
properties through an automatic projection of the requested properties onto
SELinux policies. Thus, the SELinux system of the requesting peer is
automatically configured with respect to the required peer-to-peer security
properties.

cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, given by the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi metric.
These configurations provide a simple but useful generalization of the
Lambda-CDM model describing cold dark matter (CDM) and a Lambda term, which
seems to fit current cosmological observations. The dynamics of these models
can be fully described by scalar evolution equations that can be given in the
form of a proper dynamical system associated with a 4-dimensional phase space
whose critical points and invariant subspaces are examined and classified. The
phase space evolution of various configurations is studied in detail by means
of two 2-dimensional subspaces: a projection into the invariant homogeneous
subspace associated with Lambda-CDM solutions with FLRW metric, and a
projection into a subspace generated by suitably defined fluctuations that
convey the effects of inhomogeneity. We look at cases with perpetual expansion,
bouncing and loitering behavior, as well as configurations with ""mixed""
kinematic patters, such as a collapsing region in an expanding background. In
all cases, phase space trajectories emerge from and converge to stable past and
future attractors in a qualitatively analogous way as in the case of the FLRW
limit. However, we can identify in both projections of the phase space various
qualitative features absent in the FLRW limit that can be useful in the
construction of toy models of astrophysical and cosmological inhomogeneities.

exquisitely sensitive force detectors, with a measured sensitivity more than
three orders of magnitude better than existing reports. We demonstrate
detection of forces as small as 174 $yN$ (yocto $=10^{-24}$), with a
sensitivity 390$\pm150$ $yN/\sqrt{Hz}$ using crystals of $n=60$ $^{9}$Be$^{+}$

motional modes in an ion trap by externally applied electric fields, detection
via and phase-coherent Doppler velocimetry, which allows for the discrimination
of ion motion with amplitudes on the scale of nanometers. These experimental
results and extracted force-detection sensitivities in the single-ion limit
validate proposals suggesting that trapped atomic ions are capable of detecting
of forces with sensitivity approaching 1 $yN/\sqrt{Hz}$. We anticipate that
this demonstration will be strongly motivational for the development of a new
class of deployable trapped-ion-based sensors, and will permit scientists to

appear to be young and less massive,a noticeable fraction of LAEs possess much
older populations of stars and larger stellar mass.How these two classes of
LAEs are concordant with the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario has not
been understood clearly so far.In this paper,we model LAEs by three-dimensional
cosmological simulations of dark halo merger in a CDM universe.As a result,it
is shown that the age of simulated LAEs can spread over a wide range from
2*10^6yr to 9*10^8yr.Also,we find that there are two types of LAEs, in one of
which the young half-mass age is comparable to the mean age of stellar
component,and in the other of which the young half-mass age is appreciably
shorter than the mean age.We define the former as Type 1 LAEs and the latter as
Type 2 LAEs.A Type 1 corresponds to early starburst in a young galaxy,whereas a
Type 2 does to delayed starburst in an evolved galaxy,as a consequence of
delayed accretion of a subhalo onto a larger parent halo.Thus,the same halo can
experience a Type 2 LAE-phase as well as a Type 1 LAE-phase in the merger
history.Type 1s are expected to be younger than 1.5*10^8yr,less dusty,and less
massive with stellar mass M*<10^8 Msun,while Type 2s are older than
1.5*10^8yr,even dustier,and as massive as M*~10^8-10^10Msun.The fraction of
Type 2s in all LAEs is a function of redshift.Type 2s discriminated clearly
from Type 1s in two color diagram of z'-H vs J-K.We find that the brightness
distribution of LyA in Type 2s is more extended than the main stellar
component,in contrast to Type 1s.This is not only because delayed starbursts
tend to occur in the outskirts of a parent galaxy,but also because LyA photons
are effectively absorbed by dust in an evolved galaxy.Hence,the extent of LyA
emission may be an additional measure to distinguish Type 2s from Type 1s

where mu = m_e/m_p is the electron-to-proton mass ratio, and alpha is the
fine-structure constant. The fundamental physical constants, which are measured
in different physical environments of high (terrestrial) and low (interstellar)
densities of baryonic matter are supposed to vary in chameleon-like scalar
field models, which predict that both masses and coupling constant may depend
on the local matter density. The parameter Delta F/F = (F_obs - F_lab)/F_lab
can be estimated from the radial velocity offset, Delta V = V_rot-V_fs, between
the low-laying rotational transitions in carbon monoxide 13CO and the
fine-structure transitions in atomic carbon [CI]. A model-dependent constraint
on Delta alpha/alpha can be obtained from Delta F/F using Delta mu/mu
independently measured from the ammonia method. Currently available radio
astronomical datasets provide an upper limit on |Delta V| < 110 m/s (1sigma).
When interpreted in terms of the spatial variation of F, this gives |Delta F/F|
< 3.7*10^-{7}. An order of magnitude improvement of this limit will allow us to
test independently a non-zero value of Delta mu/mu = (2.2 +/- 0.4_stat +/-
0.3_sys)*10^{-8} recently found with the ammonia method. Taking into account
that the ammonia method restricts the spatial variation of mu at the level of
|Delta mu/mu| <= 3*10^{-8} and assuming that Delta F/F is the same in the
entire interstellar medium, one obtains that the spatial variation of alpha
does not exceed the value |Delta alpha/alpha| < 2*10^{-7}. Since extragalactic
gas clouds have densities similar to those in the interstellar medium, the
bound on Delta alpha/alpha is also expected to be less than 2*10^{-7} at high
redshift if no significant temporal dependence of alpha is present.

context, two dispersion criteria are usually considered: the minimax and the
maximin ones. In the case of a hypercube domain, a standard strategy consists
of taking the maximin design within the class of Latin hypercube designs.
However, in a non hypercube context, it does not make sense to use the Latin
hypercube strategy. Moreover, whatever the design is, the black-box function is
typically approximated thanks to kernel interpolation. Here, we first provide a
theoretical justification to the maximin criterion with respect to kernel
interpolations. Then, we propose simulated annealing algorithms to determine

storage capacity and improving the reliability through distributing data over
multiple storage nodes. On the other hand, it may happen the data is stored in
unreliable nodes, while it is desired the end user to have a reliable access to
the stored data. So, in an event that a node is damaged, to prevent the system
reliability to regress, it is necessary to regenerate a new node with the same
amount of stored data as the damaged node to retain the number of storage
nodes, thereby having the previous reliability. This requires the new node to
connect to some of existing nodes and downloads the required information,
thereby occupying some bandwidth, called the repair bandwidth. On the other
hand, it is more likely the cost of downloading varies across different nodes.
This paper aims at investigating the theoretical cost-bandwidth tradeoff, and
more importantly, it is demonstrated that any point on this curve can be
achieved through the use of the so called generalized regenerating codes which
is an enhancement of the regeneration codes introduced by Dimakis et al. in

is easily lifted by any symmetry breaking perturbation, allows for a strong
inhomogeneous broadening of the boron-related electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) lines, e.g. by a random distribution of local strains. However, since EPR
of boron acceptors in externally unstrained silicon was reported for the first
time, neither the line shape nor the magnitude of the residual broadening
observed in samples with high crystalline purity were compatible with the low
concentrations of carbon and oxygen point defects, being the predominant source
of random local strain. Adapting a theoretical model which has been applied to
understand the acceptor ground state splitting in the absence of a magnetic
field as an effect due to the presence of different silicon isotopes, we show
that local fluctuations of the valence band edge due to different isotopic
configurations in the vicinity of the boron acceptors can quantitatively
account for all inhomogeneous broadening effects in high purity Si with a
natural isotope composition. Our calculations show that such an isotopic
perturbation also leads to a shift in the g-value of different boron-related
resonances, which we could verify in our experiments. Further, our results
provide an independent test and verification of the valence band offsets
between the different Si isotopes determined in previous works.

uncovered with spectroscopy. This new data set allows the parameters of this
singular planetary system to be significantly refined. We obtained a
planet-to-star radius ratio R_p/R_* = 0.1001 +/- 0.0006 that is slightly lower
than the one measured from previous ground observations. We detected a feature
in the Spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot. We also found a
transit timing about 20 minutes earlier than the ephemeris prediction; this
could be caused by actual TTVs due to an additional body in the system or by
underestimated systematic uncertainties. The sky-projected angle between the
spin-axis of HD80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found to
be lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the Rossiter-McLaughlin
anomaly. This allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be definitively
rejected. Over the twenty planetary systems with measured spin-orbit angles, a
few of them are misaligned; this is probably the signature of two different
evolution scenarios for misaligned and aligned systems, depending if they
experienced or not gravitational interaction with a third body. As in the case
of HD80606b, most of the planetary systems including a massive planet are
tilted; this could be the signature of a separate evolution scenario for
massive planets in comparison with Jupiter-mass planets.

FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ and a transition temperature of $T_{c}\simeq14.6$ K were
synthesized by the Bridgman method. The structural and anisotropic
superconducting properties of those crystals were investigated by means of
single crystal X-ray and neutron powder diffraction, SQUID and torque
magnetometry, and muon-spin rotation. Room temperature neutron powder
diffraction reveals that 95% of the crystal volume is of the same tetragonal
structure as PbO. The structure refinement yields a stoichiometry of
Fe_1.045Se_0.406Te_0.594. Additionally, a minor hexagonal Fe_7Se_8 impurity
phase was identified. The magnetic penetration depth \lambda at zero
temperature was found to be 491(8) nm in the ab-plane and 1320(14) nm along the
c-axis. The zero-temperature value of the superfluid density \rho_s(0)
\lambda^-2(0) obeys the empirical Uemura relation observed for various
unconventional superconductors, including cuprates and iron-pnictides. The
temperature dependences of both \lambda_ab and \lambda_c are well described by
a two-gap s+s-wave model with the zero-temperature gap values of
\Delta_S(0)=0.51(3) meV and \Delta_L(0)=2.61(9) meV for the small and the large
gap, respectively. The magnetic penetration depth anisotropy parameter
\gamma_\lambda(T)=\lambda_c(T)/\lambda_{ab}(T) increases with decreasing
temperature, in agreement with \gamma_\lambda(T) observed in the iron-pnictide

of the solar neighbourhood. The IGIMF (Weidner & Kroupa 2005) is computed from
the combination of the stellar intial mass function (IMF), i.e. the mass
function of single star clusters, and the embedded cluster mass function, i.e.
a power law with index beta. By taking into account also the fact that the
maximum achievable stellar mass is a function of the total mass of the cluster,
the IGIMF becomes a time-varying IMF which depends on the star formation rate.
We applied this formalism to a chemical evolution model for the solar
neighbourhood and compared the results obtained by assuming three possible
values for beta with the results obtained by means of a standard, well-tested,
constant IMF. In general, a lower absolute value of beta implies a flatter
IGIMF, hence a larger number of massive stars and larger metal ejection rates.
This translates into higher type Ia and II supernova rates, higher mass
ejection rates from massive stars and a larger amount of gas available for star
formation, coupled with lower present-day stellar mass densities. (abridged) We
also discuss the importance of the present day stellar mass function (PDMF) in
providing a way to disentangle among various assumptions for beta. Our results
indicate that the model adopting the IGIMF computed with beta ~2 should be
considered the best since it allows us to reproduce the observed PDMF and to
account for most of the chemical evolution constraints considered in this work.

exoplanets WASP-1b and WASP-2b using the Spitzer Space Telescope. The two
planets have very similar masses but suffer different levels of irradiation and
are predicted to fall either side of a sharp transition between planets with
and without hot stratospheres. WASP-1b is one of the most highly irradiated
planets studied to date. We measure planet/star contrast ratios in all four of
the IRAC bands for both planets (3.6-8.0um), and our results indicate the
presence of a strong temperature inversion in the atmosphere of WASP-1b,
particularly apparent at 8um, and no inversion in WASP-2b. In both cases the
measured eclipse depths favor models in which incident energy is not
redistributed efficiently from the day side to the night side of the planet. We
fit the Spitzer light curves simultaneously with the best available radial
velocity curves and transit photometry in order to provide updated measurements
of system parameters. We do not find significant eccentricity in the orbit of
either planet, suggesting that the inflated radius of WASP-1b is unlikely to be
the result of tidal heating. Finally, by plotting ratios of secondary eclipse
depths at 8um and 4.5um against irradiation for all available planets, we find
evidence for a sharp transition in the emission spectra of hot Jupiters at an
irradiation level of 2 x 10^9 erg/s/cm^2. We suggest this transition may be due
to the presence of TiO in the upper atmospheres of the most strongly irradiated
hot Jupiters.

to the transition form factor of the pion. First, we argue that variants of the

unitarity bounds, as these bounds are based on unverified assumptions for the
real parts of the amplitudes, precluding a possible presence of polynomial
terms. A direct consequence is that the transition form factor need not
necessarily vanish at large values of the photon virtuality. Moreover, in the
range of the BaBar experiment, the Terazawa-West bound is an order of magnitude
above the data, thus is of formal rather than practical interest. Then we
demonstrate how the experimental data may be properly explained with incomplete
vector-meson dominance in a simple model with one state, as well as in more
sophisticated Regge models. Generalizations of the simple Regge model along the
lines of Dominguez result in a proper description of the data, where one may
adjust the parameters in such a way that the Terazawa-West bound is satisfied

of single helium stars with initial masses of 2.8 - 20 Msun. We find that,
despite the impact of tidal interaction on the rotation of primary stars, the
amount of angular momentum retained in the core at the presupernova stage in
different binary model sequences converge to a value similar to those found in
previous single star models. This amount is large enough to produce millisecond
pulsars, but too small to produce magnetars or long gamma-ray bursts. We employ
the most up-to-date estimate for the Wolf-Rayet mass loss rate, and its
implications for SN Ib/c progenitors are discussed in detail. In terms of
stellar structure, SN Ib/c progenitors in binary systems are predicted to have
a wide range of final masses even up to 7 Msun, with helium envelopes of 0.16 -
1.5 Msun. Our results indicate that, if the lack of helium lines in the spectra
of SNe Ic were due to small amounts of helium, the distribution of both initial
and final masses of SN Ic progenitors should be bimodal. Furthermore, we find
that a thin hydrogen layer (0.001 - 0.01 Msun) is expected to be present in
many SN Ib progenitors at the presupernova stage. We show that the presence of
hydrogen, together with a rather thick helium envelope, can lead to a
significant expansion of some SN Ib/c progenitors by the time of supernova
explosion. This may have important consequences for the shock break-out and
supernova light curve. We also argue that some SN progenitors with thin

conclude our investigation with a search for emission in the energy range above
100 MeV with the maximum likelihood technique. In the hard X-ray band the flux
of Cyg X-1 shows its typical erratic fluctuations at all timescales with
variations of about a factor of two that do not affect significantly the shape
of the energy spectrum. From the first order structure function we find that
the X-ray emission of Cyg X-1 is characterized by \textit{antipersistence},

to the Wigner semicircle law and this holds even down to the smallest possible

results hold even without the condition that the matrix elements are
identically distributed, only independence is used. In fact, we give strong
estimates on the matrix elements of the Green function as well that imply that
the local statistics of any two ensembles in the bulk are identical if the

abundance is the effective temperature. In a previous study by the authors, new
effective temperatures Teff for sixteen metal-poor halo dwarfs were derived
using a local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) description of the formation of
Fe lines. This new Teff scale reinforced the discrepancy. For six of the stars
from our previous study we calculate revised temperatures using a non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) approach. These are then used to derive a new
mean primordial lithium abundance in an attempt to solve the lithium
discrepancy. Using the code MULTI we calculate NLTE corrections to the LTE
abundances for the Fe I lines measured in the six stars, and determine new
Teff's. We keep other physical parameters, i.e. log g, [Fe/H] and xi, constant
at the values calculated in Paper I. With the revised Teff scale we derive new
Li abundances. We compare the NLTE values of Teff with the photometric
temperatures of Ryan et al. (1999, ApJ, 523, 654), the infrared flux method
(IRFM) temperatures of Melendez & Ramirez (2004, ApJ, 615, 33), and the Balmer
line wing temperatures of Asplund et al. (2006, ApJ, 644, 229). We find that
our temperatures are hotter than both the Ryan et al. and Asplund et al.
temperatures by typically ~ 110 K - 160 K, but are still cooler than the

a primordial Li abundance of 2.19 dex or 2.21 dex, depending on the magnitude
of collisions with hydrogen in the calculations, still well below the value of
2.72 dex inferred from WMAP + BBN. We discuss the effects of collisions on

the determination of log g through ionization equilibrium, which imply a
collisional scaling factor SH > 1 for collisions between Fe and H atoms.

nonlocal variables and poses the fundamental question of whether it is
physically meaningful to speak about the value of nonlocal variables at a
particular time. Recent work has shown that by weakening the role of the
measurement in preparing eigenstates of the variable it is in fact possible to
measure all nonlocal observables instantaneously by exploiting entanglement.
However, for these measurement schemes to succeed with certainty an infinite
amount of entanglement must be distributed initially and all this entanglement
is necessarily consumed. In this work we sharpen the characterisation of
instantaneous nonlocal measurements by explicitly devising schemes in which
only a finite amount of the initially distributed entanglement is ever
utilised. This enables us to determine an upper bound to the average
consumption for the most general cases of nonlocal measurements. This includes
the tasks of state verification, where the measurement verifies if the system
is in a given state, and verification measurements of a general set of
eigenstates of an observable. Despite its finiteness the growth of entanglement
consumption is found to display an extremely unfavourable exponential of an
exponential scaling with either the number of qubits needed to contain the
Schmidt rank of the target state or total number of qubits in the system for an
operator measurement. This scaling is seen to be a consequence of the
combination of the generic exponential scaling of unitary decompositions
combined with the highly recursive structure of our scheme required to overcome
the no-signalling constraint of relativistic causality.

objects with the submm dust cores, and the evolutionary stages of the
individual sources. Submm dust continuum emission was detected in 26 out of the

normal surfaces. In the case of 2-neighborly 3-manifolds and quadrangulated
slicings, a lower bound on the number of quadrilaterals of normal surfaces
depending on the genus g is presented. It is shown to be sharp for infinitely
many values of g. Furthermore we classify slicings of combinatorial 3-manifolds
with a maximum number of edges in the slicing.

resonance production and decay into a top quark pair at the LHC, where the
resonance could be either a Randall-Sundrum (RS) Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton $G$
or an extra gauge boson $Z'$. The complete NLO QCD corrections can enhance the
total cross sections by about $80\%- 100\%$ and $20\%- 40\%$ for the $G$ and
the $Z'$, respectively, depending on the resonance mass. We also explore in
detail the NLO corrections to the polar angle distributions of the top quark,
and our results show that the shapes of the NLO distributions can be different
from the leading order (LO) ones for the KK graviton. Moreover, we study the
NLO corrections to the spin correlations of the top quark pair production via
the above process, and find that the corrections are small.

bounded domain (sphere) before it escapes through a small window in the
domain's boundary. A particle is assumed to diffuse freely in the bulk until it
approaches the surface of the domain where it becomes weakly adsorbed, and then
wanders diffusively along the boundary for a random time until it desorbs back
to the bulk, and etc. Using a mean-field approximation, we define t_{app}
analytically as a function of the bulk and surface diffusion coefficients, the
mean time it spends in the bulk between two consecutive arrivals to the surface
and the mean time it wanders on the surface within a single round of the
surface diffusion.

hyperkahler and quaternionic Kahler geometries. On one hand, the target spaces
for rigid supersymmetric sigma-models are necessarily hyperkahler manifolds. On
the other hand, when coupled to N = 2 supergravity, the sigma-model target
spaces must be quaternionic Kahler. It is known that such manifolds of
restricted holonomy are difficult to generate explicitly. Projective superspace
is a field-theoretic approach to constructing general N = 2 supersymmetric
nonlinear sigma-models, and hence to generate new hyperkahler and quaternionic
Kahler metrics. Intended for a mixed audience consisting of both physicists and
mathematicians, these lectures provide a pedagogical introduction to the

to problems in such fields as distributed sensing and parallel processing.
Grassmannian fusion frames combine elements from both theories. A simple, novel
