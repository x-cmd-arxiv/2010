We find that the largest ISOC between $\pi$ electrons origins from the
following hopping processes: a $\pi$ electron hops to $\sigma$ orbits of the
other layer and further to $\pi$ orbits with the opposite spin through the
intra-atomic ISOC. The magnitude of this ISOC is about $0.46meV$, 100 times
larger than that of the monolayer graphene. The Hamiltonians including this
ISOC in both momentum and real spaces are derived. Due to this ISOC, the
low-energy states around the Dirac point exhibit a special spin polarization,
in which the electron spins are oppositely polarized in the upper and lower
layers. This spin polarization state is robust, protected by the time-reversal
symmetry. In addition, we provide a hybrid system to select a certain spin
polarization state by an electric manipulation.

operations and classical communication (or LOCC measurements for short) in the

discrimination procedures that attempt to identify an unknown channel, chosen
uniformly from two known alternatives, that take the following form: (i) the
input to the unknown channel is prepared in a possibly entangled state with an
ancillary system, (ii) the unknown channel is applied to the input system, and
(iii) an LOCC measurement is performed on the output and ancillary systems,
resulting in a guess for which of the two channels was given. The restriction
of the measurement in such a procedure to be an LOCC measurement is of interest
because it isolates the entanglement in the initial input/ancillary systems as
a resource in the setting of channel discrimination. We prove that there exist
channel discrimination problems for which restricted procedures of this sort

discrimination procedures (and simultaneously outperform all strategies that
make no use of entanglement), or they may be no better than unentangled

temporal properties with energy. We find that flares are narrower at higher
energies: their width follows a power-law relation w~E^{-0.5} reminiscent of
the prompt emission. Flares are asymmetric structures, with a decay time which
is twice the rise time on average. Both time scales linearly evolve with time,
giving rise to a constant rise-to-decay ratio: this implies that both time
scales are stretched by the same factor. As a consequence, the flare width
linearly evolves with time to larger values: this is a key point that clearly
distinguishes the flare from the GRB prompt emission. The flare 0.3-10 keV peak
luminosity decreases with time, following a power-law behaviour with large
scatter: L_{pk}~ t_{pk}^{-2.7}. When multiple flares are present, a global
softening trend is established: each flare is on average softer than the

average spectral energy distribution (SED) is found to be a power-law with
spectral energy index beta~1.1. These results confirmed that the flares are
tightly linked to the prompt emission. However, after considering various
models we conclude that no model is currently able to account for the entire

Changing molecular structure leads to change in the spin-spin coupling

problem. These are pole singularities in the lower half plane of the analytic
continuation of a resolvent operator from the upper half plane, across the real
axis into the lower half plane. 3) The time-decay estimates are a consequence
of resonance mode expansions for the velocity potential and bubble surface
perturbations. 4) For small compressibility (Mach number, a ratio of bubble
wall velocity to sound speed, \epsilon), this is a singular perturbation of the
incompressible limit. The scattering resonances which govern the anomalously
slow time-decay, are {\it Rayleigh resonances}. Asymptotics, supported by
high-precision numerical studies, indicate that the Rayleigh resonances which
are closest to the real axis satisfy | \frac{\Im \lambda_\star(\epsilon)}{\Re
\lambda_\star(\epsilon)} | = {\cal O} (\exp(-\kappa\ \We\ \epsilon^{-2})),
\kappa>0. Here, \We denotes the Weber number, a dimensionless ratio comparing
inertia and surface tension. 5) To obtain the above results we prove a general
result, of independent interest, estimating the Neumann to Dirichlet map for
the wave equation, exterior to a sphere.

presence of a large background magnetic field, at densities of relevance to
neutron star crusts. Using the standard approach to incorporate electron
screening through the one-loop polarization function, we show that the magnetic
field produces important corrections both at short and long distances. In
extreme fields, realized in highly magnetized neutron stars called magnetars,
electrons occupy only the lowest Landau levels in the relatively low density
region of the crust. Here our results show that the screening length for
Coulomb interactions between ions can be smaller than the inter-ion spacing.
More interestingly, we find that the screening is anisotropic and the screened
potential between two static charges exhibits long range Friedel oscillations
parallel to the magnetic field. This long-range oscillatory behavior is likely
to affect the lattice structure of ions, and can possibly create rod-like
structures in the magnetar crusts. We also calculate the imaginary part of the
electron polarization function which determines the spectrum of electron-hole
excitations and plays a role in damping lattice phonon excitations. We
demonstrate that even for modest magnetic fields this damping is highly
anisotropic and will likely lead to anisotropic phonon heat transport in the
outer neutron star crust.

1987A over a 5 year period spanning the epochs between days 6000 and 8000 since
the explosion. The supernova (SN) has evolved into a supernova remnant (SNR)
and its radiative output is dominated by the interaction of the SN blast wave
with the pre-existing equatorial ring (ER). The mid-IR spectrum is dominated by
emission from ~180 K silicate dust, collisionally-heated by the hot X-ray
emitting gas with a temperature and density of ~5x10^6 K and 3x10^4 cm-3,
respectively. The mass of the radiating dust is ~1.2x10^(-6) Msun on day 7554,
and scales linearly with IR flux. The infrared to soft-X-ray flux ratio is
roughly constant with a value of 2.5. Gas-grain collisions therefore dominate
the cooling of the shocked gas. The constancy of of this ratio suggests that
very little grain processing or gas cooling have occurred throughout this
epoch. The shape of the dust spectrum remained unchanged during the
observations while the total flux increased with a time dependence of t^(0.87),
t being the time since the first encounter between the blast wave and the ER.
These observations are consistent with the transitioning of the blast wave from
free expansion to a Sedov phase as it propagates into the main body of the ER.

$\lambda_2$ of a matrix or continuous operator. Here we focus on defining
simple Monte Carlo methods for its application. The methods presented use
random walkers of mixed signs to represent the subdominant eigenfuction.
Accordingly, the methods must cancel these signs properly in order to sample
this eigenfunction faithfully. We present a simple procedure to solve this sign
problem and then test our Monte Carlo methods by computing the $\lambda_2$ of
various Markov chain transition matrices. We first computed ${\lambda_2}$ for
several one and two dimensional Ising models, which have a discrete phase
space, and compared the relative efficiencies of the Metropolis and heat-bath
algorithms as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. Next, we
computed $\lambda_2$ for a model of an interacting gas trapped by a harmonic
potential, which has a mutidimensional continuous phase space, and studied the
efficiency of the Metropolis algorithm as a function of temperature and the
maximum allowable step size $\Delta$. Based on the $\lambda_2$ criterion, we
found for the Ising models that small lattices appear to give an adequate
picture of comparative efficiency and that the heat-bath algorithm is more
efficient than the Metropolis algorithm only at low temperatures where both
algorithms are inefficient. For the harmonic trap problem, we found that the
traditional rule-of-thumb of adjusting $\Delta$ so the Metropolis acceptance
rate is around 50% range is often sub-optimal. In general, as a function of
temperature or $\Delta$, $\lambda_2$ for this model displayed trends defining
optimal efficiency that the acceptance ratio does not. The cases studied also
suggested that Monte Carlo simulations for a continuum model are likely more
efficient than those for a discretized version of the model.

monomer of a polymer is anomalously subdiffusive, i.e., the mean-square
displacement of a tagged monomer increases as $t^\alpha$ for some $\alpha<1$
until the terminal relaxation time $\tau$ of the polymer. Beyond time $\tau$
the motion of the tagged monomer becomes diffusive. Classical examples of
anomalous dynamics in polymer physics are single polymeric systems, such as
phantom Rouse, self-avoiding Rouse, self-avoiding Zimm, reptation,
translocation through a narrow pore in a membrane, and many-polymeric systems
such as polymer melts. In this pedagogical paper I report that all these
instances of anomalous dynamics in polymeric systems are robustly characterized
by power-law memory kernels within a {\it unified} Generalized Langevin
Equation (GLE) scheme, and therefore, are non-Markovian. The exponents of the
power-law memory kernels are related to the relaxation response of the polymers
to local strains, and are derived from the equilibrium statistical physics of
polymers. The anomalous dynamics of a tagged monomer of a polymer in these
systems is then reproduced from the power-law memory kernels of the GLE via the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). Using this GLE formulation I further
show that the characteristics of the drifts caused by a (weak) applied field on
these polymeric systems are also obtained from the corresponding memory
kernels.

modulation signal at DAMA/LIBRA which avoids existing constraints from every
other dark matter direct detection experiment including CRESST, CDMS, and
XENON10. The dark matter consists of at least two light states with mass ~few
GeV and splittings ~5 keV. It is natural for the heavier states to be
cosmologically long-lived and to make up an O(1) fraction of the dark matter.
Direct detection rates are dominated by the exothermic reactions in which an
excited dark matter state down-scatters off of a nucleus, becoming a lower
energy state. In contrast to (endothermic) inelastic dark matter, the most
sensitive experiments for exothermic dark matter are those with light nuclei
and low threshold energies. Interestingly, this model can also naturally
account for the observed low-energy events at CoGeNT. The only significant
constraint on the model arises from the DAMA/LIBRA unmodulated spectrum but it
can be tested in the near future by a low-threshold analysis of CDMS-Si and
possibly other experiments including CRESST, COUPP, and XENON100.

only the radio frequency interference (RFI) can be modified to model the RFI
environment at the astronomy receivers. The RFI can then be canceled from the
astronomy signal paths. However, astronomers typically only require signal
statistics. If the RFI statistics are changing slowly, the cancellation can be
applied to the signal correlations at a much lower rate than is required for
standard adaptive filters. In this paper we describe five canceler setups;
precorrelation and postcorrelation cancelers that use one or two reference
signals in different ways. The theoretical residual RFI and added noise levels
are examined and are demonstrated using microwave television RFI at the
Australia Telescope Compact Array. The RFI is attenuated to below the system
noise, a reduction of at least 20 dB. While dual-reference cancelers add more
reference noise than single-reference cancelers, this noise is zero-mean and
only adds to the system noise, decreasing the sensitivity. The residual RFI
that remains in the output of single-reference cancelers (but not
dual-reference cancelers) sets a nonzero noise floor that does not act like
random system noise and may limit the achievable sensitivity. Thus,
dual-reference cancelers often result in superior cancellation. Dual-reference
precorrelation cancelers require a double-canceler setup to be useful and to
give equivalent results to dual-reference postcorrelation cancelers.

the high-ionization [Ne V] 14.3 and 24.3 um transitions are not detected for

formation and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), suggesting that they occupy a
continuum between pure starbursts and AGNs. This is consistent with the
hypothesis that radio galaxies are created following a galactic merger; the
timing of the radio activity onset means that contributions to the IR
luminosity from both merger-induced star formation and the central AGN are
likely. Bondi accretion is capable of powering the radio jets for almost all

accretion flow mode as a possible candidate. Merging black holes (BHs) with

4100 K. For average mass white dwarfs, these temperature estimates correspond
to cooling ages of 9-10 Gyr, distances of 70-80 pc, and tangential velocities

in highly intermittent strongly magnetized relativistic outflows. We find a new
magnetic acceleration mechanism for such impulsive flows that can be much more
effective than the acceleration of steady-state flows. This impulsive
acceleration results in kinetic-energy-dominated flows at astrophysically
relevant distances from the central source. For a spherical flow, a discrete
shell ejected from the source over a time t_0 with Lorentz factor Gamma~1 and
initial magnetization sigma_0 = B_0^2/(4 pi rho_0 c^2) >> 1 quickly reaches a
typical Lorentz factor Gamma ~ sigma_0^{1/3} and magnetization sigma ~
sigma_0^{2/3} at the distance R_0 ~ ct_0. At this point the magnetized shell of
width Delta ~ R_0 in the lab frame loses causal contact with the source and
continues to accelerate by spreading significantly in its own rest frame. The
expansion is driven by the magnetic pressure gradient and leads to relativistic
relative velocities between the front and back of the shell. While the
expansion is roughly symmetric in the center of momentum frame, in the lab
frame most of the energy and momentum remain in a region (or shell) of width
Delta ~ R_0 at the head of the flow. This acceleration proceeds as Gamma ~
(sigma_0 R/R_0)^{1/3} and sigma ~ sigma_0^{2/3} (R/R_0)^{-1/3} until reaching a
coasting radius R_c ~ R_0 sigma_0^2 where the kinetic energy becomes dominant:
Gamma ~ sigma_0 and sigma ~ 1 at R_c. Then the shell starts coasting and
spreading (radially) causing its magnetization to drop as sigma ~ R_c/R at
R>R_c. Given the typical variability time-scales of AGN and GRBs, the magnetic
acceleration in these sources is a combination of the quasi-steady-state
collimation acceleration close to the source and the impulsive acceleration
further out. The interaction with the external medium is briefly discussed.

find that the stacked LAEs have low stellar masses of ~(3-10)*10^7 Msun, very
young ages of ~1-3 Myr, negligible dust extinction, and strong nebular emission
from the ionized interstellar medium, although the z=6.6 object is fitted
similarly well with high-mass models without nebular emission; inclusion of

solution in the general inhomogeneous case (Bruscolini and Pelizzola, 2002)
which facilitates the study of realistic systems. However, a shortcoming of the
model is that it accounts only for interactions within continuous stretches of
native bonds or atomic chains while neglecting interstretch (interchain)
interactions. But due to the biopolymer (atomic chain) flexibility, the
monomers (atoms) separated by several non-native bonds along the sequence can
become closely spaced. This produces their strong interaction. The inclusion of
non-WSME interactions into the model makes the model more realistic and
improves its performance. In this study we add arbitrary interactions of finite

therefore exactly account for the interactions which in proteomics are

and Fe/Si in dust are close to 1.5. For disk stars they are reduced to ${\rm

1) the dust grains cannot be the mixture of silicates with olivine and pyroxene
composition only and some amount of magnesium or iron (or both) should be in
another population and 2) the destruction of Mg-rich grains in the warm medium
is more effective than of Fe-rich grains. We reveal a decrease of dust-phase
abundances and correspondingly an increase of gas-phase abundances with
distance $D$ for stars with $D\ga 400$\,pc. We attribute this fact to an
observational selection effect: a systematic trend toward smaller observed
hydrogen column density for distant stars. We find differences in abundances
for disk stars with low ($E({\rm B-V}) \la 0.2$) and high ($E({\rm B-V}) \ga

randomly varying network topology to update his information state. We assume a
state-dependent communication model over this topology: communication is
Markovian with respect to the states of the agents and the probability with

paper, we study a projected multi-agent subgradient algorithm under
state-dependent communication. The algorithm involves each agent performing a
local averaging to combine his estimate with the other agents' estimates,
taking a subgradient step along his local objective function, and projecting
the estimates on his local constraint set. The state-dependence of the
communication introduces significant challenges and couples the study of
information exchange with the analysis of subgradient steps and projection
errors. We first show that the multi-agent subgradient algorithm when used with
a constant stepsize may result in the agent estimates to diverge with
probability one. Under some assumptions on the stepsize sequence, we provide
convergence rate bounds on a ""disagreement metric"" between the agent estimates.
Our bounds are time-nonhomogeneous in the sense that they depend on the initial

essential not only to test alternative models of the physics of the early
universe but also to discriminate among classes of inflationary models. Given
this far reaching consequences of such a non-Gaussianity detection for our
understanding of the physics of the early universe, it is important to employ
alternative indicators in order to have further information about the
Gaussianity features of CMB that may be helpful for identifying their origins.
In this way, a considerable effort has recently gone into the design of
non-Gaussianity indicators, and in their application in the search for
deviation from Gaussianity in the CMB data. Recently we have proposed two new
large-angle non-Gaussianity indicators which provide measures of the departure
from Gaussianity on large angular scales. We have used these indicators to
carry out analyses of Gaussianity of the single frequency bands and of the
available foreground-reduced {\it five-year} maps with and without the KQ75
mask. Here we extend and complement these studies by performing a new analysis
of deviation from Gaussianity of the {\it three-year} harmonic ILC (HILC)
foreground-reduced full-sky and KQ75 masked maps obtained from WMAP data. We
show that this full-sky foreground-reduced maps presents a significant
deviation from Gaussianity, which is brought down to a level of consistency
with Gaussianity when the KQ75 mask is employed.

observed by GALEX and Spitzer. For interacting galaxies with separations
greater than the resolution of GALEX and Spitzer (2-6""), we assess the UV and

measured SFR ranges from 0.2% to 17.9%, with a median of 2.8% and a mean of 4.0

high, with a median value (3.9*10^{-10} yr^{-1}) that is comparable to the
highest specific star formation rates seen in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby
Galaxies Survey sample. We examine the position of each galaxy on the IR
excess-UV slope (IRX-beta) diagram as a function of galaxy properties,
including IR luminosity and interaction stage. The LIRGs on average have
greater IR excesses than would be expected based on their UV colors if they
obeyed the same relations as starbursts with L_IR < 10^{11}L_0 or normal
late-type galaxies. The ratio of L_IR to the value one would estimate from the

from 0.2 to 68, with a median value of 2.7. A minimum of 19% of the total IR
luminosity in the RBGS is produced in LIRGs and ULIRGs with red UV colors (beta

dominates the IR emission while the companion dominates the UV emission. Only

self-assembly. We employ a variant of Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model
(aTAM), the two-handed aTAM, in which square ""tiles"" -- a model of molecules
constructed from DNA for the purpose of engineering self-assembled
nanostructures -- aggregate according to specific binding sites of varying
strengths, and in which large aggregations of tiles may attach to each other,
in contrast to the seeded aTAM, in which tiles aggregate one at a time to a
single specially-designated ""seed"" assembly. We focus on a major cause of
errors in tile-based self-assembly: that of unintended growth due to ""weak""
strength-1 bonds, which if allowed to persist, may be stabilized by subsequent
attachment of neighboring tiles in the sense that at least energy 2 is now
required to break apart the resulting assembly; i.e., the errant assembly is
stable at temperature 2. We study a common self-assembly benchmark problem,
that of assembling an n x n square using O(log n) unique tile types, under the
two-handed model of self-assembly. Our main result achieves a much stronger
notion of fault-tolerance than those achieved previously. Arbitrary strength-1
growth is allowed (i.e., the temperature is ""fuzzy"" and may drift from 2 to 1
for arbitrarily long); however, any assembly that grows sufficiently to become
stable at temperature 2 is guaranteed to assemble at temperature 2 into the
correct final assembly of an n x n square. In other words, errors due to
insufficient attachment, which is the cause of errors studied in earlier papers
on fault-tolerance, are prevented absolutely in our main construction, rather
than only with high probability and for sufficiently small structures, as in
previous fault-tolerance studies.

to be holographically dual to two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories
(CFTs) with left and right central charges c_L=c_R=12J. In this paper it is
observed that the 2D conformal symmetry of the scalar wave equation at low
frequencies persists for generic non-extreme values of the mass M.
Interestingly, this conformal symmetry is not derived from a conformal symmetry
of the spacetime geometry except in the extreme limit. The periodic
identification of the azimuthal angle is shown to correspond to a spontaneous
breaking of the conformal symmetry by left and right temperatures (T_L,T_R).
The well-known low-frequency scalar-Kerr scattering amplitudes coincide with
correlators of a 2D CFT at these temperatures. Moreover the CFT microstate
degeneracy inferred from the Cardy formula agrees exactly with the
Bekenstein-Hawking area law for all M and J. These observations provide
evidence for the conjecture that the Kerr black hole is dual to a c_L=c_R=12J
2D CFT at temperatures (T_L,T_R) for every value of M and J.

the separation of elementary particles into the two classes of vector C-even

type of lepton corresponds a kind of neutrino. Such pairs are united in
families of a different C-parity. Unlike the neutrino of a vector type, any
C-noninvariant Dirac neutrino must have his Majorana neutrino. They constitute
the purely neutrino families. We discuss the nature of a corresponding
mechanism responsible for the availability in all types of axial-vector
particles of a kind of flavour which distinguishes each of them from others by
a true charge characterized by a quantum number conserved at the interactions
between the C-odd fermion and the field of emission of the corresponding types
of gauge bosons. This regularity expresses the unidenticality of truly neutral
neutrino and antineutrino, confirming that an internal symmetry of a
C-noninvariant particle is described by an axial-vector space. Thereby, a true
flavour together with the earlier known lepton flavour predicts the existence
of leptonic strings and their birth in single and double beta decays as a unity
of flavour and gauge symmetry laws. Such a unified principle explains the
availability of a flavour symmetrical mode of neutrino oscillations.

metallicities adopted in our work were from literature. We fitted the
correlations of seventy-eight different BATC colors and the metallicities for
123 old confirmed globular clusters, and the result implies that correlation
coefficients of twenty-three colors r>0.7. Especially, for the colors
$(f-k)_0$, $(f-o)_0$, and $(h-k)_0$, the correlation coefficients are r>0.8.
Meanwhile, we also note that the correlation coefficients (r) approach zero for
$(g-h)_0$, $(k-m)_0$, $(k-n)_0$, and $(m-n)_0$, which are likely to be
independent of metallicity. Similarity, we fitted the correlations of
metallicity and ugrizK colors for 127 old confirmed GCs. The result indicates
that all these colors are metal-sensitive (r>0.7), of which $(u-K)_0$ is the

model the movie-rating prediction problem popularized by the Netflix Prize,

we develop a new MP algorithm, termed IMP, for learning the model. To show
superiority of the IMP algorithm, we compare it with the closely related
expectation-maximization (EM) based algorithm and a number of other matrix
completion algorithms. Our simulation results on Netflix data show that, while
the methods perform similarly with large amounts of data, the IMP algorithm is
superior for small amounts of data. This improves the cold-start problem of the
CF systems in practice. Another advantage of the IMP algorithm is that it can
be analyzed using the technique of density evolution (DE) that was originally
developed for MP decoding of error-correcting codes.

800 nm on the 1800 nm luminescence from the 3F4 level confirms that the 3H4
level is populated by a two photon process. Two possible processes are proposed
as mechanisms responsible for the up-conversion: excited state absorption and
energy transfer up-conversion. The decay characteristics of the luminescence
from the 3H4 level were studied under direct and indirect pumping at 786 and
1586 nm, respectively. By comparing the decay waveforms to the solution of a
simple set of rate equations, the energy transfer up-conversion process (3F4,
3F4 ! 3H4, 3H6) was established at Tm2O3 concentrations greater than 200 ppm.

Measurements, defined in the proposed protocol, have, as main goal, to
establish if peaks quantification predicts realistic concentration values,
meaning that, the occurrence of this event is a sufficient condition to declare
that MRS system works good. Moreover, stability measurements helps in a correct
data understanding. It is, indeed, realistic to think that environmental
condition can introduce casual errors in the working good system. Discrepancies
in the working good condition, under stochastic variability (environment), have
to be related to systematic errors introduced by the set of pre and/or
post-processing operations and/or by any forms of MRS bad-working tool that
differs from the previous. The quality control minimal protocol has been
executed on a Philips-Achieva MRS system utilizing a phantom supplied by the

performance tests. The reproducibility of the MRS measurements helps in
quantifying the stability of the system. The performance test enables to
establish if the system is able to reproduce concentrations in a realistic way.
In both cases good results have been obtained: fluctuations of measured values
are below 9% and quantification of concentration is consistent with the known

body axis of Drosophila by binding to transcriptional enhancers across the
genome. Each such enhancer activates a neighboring gene at a unique threshold
concentration of Dorsal. The presence of Dorsal binding site clusters in these
enhancers and of similar clusters in other enhancers has motivated models of
threshold-encoding in site density. However, we found that the precise length
of a spacer separating a pair of specialized Dorsal and Twist binding sites
determines the threshold-response. Despite this result, the functional range
determined by this spacer element as well as the role and origin of its
surrounding Dorsal site cluster remained completely unknown. Here, we
experiment with enhancers from diverse Drosophila genomes, including the large
uncompacted genomes from ananassae and willistoni, and report three major
interdependent results. First, we map the functional range of the
threshold-encoding spacer variable. Second, we show that the majority of sites
at the cluster are non-functional divergent elements that have been separated
beyond the encoding's functional range. Third, we verify an evolutionary model
involving the frequent replacement of a threshold encoding, whose precision is
easily outdated by shifting accuracy. The process by which encodings are
replaced by newer ones is facilitated by the palindromic nature of the Dorsal
and Twist binding motifs and by intrinsic repeat-instability in the specialized
Twist binding site, which critically impacts the length of the spacer linking
it to Dorsal. Over time, the dynamic process of selective deprecation and
replacement of encodings adds to a growing cluster of deadened elements, or

strategy is to first construct a pseudo spin Hamiltonian which is defined not

correspondence between the pseudo-spin-1 configurations and those of dimers.
The standard QDM keeps only the lowest resonance processes for pairs of
parallel dimers and its validity in describing the realistic spin systems is
not obvious. Our extended QDM (EQDM) improves this point and contains a novel
resonance term, which is equivalent to two successive actions of the familiar
parallel dimer resonance. For a certain choice of the coupling constants, our
model exhibits three exotic valence-bond phases (herringbone, checkerboard and
'dimer smectic') in the ground state, which meet at a triple point. The
checkerboard phase has four-fold rotational symmetry, while the dimer smectic
is characterized by partial ordering only in one of the two directions. In the
dimer smectic phase, we investigate the dimer-dimer correlation by using an

all leaves closed is the cohomology of the leaf space. In this paper we
introduce various methods to compute the basic cohomology in the presence of

generally for Killing foliations): We show that the total basic Betti number of
the union C of the closed leaves is smaller than or equal to the total basic
Betti number of the foliated manifold, and we give sufficient conditions for

convex polytope. Our results are based on Molino's observation that the
existence of non-closed leaves yields a distinguished transverse action on the

electron-magneto-hydrodynamics limit is responsible for the Hall drift of the
magnetic field and, in some cases, for the so-called Hall instability. We
investigate whether or not the growth rates and eigenfunctions found in the
linear analysis are consistent with the results of non-linear numerical
simulations. Following the linear analysis of Rheinhardt & Geppert, we study
the same cases for which the Hall instability was predicted by solving the
non-linear Hall induction equation using a two-dimensional conservative and
divergence-free finite difference scheme that overcomes intrinsic difficulties
of pseudo-spectral methods and can describe situations with arbitrarily high
magnetic Reynolds numbers. We show that unstable modes can grow to the level of
the background field without being overwhelmed by the Hall cascade, and cause a
complete rearrangement of the field geometry. We confirm both the growth rates
and eigenfunctions found in the linearized analysis and hence the instability.
In the non-linear regime, after the unstable modes grow to the background
level, the naturally selected modes become stable and oscillatory. Later on,
the evolution tends to select the modes with the longest possible wavelengths,
but this process occurs on the magnetic diffusion timescale. We confirm the
existence of the Hall instability. We argue against using the misleading
terminology that associates the non-linear Hall term with a turbulent Hall
cascade, since small-scale structures are not created everywhere. The field
evolves instead in a Burgers-like manner, forms local structures with strong
gradients which become shocks in the zero resistivity limit, and Hall waves are
launched and propagated through the entire domain.

water masers reported here are new discoveries. Variability in the masers is
often acute, with very few features directly corresponding to those discovered
two decades ago. Within our current observations, less than a year apart,
spectra are often dissimilar, but positions at the later epoch, even when
measured for slightly different features, mostly correspond to the detected
maser site measured earlier, to within the typical extent of the whole site, of
a few arcseconds. The precise water positions show that approximately 79% (160

estimate yet obtained for this statistic; however, there are many instances
where additional water sites are present offset from the OH target, and
consequently less than half of the water masers coincide with a 1665-MHz

use reliable prior information via certain constraints, i.e., linear
constraints without empirical parameters. However, reliable prior information
is often insufficient, and the selection of uncertain constraints becomes
necessary but poses considerable implementation complexity. Improper setting of
uncertain constraints can result in overfitting or underfitting. To solve this
problem, a generalization of Maxent, under Tsallis entropy framework, is
proposed. The proposed method introduces a convex quadratic constraint for the
correction of (expected) Tsallis entropy bias (TEB). Specifically, we
demonstrate that the expected Tsallis entropy of sampling distributions is
smaller than the Tsallis entropy of the underlying real distribution. This
expected entropy reduction is exactly the (expected) TEB, which can be
expressed by a closed-form formula and act as a consistent and unbiased
correction. TEB indicates that the entropy of a specific sampling distribution
should be increased accordingly. This entails a quantitative re-interpretation
of the Maxent principle. By compensating TEB and meanwhile forcing the
resulting distribution to be close to the sampling distribution, our
generalized TEBC Maxent can be expected to alleviate the overfitting and
underfitting. We also present a connection between TEB and Lidstone estimator.
As a result, TEB-Lidstone estimator is developed by analytically identifying
the rate of probability correction in Lidstone. Extensive empirical evaluation
shows promising performance of both TEBC Maxent and TEB-Lidstone in comparison
with various state-of-the-art density estimation methods.

model of patchy spheres, each of whose surfaces is decorated with two opposite
attractive caps, as a function of the fraction $\chi$ of covered attractive
surface. The simple model explored --- the two-patch Kern-Frenkel model ---
interpolates between a square-well and a hard-sphere potential on changing the
coverage $\chi$. We show that integral equation theory provides quantitative
predictions in the entire explored region of temperatures and densities from
the square-well limit $\chi = 1.0$ down to $\chi \approx 0.6$. For smaller
$\chi$, good numerical convergence of the equations is achieved only at
temperatures larger than the gas-liquid critical point, where however integral
equation theory provides a complete description of the angular dependence.
These results are contrasted with those for the one-patch case. We investigate
the remaining region of coverage via numerical simulation and show how the
gas-liquid critical point moves to smaller densities and temperatures on
decreasing $\chi$. Below $\chi \approx 0.3$, crystallization prevents the
possibility of observing the evolution of the line of critical points,
providing the angular analog of the disappearance of the liquid as an
equilibrium phase on decreasing the range for spherical potentials. Finally, we
show that the stable ordered phase evolves on decreasing $\chi$ from a
three-dimensional crystal of interconnected planes to a two-dimensional
independent-planes structure to a one-dimensional fluid of chains when the
one-bond-per-patch limit is eventually reached.

investigated this coupling by studying the black hole candidate Swift
J1753.5-0127, via multiwavelength coordinated observations over a period of ~4
years. We present the results of our campaign showing that, all along the

empirical correlation between the radio and the X-ray luminosities in hard
spectral state. Because the jet is so weak in this system the near-infrared

emission from the accretion disc. We briefly discuss the importance and the
implications of a precise determination of both the slope and the normalisation
of the correlations, listing some possible parameters that broadband jet models
should take into account to explain the population of sources characterized by
a dim jet. We also investigate whether our data can give any hint about the

bright inner lobes (ILs) have an angular size of ~1.5""x1"" each and display
closed, bow-shaped ends. The extended, faint outer lobes (OLs), which enclose
the inner ones, have an agular size of ~13""x10"". Within the ILs and the OLs the
velocity increases with the distance to the center, however, the ILs show
expansion velocities larger than the OLs. Consistent with the large speeds
reached by the ILs (of up to ~350 km/s at the tips), we have measured the
expansive proper motions of the knots (~0.03 arcsec/yr) by comparing two-epoch
HST images. Moreover, we have discovered remarkable changes with time in the
continuum and line emission spectrum of M2-56. In 1998, we detected a burst of
Halpha emission from the nebula nucleus that is interpreted as an indication of
a dense, fast (~350-500 km/s) bipolar wind from the nebula's core (referred to
as ""F1-wind""). Such a wind has been recently ejected (after 1989) probably as a
short-duration mass-loss event. Our data also reveal an optically thick,
compact structure (cocoon?) and a HII region around the central star that
result from further post-AGB mass-loss after the F1-wind. Recent brightening of
the scattered stellar continuum as well as an increase of scattered Halpha
emission along the lobes is reported, both results pointing to a decrease of
the optical depth of the circumstellar material enshrouding the star. The data
presented here unveil the complex post-AGB mass-loss history of this object,
whose rapid evolution is driven by multiple episodes of mass outflow, not
regularly spaced in time... (abridged).

extragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on the
extragalactic background light photons. Extragalactic magnetic fields alter the
trajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic background
photons to gamma-ray energies by inverse Compton scattering. These secondary
photons can form an extended halo around bright VHE sources.
  Aims: We searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars Mrk 421
and Mrk 501 using the MAGIC telescope data.
  Methods: If extended emission is present, the angular distribution of
reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader than
for a point-like source. In the analysis of a few tens of hours of
observational data taken from Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 we used a newly developed
method that provides better angular resolution. This method is based on the
usage of multidimensional decision trees. Comparing the measured shapes of
angular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one can
detect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. We also
studied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape of
the distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a point
source.
  Results: We present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for both
sources for various source extensions and emission profiles. We discuss
possible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. We obtain
upper limits on the extended emission around the Mrk~421 (Mrk~501) on the level
of < 5% (< 4%) of the Crab Nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 GeV.
Using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalactic
magnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~G.

energies are discussed as an innovative approach for probing the transient
regime experienced by fissile systems evolving towards quasi-equilibrium. A
dedicated experiment using the advanced technical installations of GSI,
Darmstadt, permitted to realize ideal conditions for the investigation of
relaxation effects in the meta-stable well. Combined with a highly sensitive
experimental signature, it provides a measure of the transient effects with
respect to the flux over the fission barrier. Within a two-step reaction
process, 45 proton-rich unstable spherical isotopes produced by
projectile-fragmentation of a stable 238U beam have been used as secondary
projectiles. The fragmentation of the radioactive projectiles on lead results
in nearly spherical compound nuclei which span a wide range in excitation
energy and fissility. The decay of these excited systems by fission is studied
with a dedicated set-up which permits the detection of both fission products in
coincidence and the determination of their atomic numbers with high resolution.
The width of the fission-fragment nuclear charge distribution is shown to be
specifically sensitive to pre-saddle transient effects and is used to establish
a clock for the passage of the saddle point. The comparison of the experimental
results with model calculations points to a fission delay of (3.3+/-0.7).10-21s
for initially spherical compound nuclei, independent of excitation energy and
fissility. This value suggests a nuclear dissipation strength at small
deformation of (4.5+/-0.5).1021s-1. The very specific combination of the
physics and technical equipment exploited in this work sheds light on previous
controversial conclusions.

older stellar populations than the higher radio luminosity group. Our sample is
also fairly well divided by optical spectral classification. We find that
galaxies classified as having low excitation spectra (LEGs) possess older
stellar populations than high excitation line objects (HEGs), with the HEGs
showing evidence for recent star formation. We also investigate the link
between radio morphology, as used by Owen & Laing (1989), and the stellar
populations. We find that there is a preference for the ""fat-double"" sources to
have older stellar populations than the ""classical double"" sources, although
this is also linked to these sources lying predominantly in the LEG and HEG
categories respectively. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
HEGs are powered by accretion of cold gas, which could be supplied, for
example, by recent mergers, secular instabilities, or filamentary cold flows.
These processes could also trigger star formation in the host galaxy. The host
galaxies of the LEGs do not show evidence for recent star formation and an
influx of cold gas, and are consistent with being powered by the accretion of
the hot phase of the inter-stellar medium.

responsible for a variety of correlation induced phases, in this paper we
investigate the effect of substitutional doping of Cu into diamond. Our
extensive first principle calculations averaged over various geometries based

mainly arises from the $t_{2g}$ and $4p$ states of Cu. For impurity
concentrations of more than $\sim 1%, the effect of $2p$ bands of neighboring

$t_{2g}$ band, and a half-filled band of $4p$ states. Increasing the

Kugo-Ojima function, in order to extract the non-perturbative behavior of two
particular definitions of the QCD effective charge, one based on the pinch
technique construction, and one obtained from the standard ghost-gluon vertex.
The construction relies crucially on the definition of two dimensionful
quantities, which are invariant under the renormalization group, and are built
out of very particular combinations of the aforementioned Green's functions.
The main non-perturbative feature of both effective charges, encoded in the
infrared finiteness of the gluon propagator and ghost dressing function used in
their definition, is the freezing at a common finite (non-vanishing) value, in
agreement with a plethora of theoretical and phenomenological expectations. We
discuss the sizable discrepancy between the freezing values obtained from the
present lattice analysis and the corresponding estimates derived from several
phenomenological studies, and attribute its origin to the difference in the
gauges employed. A particular toy calculation suggests that the modifications
induced to the non-perturbative gluon propagator by the gauge choice may indeed
account for the observed deviation of the freezing values.

environment for 12150 SDSS galaxies with precise visual classifications from
the catalog of Nair & Abraham (2010a). Our analysis is subdivided into
investigations of early-type galaxies and late-type galaxies. Early-type
galaxies reveal a surprisingly tight luminosity-size relation. The dispersion
in luminosity about the fiducial relation is only ~0.14 dex (0.35 mag), even
though the sample contains galaxies which differ by a factor of almost 100 in
luminosity. The dispersion about the luminosity-size relation is comparable to
the dispersion about the fundamental plane, even though the luminosity-size
relation is fundamentally simpler and computed using purely photometric
parameters. The key contributors to the dispersion about the luminosity-size
relation are found to be color and central concentration. Expanding our
analysis to the full range of morphological types, we show that the slope, zero
point, and scatter about the luminosity-size relation is independent of
environmental density. Our study thus indicates that whatever process is
building galaxies is doing so in a way that preserves fundamental scaling laws
even as the typical luminosity of galaxies changes with environment. However,
the distribution of galaxies along the luminosity-size relation is found to be
strongly dependent on galaxy environment. This variation is in the sense that,
at a given morphology, larger and more luminous galaxies are rarer in sparser
environments. Our analysis of late-type galaxy morphologies reveals that
scatter increases towards later Hubble types. Taken together, these results
place strong constraints on conventional hierarchical models in which galaxies
are built up in an essentially stochastic way.

cosmology of some possible nonclassical properties of spacetime at the Planck
scale. The new effects, such as a Planck-scale-modified energy-momentum
(dispersion) relation, are often inferred from the analysis of some quantum
versions of Minkowski spacetime, and therefore the relevant estimates depend
heavily on the assumption that there could not be significant interplay between
Planck-scale and curvature effects. We here scrutinize this assumption, using
as guidance a quantum version of de Sitter spacetime with known Inonu-Wigner
contraction to a quantum Minkowski spacetime. And we show that, contrary to
common (but unsupported) beliefs, the interplay between Planck-scale and
curvature effects can be significant. Within our illustrative example, in the
Minkowski limit the quantum-geometry deformation parameter is indeed given by
the Planck scale, while in the de Sitter picture the parameter of quantization
of geometry depends both on the Planck scale and the curvature scalar. For the
much-studied case of Planck-scale effects that intervene in the observation of
gamma-ray bursts we can estimate the implications of ""quantum spacetime
curvature"" within robust simplifying assumptions. For cosmology at the present
stage of the development of the relevant mathematics one cannot go beyond
semiheuristic reasoning, and we here propose a candidate approximate
description of a quantum FRW geometry, obtained by patching together pieces
(with different spacetime curvature) of our quantum de Sitter. This
semiheuristic picture, in spite of its limitations, provides rather robust
evidence that in the early Universe the interplay between Planck-scale and
curvature effects could have been particularly significant.

models, where it is easy to simulate from the models, but impossible to
calculate likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a method of
inference for such models. It replaces calculation of the likelihood by a step
which involves simulating artificial data for different parameter values, and
comparing summary statistics of the simulated data to summary statistics of the
observed data. Here we show how to construct appropriate summary statistics for
ABC in a semi-automatic manner. We aim for summary statistics which will enable
inference about certain parameters of interest to be as accurate as possible.
Theoretical results show that optimal summary statistics are the posterior
means of the parameters. While these cannot be calculated analytically, we use
an extra stage of simulation to estimate how the posterior means vary as a
function of the data; and then use these estimates of our summary statistics
within ABC. Empirical results show that our approach is a robust method for
choosing summary statistics, that can result in substantially more accurate ABC
analyses than the ad-hoc choices of summary statistics proposed in the
literature. We also demonstrate advantages over two alternative methods of
simulation-based inference.

energy band structure, resulting in wider plateaus when the electron density is
increased due to larger energy-level separation as the higher subbands are
occupied by electrons. The nonlinear dependence of the transverse confinement
on position with respect to the well center excludes the ""pole-like feature"" in
the conductance which is obtained when a harmonic potential is employed for

non-degenerate symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear form, assuming that the
orbit does not vanish in the presence of such a form. Replacing $G$ by any
simple classical algebraic group we thus obtain a unified approach to computing
representatives for nilpotent orbits of all classical Lie algebras. By applying
Springer morphisms, this also yields representatives for the corresponding
unipotent classes in $G$. As a corollary we obtain a complete set of generic
