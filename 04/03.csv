emerged as a serious contender for a nonperturbative description of the theory.
It is a nonperturbative implementation of the sum-over-histories, which relies
on few ingredients and initial assumptions, has few free parameters and -
crucially - is amenable to numerical simulations. It is the only approach to
have demonstrated that a classical universe can be generated dynamically from
Planckian quantum fluctuations. At the same time, it allows for the explicit
evaluation of expectation values of invariants characterizing the highly
nonclassical, short-distance behaviour of spacetime. As an added bonus, we have
learned important lessons on which aspects of spacetime need to be fixed a
priori as part of the background structure and which can be expected to emerge
dynamically.

climate system, but their direct impact on atmospheric dynamics has escaped
wide attention. Here we examine and advance a theory as to how condensation
influences atmospheric pressure through the mass removal of water from the gas
phase with a simultaneous account of the latent heat release. Building from the
fundamental physical principles we show that condensation is associated with a
decline in air pressure in the lower atmosphere. This decline occurs up to a
certain height, which ranges from 3 to 4 km for surface temperatures from 10 to
30 deg C. We then estimate the horizontal pressure differences associated with
water vapor condensation and find that these are comparable in magnitude with
the pressure differences driving observed circulation patterns. The water vapor
delivered to the atmosphere via evaporation represents a store of potential
energy available to accelerate air and thus drive winds. Our estimates suggest
that the global mean power at which this potential energy is released by
condensation is around one per cent of the global solar power -- this is
similar to the known stationary dissipative power of general atmospheric
circulation. We conclude that condensation and evaporation merit attention as
major, if previously overlooked, factors in driving atmospheric dynamics.

independent decisions. We consider a collection of agents, each performing
binary hypothesis testing and each obtaining a decision over time. We assume
the agents are identical and receive independent information. Individual
decisions are sequentially aggregated via a threshold-based rule. In other
words, a collective decision is taken as soon as a specified number of agents
report a concordant decision (simultaneous discordant decisions and no-decision
outcomes are also handled).
  We obtain the following results. First, we characterize the probabilities of
correct and wrong decisions as a function of time, group size and decision
threshold. The computational requirements of our approach are linear in the
group size. Second, we consider the so-called fastest and majority rules,
corresponding to specific decision thresholds. For these rules, we provide a
comprehensive scalability analysis of both accuracy and decision time. In the
limit of large group sizes, we show that the decision time for the fastest rule
converges to the earliest possible individual time, and that the decision
accuracy for the majority rule shows an exponential improvement over the
individual accuracy. Additionally, via a theoretical and numerical analysis, we
characterize various speed/accuracy tradeoffs. Finally, we relate our results
to some recent observations reported in the cognitive information processing

observations. Cepheid models indicate that the slope of the Period-Luminosity
(P-L) relation covering the entire period range (0.40<= logP <=2.0) becomes
steeper when moving from optical to NIR bands, and that the metallicity
dependence of the slope decreases from the B- to the K-band. We estimated V-
and I-band slopes for 87 Cepheid data sets belonging to 48 external galaxies
with nebular oxygen abundance 7.5<= 12+log (O/H) <=8.9. By using Cepheid
samples including more than 20 Cepheids, the chi^2 test indicates that the
hypothesis of a steepening of the P-L_{V,I} relations with increased
metallicity can be discarded at the 99% level. On the contrary, the observed
slopes agree with the metallicity trend predicted by pulsation models, i.e. the
slope is roughly constant for galaxies with 12+log (O/H) < 8.17 and becomes
shallower in the metal-rich regime, with a confidence level of 62% and 92%,
respectively. The chi^2 test concerning the hypothesis that the slope does not
depend on metallicity gives confidence levels either similar (P-L_V, 62%) or
smaller (P-L_I, 67%). We found that the slopes of optical and NIR
Period-Wesenheit (P-W) relations in external galaxies are similar to the slopes
of LMC. On this ground, the P-W relations provide robust distances relative to
the LMC, but theory and observations indicate that the metallicity dependence
of the zero-point in the different passbands has to be taken into account. We
compared the galaxy distances provided by Rizzi et al. (2007) using the TRGB
with our set of Cepheid distances based on the P-W relations. We found that the
metallicity correction on distances based on the P-WBV relation is
gamma_(B,V)=-0.52 mag dex^-1, whereas it is vanishing for the distances based
on the P-WVI and on the P-WJK relations. These findings fully support Cepheid
theoretical predictions.

similarly to the voter model includes social influence, but unlike the voter
model also accounts for homophily. Each vertex of the network of interactions
is characterized by a set of $F$ cultural features, each of which can assume
$q$ states. Pairs of adjacent vertices interact at a rate proportional to the
number of features they share, which results in the interacting pair having one
more cultural feature in common. The Axelrod model has been extensively studied
during the past ten years, based on numerical simulations and simple mean-field
treatments, while there is a total lack of analytical results for the spatial
model itself. Simulation results for the one-dimensional system led physicists
to formulate the following conjectures. When the number of features $F$ and the
number of states $q$ both equal two, or when the number of features exceeds the
number of states, the system converges to a monocultural equilibrium in the
sense that the number of cultural domains rescaled by the population size
converges to zero as the population goes to infinity. In contrast, when the
number of states exceeds the number of features, the system freezes in a highly
fragmented configuration in which the ultimate number of cultural domains
scales like the population size. In this article, we prove analytically for the
one-dimensional system convergence to a monocultural equilibrium in terms of
clustering when $F=q=2$, as well as fixation to a highly fragmented
configuration when the number of states is sufficiently larger than the number
of features. Our first result also implies clustering of the one-dimensional

that the there is little observational difference between a Schwarzschild black

not be a useful probe of electrical charge in black holes. A negative value for
the $\frac{1}{r^2}$ term can enter through modified gravity scenarios. Although
physically unlikely to apply in the case of a large black hole, the
Randall-Sundrum II braneworld scenario admits a metric of this form, known as
tidal Reissner- Nordstrom (TRN) metric. We use values of tidal charge (Q in
$\frac{Q}{r^2}$) ranging from $-1.6M^2$ to $0.4 M^2$. A negative value of Q
enhances the brightness of images at all times and creates an increase in
brightness of up to 0.4 magnitudes for the secondary image of the star S2 at
periapse. We show that for other stars with brighter secondary images and
positions more aligned with the optic axis, using the Tidal Reissner-Nordstrom

wavelengths. The structure function analysis indicate most of the power

also report minute time scale variability at 7 and 13mm placing a strong
constraint on the nature of the variable emission. The hourly time scale
variability can be explained in the context of a model in which the peak
frequency of emission shifts toward lower frequencies as a self-absorbed
synchrotron source expands adiabatically near the acceleration site. The short
time scale variability, on the other hand, places a strong constraint on the
size of the emitting region. Assuming that rapid minute time scale fluctuations
of the emission is optically thick in radio wavelength, light travel arguments
requires relativistic particle energy, thus suggesting the presence of outflow

communication among sensors is random; each sensor occasionally exchanges its
filtering state information with a neighbor depending on the availability of
the appropriate network link. We show that under a weak distributed
detectability condition:
  1. the GIKF error process remains stochastically bounded, irrespective of the

networks offers considerable improvement in spectral efficiency. This gain,
often referred to as \emph{multiuser diversity gain}, can be cast as
double-logarithmic growth of the network throughput with the number of users.
In this paper we consider large cognitive networks granted concurrent spectrum
access with license-holding users. The primary network affords to share its
under-utilized spectrum bands with the secondary users. We assess the optimal
multiuser diversity gain in the cognitive networks by quantifying how the
sum-rate throughput of the network scales with the number of secondary users.
For this purpose we look at the optimal pairing of spectrum bands and secondary
users, which is supervised by a central entity fully aware of the instantaneous
channel conditions, and show that the throughput of the cognitive network
scales double-logarithmically with the number of secondary users ($N$) and
linearly with the number of available spectrum bands ($M$), i.e., $M\log\log
N$. We then propose a \emph{distributed} spectrum allocation scheme, which does
not necessitate a central controller or any information exchange between
different secondary users and still obeys the optimal throughput scaling law.
This scheme requires that \emph{some} secondary transmitter-receiver pairs
exchange $\log M$ information bits among themselves. We also show that the
aggregate amount of information exchange between secondary transmitter-receiver
pairs is {\em asymptotically} equal to $M\log M$. Finally, we show that our
distributed scheme guarantees fairness among the secondary users, meaning that
they are equally likely to get access to an available spectrum band.

We first compare model predictions against the luminosity function measured at
z=5 and z=4. We then predict the luminosity function at z>=7 under the sole
assumption of evolution in the underlying dark-matter halo mass function. Our
model is consistent with the observed z>6.5 galaxy number counts in the HUDF
survey and suggests a possible steepening of the faint-end slope of the
luminosity function: alpha(z>8)< -1.9 compared to alpha=-1.74 at z=6. Although
we currently see only the brightest galaxies, a hidden population of lower
luminosity objects (L/L_{*}> 10^{-4}) might provide >75% of the total
reionizing flux. Assuming escape fraction f_{esc}~0.2, clumping factor C~5, top
heavy-IMF and low metallicity, galaxies below the detection limit produce
complete reionization at z>8. For solar metallicity and normal stellar IMF,
reionization finishes at z>6, but a smaller C/f_{esc} is required for an
optical depth consistent with the WMAP measurement. Our model highlights that
the star formation rate in sub-L_* galaxies has a quasi-linear relation to
dark-matter halo mass, suggesting that radiative and mechanical feedback were
less effective at z>6 than today.

studies of mass loss from the brightest stars derive significantly higher
stellar-origin BH masses (30-80 Msun) than previously estimated for sub-solar
compositions. We combine these findings to estimate the probability of
detecting gravitational waves (GWs) arising from the inspiral of double compact

boosts the formation of double compact object binaries with at least one BH. In
particular, we find the GW detection rate is increased by a factor of 20 if the

largest instruments to NS-NS binary inspirals (VIRGO: 9 Mpc; LIGO: 18) is not
high enough to ensure a first detection. However, our results indicate that if
a future instrument increased the sensitivity to 50-100 Mpc, a detection of GWs
would be expected within the first year of observation. It was previously

with fundamental flavors both at zero and non-zero temperatures. The gravity
dual at zero temperature captures the logarithmic runnings of the coupling
constants at far IR and the almost conformal, albeit strongly coupled, behavior
at the UV. The full UV completion of gauge theory is accomplished in the
gravity side by attaching an AdS cap to the IR geometry described in our
previous work. Attaching such an AdS cap is highly non-trivial because it
amounts to finding the right interpolating geometry and sources that take us
from a gravity solution with non-zero three-form fluxes to another one that has
almost vanishing three-form fluxes. In this paper we give a concrete
realisation of such a scenario, completing the program advocated in our earlier
paper. One of the main advantage of having such a background, in addition to
providing a dual description of the required gauge theory, is the absence of
Landau poles and consequently the UV divergences of the Wilson loops. The
potential for the heaviest fundamental quark anti-quark pairs, which are like
the heavy quarkonium states in realistic QCD, can be computed and their linear
behavior at large separations and zero temperature could be demonstrated. At
small separations the expected Coulombic behavior appears to dominate. On the
other hand, at non-zero temperatures interesting properties like heavy
quarkonium type suppressions and melting are shown to emerge from our gravity
dual. We provide some discussions of the melting temperature and compare our
results with the Charmonium spectrum and lattice simulations. We argue that, in
spite of the large N nature of our construction, certain model-independent

estimate for the internal extinction in the source using the Balmer decrement
from SDSS spectroscopy. We estimate the ages of the knots by comparing our
extinction-corrected photometry with stellar population synthesis models. We
find the four knots cospatial with the dusty disk to be young, of order 10^7 yr
old. The FUV emission in the nucleus is likely due to an episode of star
formation triggered ~10^9 yr ago. We argue that the young 10^7 yr old knots
stem from an episode of star formation that was roughly coeval with the event
resulting in reignition of radio activity, creating the CSS source. The 10^9 yr
old stars in the nucleus may be associated with the previous epoch of activity
that generated the 4 Mpc relic source, before it was cut off by exhaustion or
interruption. The ages of the knots, considered in context with the disturbed
morphology of the nuclear dust and the double-double morphology of the ""old""

connection. We suggest that the AGN fuel supply was interrupted for ~10^7 yr

non-steady flow of gas toward the nucleus is likely responsible for both the

the fragment or drive it into an orbit with a perigee allowing atmospheric

possible inverse correlation with mean volume density, contrary to some

for a class of Hamiltonian models. In these models of coupled matter-energy
transport, particles exchange energy through collisions with pinned-down
rotating disks. In [Commun. Math. Phys. 262 (2006)], Eckmann and Young studied
1D chains and showed that certain simple formulas give excellent approximations
of energy and particle density profiles.
  Keeping the basic mode of interaction in [Eckmann-Young], we extend their
prediction scheme to a number of new settings: 2D systems on different
lattices, driven by a variety of boundary (heat bath) conditions including the
use of thermostats. Particle-conserving models of the same type are shown to
behave similarly. The second half of this paper examines memory and finite-size
effects, which appear to impact only minimally the profiles of the models
tested in [Eckmann-Young]. We demonstrate that these effects can be significant
or insignificant depending on the local geometry. Dynamical mechanisms are
proposed, and in the case of directional bias in particle trajectories due to
memory, correction schemes are derived and shown to give accurate predictions.

We
demonstrate this through a spring network model on a square lattice. Two
different types of sites (A and B) are distributed randomly on the lattice,
representing two different constituents. There are springs of three types
connecting them (A-A, B-B and A-B). We assign two spring parameters for each
type of spring. these are a spring constant and a breaking threshold. Here we
show that intermediate compositions may require higher energy to induce the
first sample-spanning break than either pure A or pure B. So the breaking
energy goes through a maximum as the concentration of one component varies from
0 to 100%. The position and height of the peak depend on the spring parameters.
Moreover, certain combinations of spring parameters can produce composites,
which do not break upto a specified strain limit. Thus a fracture 'percolation
threshold' may be defined.

independently found that every tight extension is isometrically embedded into a
certain metrized polyhedral complex associated with $(S,\mu)$, called the tight
span. This paper develops an analogous theory for directed metrics, which are
""not necessarily symmetric"" distance functions satisfying the triangle
inequality. We introduce a directed version of the tight span and show that it
has such a universal embedding property for tight extensions. Also we newly
introduce another natural class of extensions, called cyclically tight
extensions, and show that (a fiber of) the tropical polytope, introduced by
Develin and Sturmfels, has a universal embedding property for cyclically tight
extensions. As an application, we prove the following directed version of tree
metric theorem: directed metric $\mu$ is a directed tree metric if and only if
the tropical rank of $-\mu$ is at most two. Also we describe how tight spans

Adjacent to these continental and undersea mountain ranges are layers of silt

replicas of these ridge systems. These esker and drumlin swarms run up hills
and across streams in roughly parallel discontinuous strands for hundreds of
kilometers. Preserved by encapsulation in the ice and snow of our last ice age,
eskers, drumlins and their related structures will be the focus of this paper.
We contend that Greater and lesser ridge systems alike, including the water and
sediments that fill them are cometary debris. Each ridge may be traced to a
single stream, or 'jet' of disintegrating materials emanating from shifting
areas on a comet's nucleus. A band of these jets, captured into planetary
orbit, will land its debris in a unique manner. All debris will be laid down in
a sheet perpendicular to the planetary surface, this process which results in
the sharp ridge profile, is consistent with the manner in which comets
discharge debris along the plane of their orbit. The jet particles, massive
enough to resist planetary atmosphere [sands, gravel and boulders] once landed
become robust structures through compacting and immediate concretization. The
water and lighter materials, diverted by winds and post-depositional melting,
flowed and settled into the inter-ridge basins. The establishment of the ridge
complexes found on earth is therefore consistent with its initial encounter
with a great comet. The ancestral body's return in reduced and fragmented form
laid down the lesser esker and drumlin formations.

star, with an observed equivalent width of 1.4+-0.3 Angstroms, perhaps
associated to chromospheric activity. Subtracting a K-type template star and
correcting for the veiling of the accretion disk yields to an equivalent width
of 2.8+-0.3 Angstroms. A bright hot-spot is also detected at the position where
the gas stream trajectory intercepts with the accretion disk. The H$\alpha$
flux associated to the secondary star is too large to be powered by X-ray

orbital periods and, therefore, is probably triggered by the rapid stellar

(DF) with given marginal distributions and correlation coefficient. We
introduce a convenient mathematical tool, called a copula, to connect two DFs
with any prescribed dependence structure. If the correlation of two variables
is weak (Pearson's correlation coefficient $|\rho| <1/3 $), the
Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) copula provides an intuitive and natural way
for constructing such a bivariate DF. When the linear correlation is stronger,
the FGM copula cannot work anymore. In this case, we propose to use a Gaussian
copula, which connects two given marginals and directly related to the linear
correlation coefficient between two variables. Using the copulas, we
constructed the BLFs and discuss its statistical properties. Especially, we
focused on the FUV--FIR BLF, since these two luminosities are related to the
star formation (SF) activity. Though both the FUV and FIR are related to the SF
activity, the univariate LFs have a very different functional form: former is
well described by the Schechter function whilst the latter has a much more
extended power-law like luminous end. We constructed the FUV-FIR BLFs by the
FGM and Gaussian copulas with different strength of correlation, and examined
their statistical properties. Then, we discuss some further possible
applications of the BLF: the problem of a multiband flux-limited sample
selection, the construction of the SF rate (SFR) function, and the construction
of the stellar mass of galaxies ($M_*$)--specific SFR ($SFR/M_*$) relation. The
copulas turned out to be a very useful tool to investigate all these issues,

interpolation problems admits a Redheffer linear-fractional parametrization.
The method of unitary coupling identifies solutions of the lifting problem with
minimal unitary extensions of a partially defined isometry constructed
explicitly from the problem data. A special role is played by a particular
unitary extension, called the central or universal unitary extension. The
coefficient matrix for the Redheffer linear-fractional map has a simple
expression in terms of the universal unitary extension. The universal unitary
extension can be seen as a unitary coupling of four unitary operators (two
bilateral shift operators together with two unitary operators coming from the
problem data) which has special geometric structure. We use this special
geometric structure to obtain an inverse theorem (Theorem 8.4 as well as
Theorem 9.3) which characterizes the coefficient matrices for a Redheffer
linear-fractional map arising in this way from a lifting problem. When
expressed in terms of Hellinger-space functional models (Theorem 10.3), these
results lead to generalizations of classical results of Arov and to
characterizations of the coefficient matrix-measures of the lifting problem in
terms of the density properties of the corresponding model spaces. The main
tool is the formalism of unitary scattering systems developed in [18], [45].

Ashry","On applications of Ulam-Hyers stability in biology and economics","6 pages, 0 figures",,,,"nlin.CD q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We argue that Ulam-Hyers stability concept is quite significant in realistic
problems in numerical analysis, biology and economics. A generalization to
nonlinear systems is proposed and applied to the logistic equation (both
differential and difference), SIS epidemic model, Cournot model in economics
and a reaction diffusion equation. To the best of our knowledge this is the
first time Ulam-Hyers stability is considered from the applications point of
view.
