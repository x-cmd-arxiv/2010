hard process in {\em pp} interactions at the LHC is presented. Within the
$S^1/Z_2$ TeV$^{-1}$ extra dimensional theoretical framework with the focus on
the KK excitations of the Standard Model $\gamma$ and $Z^0$ gauge bosons, the
hard-process, $f\bar f \to \sum_n\left(\gamma^*/Z^*\right)_n \to F \bar F$, has
been used where $f$ is the initial state parton, $F$ the final state lepton and
$\left(\gamma^*/Z^*\right)_{n}$ is the $n^{\rm th}$ KK excitation of the
$\gamma/Z^0$ boson. For this study the analytic form for the hard process cross
section has been independently calculated by the authors and has been
implemented using the {\sc Moses} framework. The Moses framework itself, that
has been written by the authors, was used as an external process within the
{\sc Pythia} Monte Carlo generator which provides the phase space generation
for the final state leptons and partons from the initial state hadrons, and the
simulation of initial and final state radiation and hadronization. A brief
discussion of the possibility for observing and identifying the unique
signature of the KK signal given the current LHC program is also presented.

  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The multiuser communication channel, in which multiple users exchange
information with the help of a relay terminal, termed the multi-way relay
channel (mRC), is introduced. In this model, multiple interfering clusters of
users communicate simultaneously, where the users within the same cluster wish
to exchange messages among themselves. It is assumed that the users cannot
receive each other's signals directly, and hence the relay terminal in this
model is the enabler of communication. In particular, restricted encoders,
which ignore the received channel output and use only the corresponding
messages for generating the channel input, are considered. Achievable rate
regions and an outer bound are characterized for the Gaussian mRC, and their
comparison is presented in terms of exchange rates in a symmetric Gaussian
network scenario. It is shown that the compress-and-forward (CF) protocol
achieves exchange rates within a constant bit offset of the exchange capacity
independent of the power constraints of the terminals in the network. A finite
bit gap between the exchange rates achieved by the CF and the
amplify-and-forward (AF) protocols is also shown. The two special cases of the
mRC, the full data exchange model, in which every user wants to receive
messages of all other users, and the pairwise data exchange model which
consists of multiple two-way relay channels, are investigated in detail. In
particular for the pairwise data exchange model, in addition to the proposed
random coding based achievable schemes, a nested lattice coding based scheme is
also presented and is shown to achieve exchange rates within a constant bit gap
of the exchange capacity.

with light. A prominent example is electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) where the transmission of a probe beam through an optically dense medium
is manipulated by means of a control beam. Scaling such experiments into the
quantum domain with one, or just a few particles of both light and matter will
allow for the implementation of quantum computing protocols with atoms and
photons or the realisation of strongly interacting photon gases exhibiting
quantum phase transitions of light. Reaching these aims is challenging and
requires an enhanced matter-light interaction as provided by cavity quantum
electrodynamics (QED). Here we demonstrate EIT with a single atom
quasi-permanently trapped inside a high-finesse optical cavity. The atom acts
as a quantum-optical transistor with the ability to coherently control the
transmission of light through the cavity. We furthermore investigate the
scaling of EIT when the atom number is increased one by one. The measured
spectra are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model. Merging EIT with
cavity QED and single quanta of matter is likely to become the cornerstone for
novel applications, e.g. the dynamic control of the photon statistics of
propagating light fields or the engineering of Fock-state superpositions of
flying light pulses.

the sensitive Spitzer infrared images (at wavelengths from 3.6 to 70 um), and
has weak (sub-)millimeter dust continuum emission. Consequently, this source
has an extremely low bolometric luminosity (< 0.1 L_sun). Infrared and
(sub-)millimeter observations clearly show an outflow emanating from this
source; L1448 IRS2E represents thus far the lowest luminosity source known to
be driving a molecular outflow. Comparisons with prestellar cores and Class 0
protostars suggest that L1448 IRS2E is more evolved than prestellar cores but
less evolved than Class 0 protostars, i.e., at a stage intermediate between
prestellar cores and Class 0 protostars. All these results are consistent with
the theoretical predictions of the radiative/magneto hydrodynamical
simulations, making L1448 IRS2E the most promising candidate of the first
hydrostatic core revealed so far.

the outgoing waves coincide with the corresponding coefficients of the linear

represents an extension of their work to the case of graphs and, as a
byproduct, it shows how to extend the analysis of soliton scattering by other
point interactions on the line, interpreted as a degenerate graph.

us to construct tractable toy models for fluid mechanics with a finite number
of degrees of freedom. We solve one of them to show how symmetries can be

Epidemics have often originated in rural areas, with rural communities among
the first affected. Disease dynamics in rural regions have received limited
attention, and results of general studies cannot be directly applied since
population densities and human mobility factors are very different in rural
regions from those in cities. We create a network model of a rural community in
Kansas, USA, by collecting data on the contact patterns and computing rates of
contact among a sampled population. We model the impact of different mitigation
strategies detecting closely connected groups of people and frequently visited
locations. Within those groups and locations, we compare the effectiveness of
random and targeted vaccinations using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered
compartmental model on the contact network. Our simulations show that the
targeted vaccinations of only 10% of the sampled population reduced the size of
the epidemic by 34.5%. Additionally, if 10% of the population visiting one of
the most popular locations is randomly vaccinated, the epidemic size is reduced
by 19%. Our results suggest a new implementation of a highly effective strategy
for targeted vaccinations through the use of popular locations in rural
communities.

as predicted by numerical simulations of star formation initiated by converging

resolved into multiple condensations. MM1 and MM2 have markedly different
temperatures, continuum spectral indices, molecular-line spectra, and masses of
both stars and gas. (3) The dynamics of the ""hot-core"" MM1 indicates the
presence of a rotating disk in its center (MM1-Main) around a faint free-free

applications such as voice and text recognition, image analysis, computer

given an i.i.d. training set $(X_{1},Y_{1}),... (X_{n},Y_{n})$ where $X_{i}$
represents a feature and $Y_{i}\in \{0,1\}$ is a label attached to that
feature. The underlying joint distribution of $(X,Y)$ is unknown, but we can
learn about it from the training set and we aim at devising low error
classifiers $f:X\to Y$ used to predict the label of new incoming features.
  Here we solve a quantum analogue of this problem, namely the classification
of two arbitrary unknown qubit states. Given a number of `training' copies from
each of the states, we would like to `learn' about them by performing a
measurement on the training set. The outcome is then used to design mesurements
for the classification of future systems with unknown labels. We find the
asymptotically optimal classification strategy and show that typically, it
performs strictly better than a plug-in strategy based on state estimation.
  The figure of merit is the excess risk which is the difference between the
probability of error and the probability of error of the optimal measurement
when the states are known, that is the Helstrom measurement. We show that the
excess risk has rate $n^{-1}$ and compute the exact constant of the rate.

themselves are replaced by suitable categories of sheaves; another in which the
gauge groups are categorified to higher groupoids. Together with their gauge
groups, also the fiber bundles themselves become categorified, and their gluing
(or descent data) is given by nonabelian cocycles, generalizing group
cohomology, where infinity-groupoids appear in the role both of the domain and

Methods: Using the VLBA and the EVN arrays, we conducted phase-referenced

22.2 GHz (4 epochs), CH3OH at 6.7 GHz (3 epochs), and OH at 1.665 GHz (1

0.1 mJy) VLA observations of the radio continuum emission from the star-forming
region at 1.3 and 3.6 cm. Results: This is the first work to report accurate
measurements of the ""relative"" proper motions of the 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers. The
different spatial and 3-D velocity distribution clearly indicate that the 22
GHz water and 6.7 GHz methanol masers are tracing different kinematic
environments. The bipolar distribution of 6.7 GHz maser l.o.s. velocities and
the regular pattern of observed proper motions suggest that these masers are
tracing rotation around a central mass of about 35 solar masses. The flattened
spatial distribution of the 6.7 GHz masers, oriented NW-SE, suggests that they
can originate in a disk/toroid rotating around the massive YSO which drives the
12CO(2-1) outflow, oriented NE-SW, observed on arcsec scale. The extended,
radio continuum source observed close to the 6.7 GHz masers could be excited by
a wide-angle wind emitted from the YSO associated with the methanol masers, and
such a wind is proven to be sufficiently energetic to drive the NE-SW 12CO(2-1)
outflow. The H2O masers distribute across a region offset about 0"".5 to the NW
of the CH3OH masers, in the same area where emission of high-density molecular
tracers, typical of HMCs, was detected. We postulate that a distinct YSO,
possibly in an earlier evolutionary phase than that exciting the methanol
masers, is responsible for the excitation of the water masers and the HMC
molecular lines. (Abridged)

generally far from optimal in networks as simple as MIMO multiaccess channels

used except for the sum-rate optimization. This is changed by the polite
water-filling that is optimal for all boundary points of the capacity regions
of MAC and BC and for all boundary points of a set of achievable regions of a
more general class of MIMO B-MAC interference networks, which is a combination
of multiple interfering broadcast channels, from the transmitter point of view,
and multiaccess channels, from the receiver point of view, including MAC, BC,
interference channels, X networks, and most practical wireless networks as
special case. It is polite because it strikes an optimal balance between
reducing interference to others and maximizing a link's own rate. Employing it,
the related optimizations can be vastly simplified by taking advantage of the
structure of the problems. Deeply connected to the polite water-filling, the
rate duality is extended to the forward and reverse links of the B-MAC
networks. As a demonstration, weighted sum-rate maximization algorithms based
on polite water-filling and duality with superior performance and low

scales. Why is the spacetime on large scales modeled to a good approximation by
the Friedmann equations? Are we sure that small-scale non-linearities do not
induce a large backreaction? Related to this, what is the effective theory that
describes the universe on large scales? In this paper we make progress in
addressing these questions. We show that the effective theory for the
long-wavelength universe behaves as a viscous fluid coupled to gravity:
integrating out short-wavelength perturbations renormalizes the homogeneous
background and introduces dissipative dynamics into the evolution of
long-wavelength perturbations. The effective fluid has small perturbations and
is characterized by a few parameters like an equation of state, a sound speed
and a viscosity parameter. These parameters can be matched to numerical
simulations or fitted from observations. We find that the backreaction of
small-scale non-linearities is very small, being suppressed by the large
hierarchy between the scale of non-linearities and the horizon scale. The
effective pressure of the fluid is always positive and much too small to
significantly affect the background evolution. Moreover, we prove that
virialized scales decouple completely from the large-scale dynamics, at all
orders in the post-Newtonian expansion. We propose that our effective theory be
used to formulate a well-defined and controlled alternative to conventional
perturbation theory, and we discuss possible observational applications.
Finally, our way of reformulating results in second-order perturbation theory
in terms of a long-wavelength effective fluid provides the opportunity to
understand non-linear effects in a simple and physically intuitive way.

hard jets, leptons, or photons, while the backgrounds often have additional
jets. In such cases vetoing undesired additional jets is an effective way to
discriminate signals and background. Given an inclusive event sample with N or
more jets, the veto to have only N energetic jets defines an ""exclusive"" N-jet
cross section. This strongly restricts the phase space of the underlying
inclusive N-jet cross section and causes large double logarithms in
perturbation theory that must be summed to obtain theory predictions. Jet
vetoes are typically implemented using jet algorithms. This yields complicated
phase-space restrictions and one often relies on parton-shower Monte Carlos,
which are limited to leading-logarithmic accuracy. We introduce a global event

vanishes in the limit of exactly N infinitely narrow jets. Requiring tau_N << 1
constrains radiation between the N signal jets and vetoes additional undesired

generation of galaxies that initiated the reionization process in our Universe.
The Lyman Alpha (Lya) emission line is robustly predicted to be the most
prominent intrinsic spectral feature of these galaxies, making it an ideal
target to search for and study high redshift galaxies. Unfortunately the large
Gunn-Peterson optical depth of the surrounding neutral intergalactic medium
(IGM) is thought to render this line extremely difficult to detect prior to
reionization. In this paper we demonstrate that the radiative transfer effects
in the interstellar medium (ISM), which cause Lya flux to emerge from galaxies
at frequencies where the Gunn-Peterson optical depth is reduced, can
substantially enhance the prospects for detection of the Lya line at high
redshift. In particular, scattering off outflows of interstellar HI gas can
modify the Lya spectral line shape such that >5% of the emitted Lya radiation
is transmitted directly to the observer, even through a fully neutral IGM. It
may therefore be possible to directly observe `strong' Lya emission lines (EW >
50 Angstrom rest frame) from the highest redshift galaxies that reside in the
smallest HII `bubbles' early in the reionization era with JWST. In addition, we
show that outflows can boost the fraction of Lya radiation that is transmitted
through the IGM during the latter stages of reionization, and even
post-reionization. Coupled with the fact that the first generation of galaxies
are thought to have very large intrinsic equivalent Lya equivalent widths, our
results suggest that the search for galaxies in their redshifted Lya emission
line can be competitive with the drop-out technique out to the highest
redshifts that can be probed in the JWST era.

respect to the observed symmetry axes of foreground galaxies with redshifts zl
~ 0.3, the signature of anisotropic galaxy-galaxy lensing differs substantially
from the expectation that one would have in the absence of multiple
deflections. The observed ratio of the mean tangential shears, g+/g-, is
strongly suppressed compared to the function that one would measure if the
intrinsic symmetry axes of the foreground galaxies were known. Depending upon
the characteristic masses of the lenses, the observed ratio of the mean
tangential shears may be consistent with an isotropic signal (despite the fact
that the lenses are non-spherical), or it may even be reversed from the
expected signal (i.e., the mean tangential shear for sources close to the
observed minor axes of the lenses may exceed the mean tangential shear for
sources close to the observed major axes of the lenses). These effects are
caused primarily by the fact that the lens galaxies have, themselves, been
lensed and therefore the observed symmetry axes of the lenses differ from their
intrinsic symmetry axes. The effects of lensing of the foreground galaxies on
the observed function g+/g- cannot be eliminated by the rejection of foreground
galaxies with small image ellipticities, nor by focusing the analysis on
sources that are located very close to the observed symmetry axes of the
foreground galaxies. We conclude that any attempt to use a measurement of g+/g-

the stellar surface. The first light, typically a UV or X-ray flash, is
followed by a broken power-law decay of the luminosity generated by radiation
that leaks out of the expanding gas sphere. Motivated by recent detection of
emission from very early stages of several SNe, we revisit the theory of shock
breakout and the following emission. We derive analytic light curves, paying
special attention to the photon-gas coupling and deviations from thermal
equilibrium. We then consider the breakout from several SNe progenitors. We
find that for more compact progenitors, white dwarfs, Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs)
and possibly more energetic blue-supergiant explosions, the observed radiation
is out of thermal equilibrium at the breakout, during the planar phase (i.e.,
before the expanding gas doubles its radius), and during the early spherical
phase. Therefore, during these phases we predict significantly higher
temperatures than previous analysis that assumed equilibrium. When thermal
equilibrium prevails, we find the location of the thermalization depth and its
temporal evolution. Our results are useful for interpretation of early SN light
curves. Some examples are: (i) Red supergiant SNe have an early bright peak in
optical and UV flux, less than an hour after breakout. It is followed by a
minimum at the end of the planar phase (about 10 hr), before it peaks again
once the temperature drops to the observed frequency range. In contrast WRs
show only the latter peak in optical and UV. (ii) Bright X-ray flares are
expected from all core-collapse SNe types. (iii) The light curve and spectrum
of the initial breakout pulse holds information on the explosion geometry and
progenitor wind opacity. Its spectrum in compact progenitors shows a
(non-thermal) power-law.

spectroscopically-confirmed Coma member galaxies that range from giant spirals
and elliptical galaxies to dwarf irregular and early-type galaxies. The full

NUV=23 and FUV=23.5, and has a limiting depth at NUV=24.5 and FUV=25.0 which
corresponds to a star formation rate of ~0.001 Msun/yr at the distance of Coma.
Our deep GALEX observations required a two-fold approach to generating a source
catalog: we used a Bayesian deblending algorithm to measure faint and compact
sources (using SDSS coordinates as a position prior), and relied on the GALEX
pipeline catalog for bright/extended objects. We performed simulations to
assess the influence that systematic effects (e.g. object blends, source
confusion, Eddington Bias) have on source detection and photometry when using
both methods. The Bayesian deblending method roughly doubles the number of
source detections and provides reliable photometry to a few magnitudes deeper
than the GALEX pipeline catalog. This method is also free from source confusion
over the UV magnitude range studied here; conversely, we estimate that the
GALEX pipeline catalogs are confusion limited at magnitudes fainter than NUV~23
and FUV~24. We have measured the total UV galaxy counts using our catalog and
report a ~50% excess of counts across FUV=22-23.5 and NUV=21.5-23 relative to
previous GALEX measurements, which is not attributed to cluster member
galaxies. Our galaxy counts are a better match to deeper UV counts measured

remedies the causal pathology in the form of closed time-like curves which is
allowed in general relativity. We derive an expression for a critical radius
$r_c$ (beyond which the causality is violated) for an arbitrary Palatini f(R)

Units (GPU) architecture using CUDA + MPI, resulting in an overall acceleration
(x80) that allows us to tackle radiative transfer problems at resolution of

RT cartesian grid. We observe a good convergence between our different
resolution runs as long as the effects of finite resolution on the star
formation history are properly taken into account. We also show that the
neutral fraction depends on the total mass density, in a way close to the
predictions of photoionization equilibrium, as long as the effect of
self-shielding is included in the background radiation model. However we still
fail at reproducing the z=6 constraints on the H neutral fraction and the
intensity of the UV background. In order to account for unresolved density
fluctuations, we added a simple clumping factor model. Using our most spatially
resolved simulation (12.5 Mpc/h-1024^3) to calibrate our subgrid model, we have
resimulated our largest box (100 Mpc/h 1024^3), successfully reproducing the
observed level of H neutral fraction at z=6. We don't reproduce the
photoionization rate inferred from the same observations. We argue that this
discrepancy could be explained by the fact that the average radiation intensity

density distribution, so that one quantity cannot be simply deduced from the

magnetoelectric effect quantized in units of the fine structure constant
$\alpha=e^2/\hbar c$. In this work, we propose an optical experiment to
directly measure this topological quantization phenomenon, independent of
material details. Our proposal also provides a way to measure the
half-quantized Hall conductances on the two surfaces of the topological
insulator independently of each other.

variables, the most widely utilized, interaction information, suffers from the
problem that it is sometimes negative. Here we reconsider from first principles
the general structure of the information that a set of sources provides about a
given variable. We begin with a new definition of redundancy as the minimum
information that any source provides about each possible outcome of the
variable, averaged over all possible outcomes. We then show how this measure of
redundancy induces a lattice over sets of sources that clarifies the general
structure of multivariate information. Finally, we use this redundancy lattice
to propose a definition of partial information atoms that exhaustively
decompose the Shannon information in a multivariate system in terms of the
redundancy between synergies of subsets of the sources. Unlike interaction
information, the atoms of our partial information decomposition are never
negative and always support a clear interpretation as informational quantities.
Our analysis also demonstrates how the negativity of interaction information
can be explained by its confounding of redundancy and synergy.

observed galaxy population but we remain unsure of their detailed interactions.
The semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation uses multi-dimensional
parameterisations of the physical processes of galaxy formation and provides a
tool to constrain these underlying physical interactions. Because of the high
dimensionality, the parametric problem of galaxy formation may be profitably
tackled with a Bayesian-inference based approach, which allows one to constrain
theory with data in a statistically rigorous way. In this paper we develop a
SAM in the framework of Bayesian inference. We show that, with a parallel
implementation of an advanced Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm, it is now
possible to rigorously sample the posterior distribution of the
high-dimensional parameter space of typical SAMs. As an example, we
characterise galaxy formation in the current $\Lambda$CDM cosmology using the
stellar mass function of galaxies as an observational constraint. We find that
the posterior probability distribution is both topologically complex and
degenerate in some important model parameters, suggesting that thorough
explorations of the parameter space are needed to understand the models. We
also demonstrate that because of the model degeneracy, adopting a narrow prior
strongly restricts the model. Therefore, the inferences based on SAMs are
conditional to the model adopted. Using synthetic data to mimic systematic
errors in the stellar mass function, we demonstrate that an accurate
observational error model is essential to meaningful inference.

least-favorable model is constructed and used to evaluate the performance of
alternative filters. Simulations comparing the proposed risk-sensitive filter

systems. In particular, MUDiv allows for scheduling among users in order to
eliminate the negative effects of unfavorable channel fading conditions of some
users on the system performance. Scheduling, however, consumes energy (e.g.,
for making users' channel state information available to the scheduler). This
extra usage of energy, which could potentially be used for data transmission,
can be very wasteful, especially if the number of users is large. In this
paper, we answer the question of how much MUDiv is required for energy limited
MU systems. Focusing on uplink MU wireless systems, we develop MU scheduling
algorithms which aim at maximizing the MUDiv gain. Toward this end, we
introduce a new realistic energy model which accounts for scheduling energy and
describes the distribution of the total energy between scheduling and data
transmission stages. Using the fact that such energy distribution can be
controlled by varying the number of active users, we optimize this number by
either (i) minimizing the overall system bit error rate (BER) for a fixed total
energy of all users in the system or (ii) minimizing the total energy of all
users for fixed BER requirements. We find that for a fixed number of available
users, the achievable MUDiv gain can be improved by activating only a subset of
users. Using asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations, we show that our
approach benefits from MUDiv gains higher than that achievable by generic
greedy access algorithm, which is the optimal scheduling method for energy
unlimited systems.

which allows for a self-consistent procedure of the GQME generator. This
approach is approximate but properly reproduces the nonequilibrium steady state
density matrix and the currents of an exactly solvable model. The approach is
less accurate for higher moments such as the noise.

information on the magnetic field that pervades the Interstellar Medium of the
Galaxy. Despite the acknowledged importance of the magnetic field in
interstellar processes, our knowledge of field configurations on all scales is
seriously limited. Aims: This paper describes an extensive survey of polarized
Galactic emission at 1.4 GHz that provides data with arcminute resolution and
complete coverage of all structures from the broadest angular scales to the
resolution limit, giving information on the magneto-ionic medium over a wide
range of interstellar environments. Methods: Data from the DRAO Synthesis
Telescope, the Effelsberg 100-m Telescope, and the DRAO 26-m Telescope have
been combined. Angular resolution is ~1' and the survey extends from l = 66 deg
to l = 175 deg over a range -3 deg < b < 5 deg along the northern Galactic
plane, with a high-latitude extension from l = 101 deg to l = 116 deg up to b =
17.5 deg. This is the first extensive polarization survey to present
aperture-synthesis data combined with data from single antennas, and the
techniques developed to achieve this combination are described. Results: The
appearance of the extended polarized emission at 1.4 GHz is dominated by
Faraday rotation along the propagation path, and the diffuse polarized sky
bears little resemblance to the total-intensity sky. There is extensive
depolarization, arising from vector averaging on long lines of sight, from HII
regions, and from diffuse ionized gas seen in H-alpha images. Preliminary
interpretation is presented of selected polarization features on scales from
parsecs (the planetary nebula Sh 2-216) to hundreds of parsecs (a supperbubble
GSH 166-01-17) to kiloparsecs (polarized emission in the direction of Cygnus
X).

tractable, at least for asymptotically large imaginary parts of the QNFs. We
shall derive an appropriate ""quantization condition"" for the asymptotic QNFs,
and extract as much analytic information as possible. In particular, we shall
explicitly verify that the (offset)+ i n (gap) behaviour is common but not
universal, with this behaviour failing unless the ratio of rates of exponential
falloff on the two sides of the potential is a rational number. (This is
""common but not universal"" in the sense that the rational numbers are dense in
the reals.) We argue that this behaviour is likely to persist for black holes

and BD formation processes, we study and compare the disk fraction among both

we examine the spatial distribution of stars and BD relative to the underlying
molecular gas Methods. In this paper, we present new and updated photometry

We find that the disk fraction among BDs in the Taurus cloud is 41 \pm 12%, a
value statistically consistent with the one among TTS (58 \pm 9%). We find that
BDs in transition from a state where they have a disk to a diskless state are
rare, and we study one isolated example of a transitional disk with an inner

  Network",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) is an effective technique for reliable
transmission of packets in wireless networks. In ARQ, however, only a few
erroneous bits in a packet will cause the entire packet to be discarded at the
receiver. In this case, it's wasteful to retransmit the correct bit in the
received packet. The partial packet recovery only retransmits the unreliable
decoded bits in order to increase the throughput of network. In addition, the
cooperative transmission based on Interleave-division multiple-access (IDMA)
can obtain diversity gains with multiple relays with different locations for
multiple sources simultaneously. By exploring the diversity from the channel
between relay and destination, we propose a relay-assisted partial packet
recovery in CDMA wireless network to improve the performance of throughput. In
the proposed scheme, asynchronous IDMA iterative chip-by-chip multiuser
detection is utilized as a method of multiple partial recovery, which can be a
complementarity in a current CDMA network. The confidence values' concept is
applied to detect unreliable decoded bits. According to the result of
unreliable decoded bits' position, we use a recursive algorithm based on cost
evaluation to decide a feedback strategy. Then the feedback request with
minimum cost can be obtained. The simulation results show that the performance
of throughput can be significantly improved with our scheme, compared with
traditional ARQ scheme. The upper bound with our scheme is provided in our
simulation. Moreover, we show how relays' location affects the performance.

Monte Carlo (MCMC), ABC and a Bayesian bootstrap procedure was developed in a
truly distribution-free setting. The ABC methodology arises because we work in
a distribution-free setting in which we make no parametric assumptions, meaning
we can not evaluate the likelihood point-wise or in this case simulate directly
from the likelihood model. The use of a bootstrap procedure allows us to
generate samples from the intractable likelihood without the requirement of
distributional assumptions, this is crucial to the ABC framework. The developed
methodology is used to obtain the empirical distribution of the DFCL model
parameters and the predictive distribution of the outstanding loss liabilities

metal-rich than Lindsay38 and its spread in metallicity appears modest. We also
find that the synthetic CMD constructed assuming a metallicity spread of 0.5
dex for intermediate-age stars predicts evolutionary features not supported by

important role in understanding strongly correlated systems, such as the
emergence of fermions, anyons, and gauge theory in quantum spin liquids and
quantum Hall states. Recently, fermionic Projected Entangled Pair States
(fPEPS) have been introduced to effciently represent many-body fermionic
states. In this paper, we show that the strongly correlated bosonic/fermionic
states obtained both from the projective construction and the fPEPS approach
can be represented systematically as Grassmann tensor product states. This
construction can also be applied to all other tensor network states approaches.
The Grassmann tensor product states allow us to encode many-body
bosonic/fermionic states effciently with a polynomial number of parameters. We
also generalize the tensor-entanglement renormalization group (TERG) method for
complex tensor networks to Grassmann tensor networks. This allows us to
approximate the norm and average local operators of Grassmann tensor product
states in polynomial time, and hence leads to a variational approach for
describing strongly correlated bosonic/fermionic systems in higher dimensions.

lays down on a local frame 2 plane along the filaments embedded in a 3D plasma.
Curvature effects plays the role of folding in fast magnetic dynamos. In the

oscillatory, purely imaginary, branches of the spectrum are found in dynamo

model with indivisible goods and unit-demand buyers, with budget constraints:
buyers can specify a maximum price they are willing to pay for each item,
beyond which they cannot afford the item. This single discontinuity introduced
by the budget constraint fundamentally changes the properties of equilibria: in
the assignment model without budget constraints, a competitive equilibrium
always exists, and corresponds exactly to a stable matching. With budgets, a
competitive equilibrium need not always exist. In addition, there are now two
distinct notions of stability, depending on whether both or only one of the
buyer and seller can strictly benefit in a blocking pair, that no longer
coincide due to the budget-induced discontinuity. We define weak and strong
stability for the assignment model with transferable utilities, and show that
competitive equilibria correspond exactly to strongly stable matchings.
  We consider the algorithmic question of efficiently computing competitive
equilibria in an extension of the assignment model with budgets, where each
buyer specifies his preferences over items using utility functions $u_{ij}$,
where $u_{ij}(p_j)$ is the utility of buyer $i$ for item $j$ when its price is
$p_j$. Our main result is a strongly polynomial time algorithm that decides
whether or not a competitive equilibrium exists and if yes, computes a minimum
one, for a general class of utility functions $u_{ij}$. This class of utility
functions includes the standard quasi-linear utility model with a budget
constraint, and in addition, allows modeling marketplaces where, for example,
buyers only have a preference ranking amongst items subject to a maximum
payment limit for each item, or where buyers want to optimize return on
investment (ROI) instead of a quasi-linear utility and only know items'

in a wide range of energy and momentum reproduce various anomalous properties
observed in experiments for the high-Tc cuprates. Our results reveal that the
pseudogap in hole-doped cuprates has a d-wave-like structure only below the
Fermi level, while it retains non-d-wave structure with a fully opened gap
above the Fermi energy even in the nodal direction due to a zero surface
extending over the entire Brillouin zone. In addition to the non-d-wave
pseudogap, the present comprehensive identifications of the spectral asymmetry
as to the Fermi energy, the Fermi arc, and the back-bending behavior of the
dispersion, waterfall, and low-energy kink, in agreement with the experimental
anomalies of the cuprates, do not support that these originate from (the

quantum mechanically singular for quantum particles obeying Klein-Gordon
equation but nonsingular for fermions obeying Dirac equation. Explicit
calculations reveal that the occurrence of the timelike naked singularities in
the considered spacetimes do not violate the cosmic censorship hypothesis as
far as the Dirac fields are concerned. The role of horizons that clothes the
singularity in the black hole cases is replaced by repulsive potential barrier
against the propagation of Dirac fields.

  Principle","28 pages, 7 figures",,,"US-10-03","hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A geometric approach to some quantum statistical systems (including the
harmonic oscillator) is presented. We regard the (N+1)-dimensional Euclidean
{\it coordinate} system (X$^i$,$\tau$) as the quantum statistical system of N
quantum (statistical) variables (X$^i$) and one {\it Euclidean time} variable
($\tau$). Introducing a path (line or hypersurface) in this space
(X$^i$,$\tau$), we adopt the path-integral method to quantize the mechanical
system. This is a new view of (statistical) quantization of the {\it
mechanical} system. It is inspired by the {\it extra dimensional model},
appearing in the unified theory of forces including gravity, using the
bulk-boundary configuration. The system Hamiltonian appears as the {\it area}.
We show quantization is realized by the {\it minimal area principle} in the
present geometric approach. When we take a {\it line} as the path, the
path-integral expressions of the free energy are shown to be the ordinary ones
(such as N harmonic oscillators) or their simple variation. When we take a {\it
hyper-surface} as the path, the system Hamiltonian is given by the {\it area}
of the {\it hyper-surface} which is defined as a {\it closed-string
configuration} in the bulk space. In this case, the system becomes a O(N)
non-linear model. The two choices,\ (1) the {\it line element} in the bulk
($X^i,\tau $) and (2) the Hamiltonian(defined as the damping functional in the
path-integral) specify the system dynamics. After explaining this new approach,
we apply it to a topic in the 5 dimensional quantum gravity. We present a {\it
new standpoint} about the quantum gravity: (a)\ The metric (gravitational)
field is treated as the background (fixed) one;\ (b)\ The space-time
coordinates are not merely position-labels but are quantum (statistical)
variables by themselves. We show the recently-proposed 5 dimensional Casimir
energy is valid.

predictions at realistically low plasma temperatures (O(T_c)), experimentally
relevant low dilepton mass (O(1 GeV)) and strong coupling (alphaS=0.5-1), we
take into account not only the higher order pQCD reaction mechanisms, but also
the non-perturbative spectral functions (off-shellness) and self-energies of
the quarks, anti-quarks and gluons thus going beyond the leading twist. For
this purpose, our calculations utilize parametrizations of the non-perturbative
propagators for quarks and gluons provided by the dynamical quasi-particle
model (DQPM) matched to reproduce lattice data. The DQPM describes QCD
properties in terms of single-particle Green's functions (in the sense of a
two-particle irreducible approach) and leads to the notion of the constituents
of the sQGP being effective quasiparticles, which are massive and have broad
spectral functions (due to large interaction rates). In the present work, we
derive the off-shell cross sections of dilepton production in the reactions

does not explain some details, revealed by various microscopic methods. The
suggested alternative explanation is in a better accord with the entire
experimental evidence, including low-temperature (LT) scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) results. It is based on the existence of modulated layered
nano-domains formed below both CDW onset temperatures. According to this model,
two of the three slightly different BCTP types of columns are modulated by the
same wave vector, either q1 or q2, which can easily switch over in a domain as
a whole. This approach explains the presence of the q2 modulation in the STM
images recorded above the T2 CDW transition and the absence of the q2
satellites in the corresponding diffraction patterns. The long periodic
modulation, detected by LT STM is attributed to a beating between the two CDWs,
centered on adjacent columns of the same type. These pairs of columns, both
either of type-III or type-I, modulated by the two alternative CDWs, represent
the basic modulation units, ordered into nano-domains.

millimeter and sub-millimeter domain from 100 to 857 GHz with unprecedented
sensitivity to polarization ($\Delta P/T_{\tiny cmb} \sim 4\cdot 10^{-6}$) at
100, 143, 217 and 353 GHz. It will lead to major improvements in our
understanding of the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies and polarized
foreground signals. Planck will make high resolution measurements of the
$E$-mode spectrum (up to $\ell \sim 1500$) and will also play a prominent role
in the search for the faint imprint of primordial gravitational waves on the
CMB polarization. This paper addresses the effects of calibration of both
temperature (gain) and polarization (polarization efficiency and detector
orientation) on polarization measurements. The specific requirements on the
polarization parameters of the instrument are set and we report on their
pre-flight measurement on HFI bolometers. We present a semi-analytical method
that exactly accounts for the scanning strategy of the instrument as well as
the combination of different detectors. We use this method to propagate errors
through to the CMB angular power spectra in the particular case of Planck-HFI,
and to derive constraints on polarization parameters. We show that in order to
limit the systematic error to 10% of the cosmic variance of the $E$-mode power
spectrum, uncertainties in gain, polarization efficiency and detector
orientation must be below 0.15%, 0.3% and 1\deg\ respectively. Pre-launch
ground measurements reported in this paper already fulfill these requirements.

assignment to f(.), an improved lower bound on the capacity of DTC is obtained.
We also consider the Gaussian multiple access channel with additive
interference, and study two different scenarios for this system. In the first
case, both transmitters know interference causally while in the second, one
transmitter has access to the interference noncausally and the other causally.
Achievable rate regions for these two scenarios are then established.

locally finite time substitution (ULFTS)} for the group $\mathbb Z$ (and for
all amenable groups). Two automorphisms which have the same orbit partitions

variety of astrophysical scenarios because anisotropic plasma structures are
ubiquitous in space. The Weibel instability is driven by a temperature
anisotropy which is commonly modeled by a bi-axis distribution function, such
as a bi-Maxwellian or a generalized bi-Kappa. Previous studies have been
limited to a bi-Kappa distribution and found a suppression of this instability
in the presence of suprathermal tails. In the present paper it is shown that
the Weibel growth rate is rather more sensitive to the shape of the anisotropic
distribution function. In order to illustrate the distinguishing properties of
this instability a \emph{product-bi-Kappa distribution} is introduced, with the
advantage that this distribution function enables the use of different values
of the spectral index in the two directions, $\kappa_{\parallel} \ne
\kappa_{\perp}$. The growth rates and the instability threshold are derived and
contrasted with those for a simple bi-Kappa and a bi-Maxwellian. Thus, while
the maximum growth rates reached at the saturation are found to be higher, the
threshold is drastically reduced making the anisotropic product-bi-Kappa (with
small kappas) highly susceptible to the Weibel instability. This effect could
also rise questions on the temperature or the temperature anisotropy that seems
to be not an exclusive source of free energy for this instability, and
definition of these notions for such Kappa distributions must probably be
reconsidered.

domination-like and independence problems, such as Dominating Set, Independent
Set, Perfect Code, etc. A generalized domination (also called
$[\sigma,\rho]$-Dominating Set}) problem consists in finding a subset of
vertices in a graph such that every vertex is satisfied with respect to two
given sets of constraints $\sigma$ and $\rho$. Very few problems are known not
to be FPT when parameterized by tree-width, as usually this restriction allows
one to write efficient algorithms to solve the considered problems. The main
result of this article is a proof that for some (infinitely many) sets $\sigma$
and $\rho$, the problem $\exists[\sigma,\rho]$-Dominating Set} is W[1]-hard
when parameterized by the tree-width of the input graph. This contrasts with
the current knowledge on the parameterized complexity of this problem when
parameterized by tree-width, which had only been studied for finite and
cofinite sets $\sigma$ and $\rho$ and for which it has been shown to be FPT.

coding in communication networks. It is shown that the separation approach is
optimal in two general scenarios, and is approximately optimal in a third
scenario. The two scenarios for which separation is optimal complement each
other: the first is when the memoryless sources at source nodes are arbitrarily
correlated, each of which is to be reconstructed at possibly multiple
destinations within certain distortions, but the channels in this network are
synchronized, orthogonal and memoryless point-to-point channels; the second is
when the memoryless sources are mutually independent, each of which is to be
reconstructed only at one destination within a certain distortion, but the
channels are general, including multi-user channels such as multiple access,
broadcast, interference and relay channels, possibly with feedback. The third
scenario, for which we demonstrate approximate optimality of source-channel
separation, generalizes the second scenario by allowing each source to be
reconstructed at multiple destinations with different distortions. For this
case, the loss from optimality by using the separation approach can be
upper-bounded when a ""difference"" distortion measure is taken, and in the
special case of quadratic distortion measure, this leads to universal constant
bounds.

associated with interacting galactic systems and are thought to be powered by
merger--induced starbursts and/or dust--enshrouded AGN. In such systems, the
evolution of the dense, star forming molecular gas as a function of merger
separation is of particular interest. Here, we present observations of the
CO(3-2) emission from a sample of luminous infrared galaxy mergers that span a
range of galaxy-galaxy separations. The excitation of the molecular gas is
studied by examining the CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) line ratio, $r_{31}$, as a function of
merger extent. We find these line ratios, $r_{31}$, to be consistent with
kinetic temperatures of $T_k$=(30--50) K and gas densities of
$n_{\rm{H}_2}=10^3 \rm{cm}^{-3}$. We also find weak correlations between
$r_{31}$ and both merger progression and star formation efficiency
($L_{\rm{fIR}} / L_{\rm{CO(1-0)}}$). These correlations show a tendency for gas
excitation to increase as the merger progresses and the star formation
efficiency rises. To conclude, we calculate the contributions of the CO(3-2)
line to the 850 $\mu$m fluxes measured with SCUBA, which are seen to be
significant ($\sim$24%).

dynamical systems can have very different chaotic properties. Here we present a
numerical method to identify trajectories with atypical chaoticity, pathways
that are either more regular or more chaotic than average. The method is based
on the definition of an ensemble of trajectories weighted according to their
chaoticity, the Lyapunov weighted path ensemble. This ensemble of trajectories
is sampled using algorithms borrowed from transition path sampling, a method
originally developed to study rare transitions between long-lived states. We
demonstrate our approach by applying it to several systems with numbers of
degrees of freedom ranging from one to several hundred and in all cases the
algorithm found rare pathways with atypical chaoticity. For a double-well dimer
embedded in a solvent, which can be viewed as simple model for an isomerizing
molecule, rare reactive pathways were found for parameters strongly favoring
chaotic dynamics.

highly structured distribution indicative of a poloidal magnetic field inclined
