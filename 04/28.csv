selects events based on track impact parameters. However, the nature of the
selection requirements of the trigger introduces a large bias in the observed
proper decay time distribution. A lifetime measurement must correct for this
bias and the conventional approach has been to use a Monte Carlo simulation.
The leading sources of systematic uncertainty in the conventional approach are
due to differences between the data and the Monte Carlo simulation. In this
paper we present an analytic method for bias correction without using
simulation, thereby removing any uncertainty between data and simulation. This
method is presented in the form of a measurement of the lifetime of the $B^{-}$
using the mode B -> D0 pi. The $B^-$ lifetime is measured as $\tau_{B^-}$ =
1.663 $\pm$ 0.023 $\pm$ 0.015 ps, where the first uncertainty is statistical
and the second systematic. This new method results in a smaller systematic
uncertainty in comparison to methods that use simulation to correct for the

introduce a connection on $H$, and use parallel transport to identify different

notion of smooth and analytic fields of Hilbert spaces, and prove that if an
analytic field over a simply connected base is flat, then it corresponds to a
Hermitian Hilbert bundle with a flat connection and path independent parallel
transport. Second we address a general direct image problem in complex

non-proper map $Y-->S$. We give criteria for the direct image to be a smooth
field of Hilbert spaces. Third we consider quantizing an analytic Riemannian
manifold $M$ by endowing $TM$ with the family of adapted K\""ahler structures

homogeneous, we prove the direct image is an analytic field of Hilbert spaces.
For certain such $M$---but not all---the direct image is even flat; which means
that in those cases quantization is unique.

particularly Gaussian mixture distributions, has recently received significant
attention in theoretical computer science and machine learning. However,
despite major progress, the general question of polynomial learnability of
Gaussian mixture distributions still remained open. The current work resolves
the question of polynomial learnability for Gaussian mixtures in high dimension
with an arbitrary fixed number of components. The result on learning Gaussian
mixtures relies on an analysis of distributions belonging to what we call
""polynomial families"" in low dimension. These families are characterized by
their moments being polynomial in parameters and include almost all common
probability distributions as well as their mixtures and products. Using tools
from real algebraic geometry, we show that parameters of any distribution
belonging to such a family can be learned in polynomial time and using a
polynomial number of sample points. The result on learning polynomial families
is quite general and is of independent interest. To estimate parameters of a
Gaussian mixture distribution in high dimensions, we provide a deterministic
algorithm for dimensionality reduction. This allows us to reduce learning a
high-dimensional mixture to a polynomial number of parameter estimations in low
dimension. Combining this reduction with the results on polynomial families
yields our result on learning arbitrary Gaussian mixtures in high dimensions.

star masses and radii, if the Eddington flux and the apparent radius in the
cooling tail can be measured accurately, and distances to the sources are
known. We propose here an improved method of determining the basic stellar
parameters using the data from the cooling phase of photospheric radius
expansion bursts covering a large range of luminosities. Because at that phase
the blackbody apparent radius depends only on the spectral hardening factor
(color-correction), we suggest to fit the theoretical dependences of the
color-correction versus flux in Eddington units to the observed variations of
the inverse square root of the apparent blackbody radius with the flux. We show
that spectral variations observed during a long photospheric radius expansion
burst from 4U 1724-307 are entirely consistent with the theoretical
expectations for the passively cooling neutron star atmospheres. Our method
allows us to determine both the Eddington flux (which is found to be smaller
than the touchdown flux by 15%) and the ratio of the stellar apparent radius to
the distance much more reliably. We then find a lower limit on the neutron star
radius of 14 km for masses below 2.2M_sun, independently of the chemical
composition. These results suggest that the matter inside neutron stars is
characterized by a stiff equation of state. We finally show that the apparent
blackbody emitting area in the cooling tails of the short bursts from 4U
1724-307 is two times smaller than that for the long burst and their evolution
does not follow the theory. This makes their usage for determination of the
neutron star parameters questionable and casts serious doubts on the results of
previous works that used for the analysis similar bursts from other sources.

the use of observables from relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions to

pseudorapidity asymmetry, and charge ratio. We observe that both nuclear
modification factor and pseudorapidity asymmetry are quite sensitive to the
strength of gluon modifications in a wide pseudorapidity interval. The
sensitivity is greatly enhanced at LHC (Large Hadron Collider) energies
relative to that at RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider). The charge ratio is
mildly sensitive only at large Bjorken x. Thus measurement of these observables
in proton-lead collisions at the LHC affords the potential to further constrain
gluon modifications in global fits.

non-spherical capsules show tumbling and tank-treading motion in shear flow.
Theoretical descriptions of the transition between these two types of motion
assuming a fixed shape are at variance with the full capsule dynamics obtained
numerically. To resolve the discrepancy, we expand the exact equations of
motion for small deformations and find that shape changes play a dominant role.
We classify the dynamical phase transitions and obtain numerical and analytical
results for the phase boundaries as a function of viscosity contrast, shear and
elongational flow rate. We conclude with perspectives on timedependent flow, on
shear-induced unbinding from surfaces, on the role of thermal fluctuations, and

The general nonexistence proof still remains the open problem. In this work we
examine constant weight codes as well as doubly constant weight codes, and
reduce the range of parameters in which perfect codes may exist in both cases.
We start with the constant weight codes. We introduce an improvement of Roos'

polarized $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200-500\,$GeV to gain a
deeper insight into the spin structure and dynamics of the proton.
  One of the main objectives of the spin physics program at RHIC is the
extraction of the polarized gluon distribution function based on measurements
of gluon initiated processes, such as hadron and jet production. The STAR
detector is well suited for the reconstruction of various final states
involving jets, $\pi^{0}$, $\pi^{\pm}$, e$^{\pm}$ and $\gamma$, which allows to
measure several different processes. Recent results will be shown on the
measurement of jet production and hadron production at $\sqrt{s}=200\,$GeV. The
RHIC spin physics program has recently completed the first data taking period
in 2009 of polarized $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=500\,$GeV. This
opens a new era in the study of the spin-flavor structure of the proton based
on the production of $W^{-(+)}$ bosons. Recent STAR results on the first
measurement of $W$ boson production in polarized $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions
will be shown.

of solutions with prescribed asymptotic behavior on the singularity. Our proof

solar-like oscillating stars that have been observed up to now have given some
interesting results, specially concerning the amplitudes that are lower than
predicted. We present here the results from the analysis of the star HD
170987.The goal of this research work is to characterise the global parameters
of HD 170987. We look for global seismic parameters such as the mean large
separation, maximum amplitude of the modes, and surface rotation because the
signal-to-noise ratio in the observations do not allow us to measure individual
modes. We also want to retrieve the stellar parameters of the star and its
chemical composition.We have studied the chemical composition of the star using
ground-based observations performed with the NARVAL spectrograph. We have used
several methods to calculate the global parameters from the acoustic
oscillations based on CoRoT data. The light curve of the star has been
interpolated using inpainting algorithms to reduce the effect of data gaps. We
find power excess related to p modes in the range [400 - 1200]muHz with a mean
large separation of 55.2+-0.8muHz with a probability above 95% that increases
to 55.9 +-0.2muHz in a higher frequency range [500 - 1250] muHz and a rejection
level of 1%. A hint of the variation of this quantity with frequency is also
found. The rotation period of the star is estimated to be around 4.3 days with
an inclination axis of i=50 deg +20/-13. We measure a bolometric amplitude per
radial mode in a range [2.4 - 2.9] ppm around 1000 muHz. Finally, using a grid
of models, we estimate the stellar mass, M=1.43+-0.05 Msun, the radius,
R=1.96+-0.046 Rsun, and the age ~2.4 Gyr.

photometry covering a timespan of 91 days shows variability with a period of
P=16.9$^{+0.6}_{-0.3}$ days. The same period is also found in our spectral

shape as a function of time. The photometric variations nevertheless remain
coherent over several cycles and we estimate that the coherence timescale of
the light-curve is of the order of 60 days. The spectroscopy shows large-scale
line-profile variability which can be interpreted as excess emission peaks
moving from one side of the profile to the other on a timescale of several
days. Although we cannot unequivocally exclude the unlikely possibility that
WR1 is a binary, we propose that the nature of the variability we have found
strongly suggests that it is due to the presence in the wind of the WR star of
large-scale structures, most likely Co-rotating Interaction Regions (CIRs),
which are predicted to arise in inherently unstable radiatively driven winds
when they are perturbed at their base. We also suggest that variability
observed in WR6, WR134 and WR137 is of the same nature. Finally, assuming that
the period of CIRs is related to the rotational period, we estimate the
rotation rate of the four stars for which sufficient monitoring has been
carried out; i.e. v$_{rot}$=6.5, 40, 70 and 275 km/s for WR1, WR6, WR134 and

most massive ETGs (M_* > 10^{11} Msun) have shallow CGs in correspondence of
shallow (negative) Z gradients. In the stellar mass range 10^(10.3-10.5) < M_*
< 10^(11) Msun, the Z gradients reach their minimum of ~ -0.5 dex^{-1}. At M_*
~ 10^{10.3-10.5} Msun, color and Z gradient slopes suddenly change. They turn
out to anti-correlate with the mass, becoming highly positive at the very low
masses. We have also found that age gradients anti-correlate with Z gradients,
as predicted by hierarchical cosmological simulations for ETGs. On the other
side, LTGs have gradients which systematically decrease with mass (and are
always more negative than in ETGs), consistently with the expectation from gas
infall and SN feedback scenarios. Z is found to be the main driver of the trend
of color gradients, especially for LTGs, but age gradients are not negligible
and seem to play a significant role too. We have been able to highlight that
older galaxies have systematically shallower age and Z gradients than younger
ones. Our results for high-mass galaxies are in perfect agreement with

younger and less massive ETGs seems to be mainly driven by infall and SN

each sequence within fgas=0%-50%, keeping the disk and halo properties
unchanged. We find that the spatial resolution becomes important with an
increase in `fgas'. For the higher resolution model sequences, we observe a
bimodal behavior in the bar evolution with respect to the gas fraction,
especially during the secular phase of this evolution. The switch from the
gas-poor to gas-rich behavior is abrupt and depends on the resolution used. The
diverging evolution has been observed in nearly all basic parameters
characterizing bars, such as the bar strength, central mass concentration,
vertical buckling amplitude, size, etc. We find that the presence of the gas
component severely limits the bar growth and affects its pattern speed
evolution. Gas-poor models display rapidly decelerating bars, while gas-rich
models exhibit bars with constant or even slowly accelerating tumbling. The
gas-rich models have bar corotation (CR) radii within the disk at all times, in
constrast with gas-poor and purely stellar disks. The CR-to-bar size ratio is
less than 2 for gas rich-models. We have confirmed that the disk angular
momentum within the CR remains unchanged in the gas-poor models, as long as the
CR stays within the disk, but experiences a sharp drop before leveling off in
the gas-rich models. Finally, we discuss a number of observed correlations

investigate in a fairly model-independent way the detection at the LHC of
nearly degenerate gauginos with mass differences between a few GeV and about 30
GeV. Due to the degeneracy of gaugino states, the conventional leptonic signals
are likely lost. We first consider the leading signal from gluino production
and decay. We find that it is quite conceivable to reach a large statistical
significance for the multi-jet plus missing energy signal with an integrated
luminosity about 50 pb^-1 (50 fb^-1) for a gluino mass of 500 GeV (1 TeV). If
gluinos are not too heavy, less than about 1.5 TeV, this channel can typically
probe gaugino masses up to about 100 GeV below the gluino mass. We then study
the Drell-Yan type of gaugino pair production in association with a hard QCD
jet, for gaugino masses in the range of 100-150 GeV. The signal observation may
be statistically feasible with about 10 fb^-1, but systematically challenging
due to the lack of distinctive features for the signal distributions. By
exploiting gaugino pair production through weak boson fusion, signals of large
missing energy plus two forward-backward jets may be observable at a 4-6\sigma
level above the large SM backgrounds with an integrated luminosity of 100-300
fb^-1. Finally, we point out that searching for additional isolated soft muons
in the range p_T ~3-10 GeV in the data samples discussed above may help to
enrich the signal and to control the systematics. Significant efforts are made
to explore the connection between the signal kinematics and the relevant masses
for the gluino and gauginos, to probe the mass scales of the superpartners, in
particular the LSP dark matter.

(weighted) cut in G' is within (1\pm \eps) of the corresponding cut in G. A
celebrated result of Benczur and Karger shows that for every undirected graph
G, an \eps-sparsification with O(n\log n/\e^2) edges can be constructed in
O(m\log^2n) time. Applications to modern massive data sets often constrain
algorithms to use computation models that restrict random access to the input.
The semi-streaming model, in which the algorithm is constrained to use \tilde
O(n) space, has been shown to be a good abstraction for analyzing graph
algorithms in applications to large data sets. Recently, a semi-streaming
algorithm for graph sparsification was presented by Anh and Guha; the total
running time of their implementation is \Omega(mn), too large for applications
where both space and time are important. In this paper, we introduce a new
technique for graph sparsification, namely refinement sampling, that gives an
\tilde{O}(m) time semi-streaming algorithm for graph sparsification.
  Specifically, we show that refinement sampling can be used to design a
one-pass streaming algorithm for sparsification that takes O(\log\log n) time
per edge, uses O(\log^2 n) space per node, and outputs an \eps-sparsifier with
O(n\log^3 n/\eps^2) edges. At a slightly increased space and time complexity,
we can reduce the sparsifier size to O(n \log n/\e^2) edges matching the
Benczur-Karger result, while improving upon the Benczur-Karger runtime for
m=\omega(n\log^3 n). Finally, we show that an \eps-sparsifier with O(n \log
n/\eps^2) edges can be constructed in two passes over the data and O(m) time
whenever m =\Omega(n^{1+\delta}) for some constant \delta>0. As a by-product of
our approach, we also obtain an O(m\log\log n+n \log n) time streaming
algorithm to compute a sparse k-connectivity certificate of a graph.

nucleosynthesis. In previous works, the NDW has been implicated as a possible
source of r-process and light p-process isotopes. In this paper we present
time-dependent hydrodynamic calculations of nucleosynthesis in the NDW which
include accurate weak interaction physics coupled to a full nuclear reaction
network. Using two published models of PNS neutrino luminosities, we predict
the contribution of the NDW to the integrated nucleosynthetic yield of the
entire supernova. For the neutrino luminosity histories considered, no true
r-process occurs in the most basic scenario. The wind driven from an older $1.4
M_\odot$ model for a PNS is moderately neutron-rich at late times however, and
produces $^{87}$Rb, $^{88}$Sr, $^{89}$Y, and $^{90}$Zr in near solar
proportions relative to oxygen. The wind from a more recently studied $1.27
M_\odot$ PNS is proton-rich throughout its entire evolution and does not
contribute significantly to the abundance of any element. It thus seems very
unlikely that the simplest model of the NDW can produce the r-process. At most,
it contributes to the production of the N = 50 closed shell elements and some
light p-nuclei. In doing so, it may have left a distinctive signature on the
abundances in metal poor stars, but the results are sensitive to both uncertain
models for the explosion and the masses of the neutron stars involved.

inadequate to discover and observe rapidly pulsating astronomical sources. It
is therefore conceivable that there exist some classes of objects pulsating
with extremely short periods that have not yet been discovered. This article
starts from the fact that rapid flux variations generate a spectral modulation
that can be detected in the beat spectrum of the output current fluctuations of
a quadratic detector. The telescope could observe at any frequency, although
shorter frequencies would have the advantage of lower photon noise. The
techniques would allow us to find and observe extremely fast time variations,
opening up a new time window in Astronomy. The current fluctuation technique,
like intensity interferometers, uses second-order correlation effects and fits
into the current renewal of interest in intensity interferometry. An
interesting aspect it shares with intensity interferometry is that it can use
inexpensive large telescope that have low-quality mirrors, like Cherenkov
telescopes. It has other advantages over conventional techniques that measure
time variations, foremost of which is its simplicity. Consequently, it could be
used for extended monitoring of astronomical sources, something that is
difficult to do with conventional telescopes. Arguably, the most interesting
scientific justification for the technique comes from Serendipity

angle $\alpha_{NP}$ of the potential field due to nonpotentiality is found to
correlate with the soft X-ray flux of the active region, which implies a
relationship between electric currents and plasma heating.

has previously been developed using a bar resolution restricted to measurable
cochains. That theory was shown to enjoy analogs of most of the standard
algebraic properties of group cohomology, but various analytic features of
those cohomology groups were only partially understood.
  This paper re-examines some of those issues. At its heart is a simple
dimension-shifting argument which enables one to `regularize' measurable
cocycles, leading to some simplifications in the description of the cohomology
groups. A range of consequences are then derived from this argument.
  First, we prove that for target modules that are Fr\'echet spaces, the
cohomology groups agree with those defined using continuous cocycles, and hence
they vanish in positive degrees when the acting group is compact. Using this,
we then show that for Fr\'echet, discrete or toral modules the cohomology
groups are continuous under forming inverse limits of compact base groups, and
also under forming direct limits of discrete target modules.
  Lastly, these results together enable us to establish various circumstances
under which the measurable-cochains cohomology groups coincide with others
defined using sheaves on a semi-simplicial space associated to the underlying
group, or sheaves on a classifying space for that group. We also prove in some
cases that the natural quotient topologies on the measurable-cochains
cohomology groups are Hausdorff.

Typos are corrected",,,,"cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We often encounter probability distributions given as unnormalized products
of non-negative functions. The factorization structures are represented by
hypergraphs called factor graphs. Such distributions appear in various fields,
including statistics, artificial intelligence, statistical physics, error
correcting codes, etc. Given such a distribution, computations of marginal
distributions and the normalization constant are often required. However, they
are computationally intractable because of their computational costs. One
successful approximation method is Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) algorithm.
The focus of this thesis is an analysis of the LBP algorithm. If the factor
graph is a tree, i.e. having no cycle, the algorithm gives the exact
quantities. If the factor graph has cycles, however, the LBP algorithm does not
give exact results and possibly exhibits oscillatory and non-convergent
behaviors. The thematic question of this thesis is ""How the behaviors of the
LBP algorithm are affected by the discrete geometry of the factor graph?"" The
primary contribution of this thesis is the discovery of a formula that
establishes the relation between the LBP, the Bethe free energy and the graph
zeta function. This formula provides new techniques for analysis of the LBP
algorithm, connecting properties of the graph and of the LBP and the Bethe free
energy. We demonstrate applications of the techniques to several problems
including (non) convexity of the Bethe free energy, the uniqueness and
stability of the LBP fixed point. We also discuss the loop series initiated by
Chertkov and Chernyak. The loop series is a subgraph expansion of the
normalization constant, or partition function, and reflects the graph geometry.

propagation of radio frequency fields in plasmas. While the information gained
from the rays is quite useful, an approximate solution for the fields would
also be valuable, e.g., for comparison to full wave simulations. Such
approximations are often difficult to perform numerically because of the
special care which must be taken to correctly reconstruct the fields near
reflection and focusing caustics. In this paper, we compare the standard
eikonal method for approximating fields to a method based on the dynamics of
wave packets. We compare the approximations resulting from these two methods to
the analytical solution for a lower hybrid wave reflecting from a cutoff. The
algorithm based on wave packets has the advantage that it can correctly deal
with caustics, without any special treatment.

channel with a cognitive relay, i.e., a relay that has non-causal knowledge of
both independent messages transmitted in the interference channel. This outer
bound reduces to the capacity region of the deterministic broadcast channel and
of the deterministic cognitive interference channel through nulling of certain
channel inputs. It does not, however, reduce to that of certain deterministic
interference channels for which capacity is known. As such, we subsequently
tighten the bound for channels whose outputs satisfy an ""invertibility""
condition. This second outer bound now reduces to the capacity of this special
class of deterministic interference channels. The second outer bound is further
tightened for the high SNR deterministic approximation of the Gaussian
interference channel with a cognitive relay by exploiting the special structure
of the interference. We provide an example that suggests that this third bound
is tight in at least some parameter regimes for the high SNR deterministic
approximation of the Gaussian channel. Another example shows that the third
bound is capacity in the special case where there are no direct links between
the non-cognitive transmitters.

Different rows of a Delsarte-Goethals sieve may not be orthogonal, and we
present an effective algorithm for identifying all pairs of non-orthogonal

leads to a tight frame. Experimental results suggest that all $DG(m,r)$ sieves

studies of intermediate and late-time behaviour of massive Dirac hair in the

of a global monopole swallowed by a static black hole the intermediate
late-time behaviour depends on the mass of the Dirac field, the multiple number
of the wave mode and the global monopole parameter. The late-time behaviour is
quite independent of these factors and has the decay rate proportional to
$t^{-5/6}$. As far as the black hole pierced by a cosmic string is concerned
the intermediate late-time behaviour depends only on the hair mass and the
multipole number of the wave mode while the late-time behaviour dependence is
the same as in the previous case. The main modification stems from the topology
of the $S^2$ sphere pierced by a cosmic string. This factor modifies the
eigenvalues of the Dirac operator acting on the transverse manifold.

increase the efficiency and stability of selected portfolios among a vast pool
of assets, as demonstrated in Fan et al (2008). The required high-dimensional
volatility matrix can be estimated by using high frequency financial data. This
enables us to better adapt to the local volatilities and local correlations
among vast number of assets and to increase significantly the sample size for
estimating the volatility matrix. This paper studies the volatility matrix
estimation using high-dimensional high-frequency data from the perspective of
portfolio selection. Specifically, we propose the use of ""pairwise-refresh
time"" and ""all-refresh time"" methods proposed by Barndorff-Nielsen et al (2008)
for estimation of vast covariance matrix and compare their merits in the
portfolio selection. We also establish the concentration inequalities of the
estimates, which guarantee desirable properties of the estimated volatility
matrix in vast asset allocation with gross exposure constraints. Extensive
numerical studies are made via carefully designed simulations. Comparing with
the methods based on low frequency daily data, our methods can capture the most
recent trend of the time varying volatility and correlation, hence provide more
accurate guidance for the portfolio allocation in the next time period. The
advantage of using high-frequency data is significant in our simulation and
empirical studies, which consist of 50 simulated assets and 30 constituent

polynomial (given for instance by an arithmetic circuit) is identically equal
to 0. In this paper, we show that a deterministic black-box identity testing
algorithm for (high-degree) univariate polynomials would imply a lower bound on
the arithmetic complexity of the permanent. The lower bounds that are known to
follow from derandomization of (low-degree) multivariate identity testing are
weaker. To obtain our lower bound it would be sufficient to derandomize
identity testing for polynomials of a very specific norm: sums of products of
sparse polynomials with sparse coefficients. This observation leads to new
versions of the Shub-Smale tau-conjecture on integer roots of univariate
polynomials. In particular, we show that a lower bound for the permanent would
follow if one could give a good enough bound on the number of real roots of
sums of products of sparse polynomials (Descartes' rule of signs gives such a
bound for sparse polynomials and products thereof). In this third version of
our paper we show that the same lower bound would follow even if one could only
prove a slightly superpolynomial upper bound on the number of real roots. This
is a consequence of a new result on reduction to depth 4 for arithmetic
circuits which we establish in a companion paper. We also show that an even
weaker bound on the number of real roots would suffice to obtain a lower bound
on the size of depth 4 circuits computing the permanent.

(BHs) in a higher-dimensional spacetime of special symmetries for the
dimensionality $6 \leq d \leq 8$. We find that higher-dimensional BHs, spinning
rapidly enough, are dynamically unstable against nonaxisymmetric bar-mode
deformation and spontaneously emit gravitational waves, irrespective of $d$ as
in the case $d=5$ \cite{SY09}. The critical values of a nondimensional spin
parameter for the onset of the instability are $q:=a/\mu^{1/(d-3)} \approx
0.74$ for $d=6$, $\approx 0.73$ for $d=7$, and $\approx 0.77$ for $d=8$ where
$\mu$ and $a$ are mass and spin parameters. Black holes with a spin smaller
than these critical values ($q_{\rm crit}$) appear to be dynamically stable for
any perturbation. Longterm simulations for the unstable BHs are also performed
for $d=6$ and 7. We find that they spin down as a result of gravitational-wave
emission and subsequently settle to a stable stationary BH of a spin smaller
than $q_{\rm crit}$. For more rapidly spinning unstable BHs, the timescale, for
which the new state is reached, is shorter and fraction of the spin-down is
larger. Our findings imply that a highly rapidly spinning BH with $q > q_{\rm
crit}$ cannot be a stationary product in the particle accelerators, even if it
would be formed as a consequence of a TeV-gravity hypothesis. Its implications
for the phenomenology of a mini BH are discussed.

is solved in order to investigate the relationship between the failure of the
usual adiabatic approximation assumption and the physical parameters of the
trap. This allows to evaluate the effect that reversing of the bias field
rotation produces on the vertical position of the atomic orbit, a displacement
that is closely related to the adiabatic character of the trap motion. The
present investigation has been motivated by a similar experimental test
previously carried out in the actual magnetic time orbiting potential trap. We
find that the non-adiabatic effects provided by the classical model are
extremely small. Thus, we conclude that the theoretical explanation of the
experimental measures, requires a quantum description of the dynamics in
magnetic traps.

coli is integral for detecting chemicals over a wide range of background

demethylation of chemoreceptors has long been known. Despite the importance of
adaptation for cell memory and behavior, the dynamics of adaptation are
difficult to reconcile with current models of precise adaptation. Here, we
follow time courses of signaling in response to concentration step changes of
attractant using in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements.
Specifically, we use a condensed representation of adaptation time courses for
efficient evaluation of different adaptation models. To quantitatively explain
the data, we finally develop a dynamic model for signaling and adaptation based
on the attractant flow in the experiment, signaling by cooperative receptor
complexes, and multiple layers of feedback regulation for adaptation. We
experimentally confirm the predicted effects of changing the enzyme-expression
level and bypassing the negative feedback for demethylation. Our data analysis
suggests significant imprecision in adaptation for large additions.
Furthermore, our model predicts highly regulated, ultrafast adaptation in
response to removal of attractant, which may be useful for fast reorientation
of the cell and noise reduction in adaptation.

where the distribution between oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N) containing molecular
species is co-spatial within the telescope beam. Previous work has presumed
that similar cores with co-spatial O and N species may be an indicator for
detecting acetic acid. However, does this presumption hold as higher spatial
resolution observations become available of large O and N-containing molecules?
As the number of detected acetic acid sources is still low, more observations
are needed to support this postulate. In this paper, we report the first acetic
acid survey conducted with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave
Astronomy (CARMA) at 3 mm wavelengths towards G19.61-0.23, G29.96-0.02 and IRAS
16293-2422. We have successfully detected CH$_3$COOH via two transitions toward
G19.61-0.23 and tentatively confirmed the detection toward IRAS 16293-2422 A.
The determined column density of CH$_3$COOH is 2.0(1.0)$\times 10^{16}$

is 2.2(0.1)$\times 10^{-1}$ toward G19.61-0.23. Toward IRAS 16293 A, the

is $\sim$ 1.0 $\times 10^{-1}$ both of which are consistent with abundance
ratios determined toward other hot cores. Finally, we model all known line
emission in our passband to determine physical conditions in the regions and
introduce a new metric to better reveal weak spectral features that are blended

linear, height one, and can be deposited randomly only in the two, $x$ and $y$
directions of the substrate, and occupy an integer number of cells of the
lattice. We show there are three different regimes for the temporal evolution
of the interface width. At the initial times we observe an uncorrelated growth,
with an exponent $\beta_{1}$ characteristic of the random deposition model. At
intermediate times, the interface width presents an unusual behavior, described
by a growing exponent $\beta_{2}$, which depends on the size of the particles
added to the substrate. If the linear size of the particle is two we have
$\beta_{2}<\beta_{1}$, otherwise we have $\beta_{2}>\beta_{1}$, for all other
particle sizes. After a long time the growth reaches the saturation regime
where the interface width becomes constant and is described by the roughness
exponent $\alpha$, which is nearly independent of the size of the particle.
Similar results are found in the surface growth due to the electrophoretic
deposition of polymer chains. Contrary to one-dimensional results the growth
exponents are non-universal.

be shown to be invariant to the set of continuous deformations vanishing at the
polymer's end-point and which forbid it from passing through itself. This
measure is shown to be the appropriate constraint required to evaluate the
geometrical properties of a constrained DNA molecule. Using the net winding
measure we define a model of an open ended constrained DNA molecule which
combines the necessary constraint of self-avoidance with being analytically
tractable. This model builds upon the local models of Bouchiat and Mezard
(2000). In particular, we present a new derivation of the polar writhe
expression, which detects both the local winding of the curve and non local
winding between different sections of the curve. We then show that this

for several tens of picoseconds combining the dynamics of the liquid with an
adiabatic evolution for the electron. The path followed by the excited bubble
in its decay to the ground state is shown to strongly depend on pressure. While
for pressures below 1 bar the 1P excited electron bubble has allowance for
radiatively decay to the deformed ground state, evolving then non-radiatively
towards the ground state of the spherical electron bubble, we have found that
above 1 bar two distinct baby bubbles appear in the course of the dynamical
evolution, pointing to a different relaxation path in which the electron may be
localized in one of the baby bubbles while the other collapses, allowing for a
pure radiationless de-excitation. Our calculations are in agreement with
experiments indicating that relaxed 1P bubbles are only observed for pressures
smaller than a critical one, of the order of 1 bar, and that above this value
the decay of the excited bubble has to proceed differently. A similar analysis
carried out for the 2P bubble shows that the adiabatic approximation fails at
an early stage of its dynamical evolution due to the crossing of the 2P and 1F
states.

smaller for a larger volume fraction. At high concentrations, hydrodynamic
interactions between close particles significantly decrease elongation of the
suspension drop along the flow in comparison to the corresponding elongation of

The cases of evolution theory, global warming and H1N1 pandemic influenza are

neutral and resolved. To adopt a cautious balanced attitude based on clear but
inconclusive data appears to be a lose-out strategy. In contrast overstating
arguments with wrong claims which cannot be scientifically refuted appear to be
necessary but not sufficient to eventually win a public debate. The underlying
key mechanism of these puzzling and unfortunate conclusions are identified
using the Galam sequential probabilistic model of opinion dynamics. It reveals
that the existence of inflexible agents and their respective proportions are
the instrumental parameters to determine the faith of incomplete scientific
data public debates. Acting on one's own inflexible proportion modifies the
topology of the flow diagram, which in turn can make irrelevant initial
supports. On the contrary focusing on open-minded agents may be useless given
some topologies. When the evidence is not as strong as claimed, the inflexibles
rather than the data are found to drive the opinion of the population. The
results shed a new but disturbing light on designing adequate strategies to win
a public debate.

perspective. The approach uses classical and quantum versions of normal form
theory and the perspective of dynamical systems theory. Over the past ten years
the classical normal form theory has provided a method for realizing the phase
space structures that are responsible for determining reactions in high
dimensional Hamiltonian systems. This has led to the understanding that a new
(to reaction dynamics) type of phase space structure, a {\em normally
hyperbolic invariant manifold} (or, NHIM) is the ""anchor"" on which the phase
space structures governing reaction dynamics are built. The quantum normal form
theory provides a method for quantizing these phase space structures through
the use of the Weyl quantization procedure. We show that this approach provides
a solution of the time-independent Schr\""odinger equation leading to a (local)
S-matrix in a neighborhood of the saddle point governing the reaction. It
follows easily that the quantization of the directional flux through the
dividing surface with the properties noted above is a flux operator that can be
expressed in a ""closed form"". Moreover, from the local S-matrix we easily
obtain an expression for the cumulative reactio probability (CRP).
Significantly, the expression for the CRP can be evaluated without the need to
compute classical trajectories. The quantization of the NHIM is shown to lead
to the activated complex, and the lifetimes of quantum states initialized on
the NHIM correspond to the Gamov-Siegert resonances. We apply these results to
the collinear nitrogen exchange reaction and a three degree-of-freedom system
corresponding to an Eckart barrier coupled to two Morse oscillators.

-5.96, -5.4 and -4.75) are carbon-rich, they are called C-Rich Ultra-Metal Poor
Stars (CRUMPS). The origin of their peculiar surface abundances is not
understood. We propose a synthetic view of the different models so far proposed
to explain the peculiar abundances observed at the surface of the CRUMP stars.
We deduce some expected trends based on nucleosynthetic arguments and look for
signatures allowing to discriminate among models. We discuss the conditions for
having CRUMP stars which are He-rich, i.e. with a mass fraction of helium
greater than 0.30 and up to 0.60. We discuss the chemical composition of stars
made of interstellar medium mixed with wind material of very metal poor massive
stars, with wind plus supernova ejecta and with material extracted from the
envelope of early AGB stars. Rotating and non-rotating models are considered.
CRUMP stars formed from wind material of massive stars mixed with small amounts
of pristine interstellar medium are He-rich (helium mass fraction between 0.30
and 0.60), Li-depleted and present low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios (inferior to 10
in number). Such He-rich stars, if discovered, would confirm that the most
metal poor CRUMPs formed from essentially pure wind/envelope material. They
would provide the most direct way to probe the nucleosynthetic outputs of the
first generations of stars. We show that rotation is a key ingredient to
explain the abundance patterns of CRUMPS stars.

To appear, SIAM Review.",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compressed Sensing (CS) seeks to recover an unknown vector with $N$ entries
by making far fewer than $N$ measurements; it posits that the number of
compressed sensing measurements should be comparable to the information content
of the vector, not simply $N$. CS combines the important task of compression
directly with the measurement task. Since its introduction in 2004 there have
been hundreds of manuscripts on CS, a large fraction of which develop
algorithms to recover a signal from its compressed measurements. Because of the
paradoxical nature of CS -- exact reconstruction from seemingly undersampled
measurements -- it is crucial for acceptance of an algorithm that rigorous
analyses verify the degree of undersampling the algorithm permits. The
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) has become the dominant tool used for the
analysis in such cases. We present here an asymmetric form of RIP which gives
tighter bounds than the usual symmetric one. We give the best known bounds on
the RIP constants for matrices from the Gaussian ensemble. Our derivations
illustrate the way in which the combinatorial nature of CS is controlled. Our
quantitative bounds on the RIP allow precise statements as to how aggressively
a signal can be undersampled, the essential question for practitioners. We also
document the extent to which RIP gives precise information about the true
performance limits of CS, by comparing with approaches from high-dimensional
geometry.

time interval of about 10 yr. The achieved velocity accuracy is of the order of
0.1 km/s, adequate to precisely measure the relative velocities of most of the
12 GHz masers in W3(OH), with amplitude varying in the range 0.3 - 3 km/s.
Towards W3(OH), the most intense 12 GHz masers concentrate in a small area
towards the north (the northern clump) of the UCHII region. We have compared
the proper motions of the CH3OH 12 GHz masers with those (derived from
literature data) of the OH 6035 MHz masers, emitting from the same region of
the methanol masers. In the northern clump, the two maser emissions emerge from
nearby (but likely distinct) cloudlets of masing gas with, in general, a rather
smooth variation of line-of-sight and sky-projected velocities, which suggests
some connection of the environments and kinematics traced by both maser types.
The conical outflow model, previously proposed to account for the 12 GHz maser
kinematics in the northern clump, does not reproduce the new, accurate
measurements of 12 GHz maser proper motions and has to be rejected. We focus on
the subset of 12 GHz masers of the northern clump belonging to the ""linear
structure at P.A. = 130-140 degree"", whose regular variation of LSR velocities
with position presents evidence for some ordered motion. We show that the
3-dimensional velocities of this ""linear distribution"" of 12GHz masers can be

reduction, their implementation is computationally intensive and not applicable
to realistic payoffs, in particular not to Asian options with barrier.
Moreover, all these previously published methods employ orthogonal directions
for multiple stratification. In this work we investigate the use of algorithms
producing convenient directions, generally non-orthogonal, combining a lower
computational cost with a comparable variance reduction. In addition, we study
the accuracy of optimal allocation in terms of variance reduction compared to
the Latin Hypercube Sampling. We consider the directions obtained by the Linear

algorithm that permits to correctly generate normal vectors stratified along
non-orthogonal directions. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency of these

within a circuit QED system. An array of N superconducting qubits interacts
with a driven cavity mode. In the dispersive regime, the cavity mode is
adiabatically eliminated generating an effective model for the qubits alone.
The characteristic long-range order of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model is here
mediated by the cavity field. For a closed qubit system, the inherent second
order phase transition of the qubits is reflected in the intensity of the
output cavity field. In the broken symmetry phase, the many-body ground state
is highly entangled. Relaxation of the qubits is analyzed within a mean-field
treatment. The second order phase transition is lost, while new bistable
regimes occur.

collisionless tracers in the form of disk stars to measure the surface-density

density profile in the inner regions of galaxies. We find a disk inclination
range of 25-35 degrees is optimal for our measurements, consistent with our
survey design to select nearly face-on galaxies. Uncertainties in disk
scale-heights are significant, but can be estimated from radial scale-lengths
to 25% now, and more precisely in the future. We detail the spectroscopic
analysis used to derive line-of-sight velocity dispersions, precise at low
surface-brightness, and accurate in the presence of composite stellar
populations. Our methods take full advantage of large-grasp integral-field
spectroscopy and an extensive library of observed stars. We show that the
baryon-to-total mass fraction (F_b) is not a well-defined observational
quantity because it is coupled to the halo mass model. This remains true even
when the disk mass is known and spatially-extended rotation curves are
available. In contrast, the fraction of the rotation speed supplied by the disk
at 2.2 scale lengths (disk maximality) is a robust observational indicator of
the baryonic disk contribution to the potential. We construct the error-budget
for the key quantities: dynamical disk mass surface-density, disk stellar
mass-to-light ratio, and disk maximality (V_disk / V_circular). Random and
systematic errors in these quantities for individual galaxies will be ~25%,
while survey precision for sample quartiles are reduced to 10%, largely devoid
of systematic errors outside of distance uncertainties.

have still undetected components, thus hampering the study of their properties.
AIMS. I study a sample of massive stars with high angular resolution to better
characterize their multiplicity. METHODS. I observed 138 fields that include at
least one massive star with AstraLux, a lucky imaging camera at the 2.2 m Calar
Alto telescope. I also used observations of 3 of those fields with ACS/HRC on
HST to obtain complementary information and to calibrate the AstraLux data. The
results were compared with existing information from the Washington Double Star
Catalog, Tycho-2, 2MASS, and other literature results. RESULTS. I discover 16
new optical companions of massive stars, the majority of which are likely to be
physically bound to their primaries. I also improve the accuracy for the
separation and magnitude difference of many previously known systems. In a few
cases the orbital motion is detected when comparing the new data with existing
ones and constraints on the orbits are provided. CONCLUSIONS. The analysis
indicate that the majority of the AstraLux detections are bound pairs. For a
range of separations of 0.1""-14"" and magnitude differences lower than 8, I find
that the multiplicity fraction for massive stars is close to 50%. When objects
outside those ranges are included, the multiplicity fraction should be
considerably higher.

by measuring the non-negative Jensen difference induced by a strictly convex
and differentiable function. Although those Burbea-Rao divergences are
symmetric by construction, they are not metric since they fail to satisfy the

Bregman divergences called Jensen-Bregman distances yields exactly those
Burbea-Rao divergences. We then proceed by defining skew Burbea-Rao

compute Bregman divergences. We then prove that Burbea-Rao centroids are
unique, and can be arbitrarily finely approximated by a generic iterative
concave-convex optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence property. In
the second part of the paper, we consider the Bhattacharyya distance that is
commonly used to measure overlapping degree of probability distributions. We
show that Bhattacharyya distances on members of the same statistical
exponential family amount to calculate a Burbea-Rao divergence in disguise.
Thus we get an efficient algorithm for computing the Bhattacharyya centroid of
a set of parametric distributions belonging to the same exponential families,
improving over former specialized methods found in the literature that were

performance of our Bhattacharyya/Burbea-Rao centroid algorithm, we present
experimental performance results for $k$-means and hierarchical clustering

the possibility of mini black holes detection in the LHC as a signature for the

  The Chapter 2 will deal with f(R) theories able to mimic Einstein-Hilbert
plus cosmological constant solutions and f(R) theories will be shown to be able
to mimic the cosmological evolution generated by any perfect fluid with
constant equation of state.
  The Chapter 3 will be devoted to the computation of cosmological
perturbations for f(R) theories. Special attention will be paid here to obtain
a completely general differential equation for the evolution of perturbations
and its particularization for the so-called sub-Hubble scales will be
explicitly shown.
  In the Chapter 4 we shall focus on the study of black holes in f(R) gravities
in an arbitrary number of dimensions. With this purpose we shall study constant
curvature solutions for f(R) theories as well as perturbative solutions around
the standard SAdS geometry. An important part of this chapter will be then
devoted to the thermodynamics of SAdS black holes in f(R) theories.
  In the Chapter 5 we will thoroughly study brane-skyrmions. In this context,
the recent claim of detection of an unexpected feature in the CMB, referred to
as the cold spot, will be explained as a topological defect on the brane in
complete agreement with those calculations in the literature that tried to
explain that cold spot as a texture of a NLSM.

of biaxial hard particles (cuboids) is examined theoretically by means of
Onsager second-order virial theory in the limit where the long particle axes
are frozen in a mutually parallel configuration. Confinement is induced by two
parallel planar hard walls (slit-pore geometry), with particle long axes
perpendicular to the walls (perfect homeotropic anchoring). In bulk, a
continuous nematic-to-smectic transition takes place, while shape anisotropy in
the (rectangular) particle cross section induces biaxial ordering. As a
consequence, four bulk phases, uniaxial and biaxial nematic and smectic phases,
can be stabilised as the cross-sectional aspect ratio is varied. On confining
the fluid, the nematic-to-smectic transition is suppressed, and either uniaxial
or biaxial phases, separated by a continuous trasition, can be present. Smectic
ordering develops continuously from the walls for increasing particle
concentration (in agreement with the supression of nematic-smectic second order
transition at confinement), but first-order layering transitions, involving
structures with n and n+1 layers, arise in the confined fluid at high
concentration. Competition between layering and uniaxial-biaxial ordering leads
to three different types of layering transitions, at which the two coexisting
structures can be both uniaxial, one uniaxial and another biaxial, or both
biaxial. Also, the interplay between molecular biaxiality and wall interactions
is very subtle: while the hard wall disfavours the formation of the biaxial
phase, biaxiality is against the layering transitions, as we have shown by
comparing the confined phase behaviour of cylinders and cuboids. The predictive
power of Onsager theory is checked and confirmed by performing some
calculations based on fundamental-measure theory.

LEs in the other [N. J. Cornish and J. Levin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 179001
(2002)] does not mainly depend on rescaling, but is due to two slightly
different treatments of the LEs. It takes much more CPU time to obtain the
stabilizing limit values as reliable values of LEs for the former than to get
the slopes (equal to LEs) of the fit lines for the latter. Due to coalescence
of some of the black holes, the LEs from the former are not an adaptive
indicator of chaos for comparable mass compact binaries. In this case, the
invariant fast Lyapunov indicator (FLI) of two-nearby orbits, as a very
sensitive tool to distinguish chaos from order, is worth recommending. As a
result, we do again find chaos in the 2PN approximation through different
ratios of FLIs varying with time. Chaos cannot indeed be ruled out in real
binaries.

of star formation in spite of lacking a strong bar. This morphology is
interesting because it is generally accepted that a typical ring forms when
material collects near a resonance, set up by the pattern speed of a bar or
bar-like perturbation. Our goal in this paper is to examine whether the ring
star formation properties are related to the non-axisymmetric gravity potential
in general. For this purpose, we obtained H{\alpha} emission line images and
calculated the line fluxes and star formation rates (SFRs) for 16 nonbarred SA
galaxies and four weakly barred SAB galaxies with rings. For comparison, we
combine our observations with a re-analysis of previously published data on
five SA, seven SAB, and 15 SB galaxies with rings, three of which are
duplicates from our sample. With these data, we examine what role a bar may
play in the star formation process in rings. Compared to barred ringed
galaxies, we find that the inner ring SFRs and H{\alpha}+[N ii] equivalent
widths in nonbarred ringed galaxies show a similar range and trend with
absolute blue magnitude, revised Hubble type, and other parameters. On the
whole, the star formation properties of inner rings, excluding the distribution
of H ii regions, are independent of the ring shapes and the bar strength in our
small samples. We confirm that the deprojected axis ratios of inner rings
correlate with maximum relative gravitational force Q_g; however, if we
consider all rings, a better correlation is found when local bar forcing at the
radius of the ring, Q_r, is used. Individual cases are described and other
correlations are discussed. By studying the physical properties of these
galaxies, we hope to gain a better understanding of their placement in the
scheme of the Hubble sequence and how they formed rings without the driving
force of a bar.

Hii regions distributed along its bar. We aim to analyse the star formation
properties in the bar region of NGC 2903 and study the links with the typical
bar morphological features. A combination of space and ground-based data from
the far-ultraviolet to the sub-millimeter spectral ranges is used to create a
panchromatic view of the NGC 2903 bar. We produce two catalogues: one for the
current star formation regions, as traced by the halpha compact emission, and a
second one for the ultraviolet (UV) emitting knots, containing positions and
luminosities. From them we have obtained ultraviolet colours, star formation
rates, dust attenuation and halpha EWs, and their spatial distribution have
been analysed. Stellar cluster ages have been estimated using stellar
population synthesis models (Starburst99). NGC 2903 is a complex galaxy, with a
very different morphology on each spectral band. The CO(J=1-0) and the 3.6
micron emission trace each other in a clear barred structure, while the halpha
leads both components and it has an s-shape distribution. The UV emission is
patchy and does not resemble a bar. The UV emission is also characterised by a
number of regions located symmetrically with respect to the galaxy center,
almost perpendicular to the bar, in a spiral shape covering the inner ~2.5 kpc.
These regions do not show a significant halpha nor 24 micron emission. We have
estimated ages for these regions ranging from 150 to 320 Myr, being older than
the rest of the UV knots, which have ages lower than 10 Myr. The SFR calculated
from the UV emission is ~0.4 M$_{\odot}$/yr, compatible with the SFR as derived
from halpha calibrations (M$_{\odot}$/yr).

reduced greatly by exploring the symmetry of VBS state, and then the fully
separable state can be determined explicitly. Numerical evaluation for GE by
the random simulation is also implemented in order to demonstrate the validity
of the reductions. Our calculations show that GE is saturated by a finite value
with the increment of particle number, that means that the total entanglement
for VBS state would be divergent under the thermodynamic limit. Moreover it is
found that the scaling behavior of GE with spin number $s$ is fitted as
$\alpha\log (s+\tfrac{\beta}{s}+\gamma)+\delta$, in which the values of the
parameters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \sigma$ are only dependent on the parity of
