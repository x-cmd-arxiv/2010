which the rank of the differential dF is less than the minimum of dimensions of

the closure of S. We introduce and study new invariants of singular sets for
which the classical invariants may not be defined, i.e., for which \bar{S} may

carefully choosing the fundamental class of the intersection of \bar{S} and its
slight perturbation in M. Surprisingly, for certain singularity types such an
invariant is well-define (and not trivial) despite the fact that \bar{S} does
not possess the fundamental class.

coupling the tidal and gravothermal evolution of the planet. Contrarily to
previous similar studies, our calculations are based on the complete tidal
evolution equations of the Hut model, valid at any order in eccentricity,
obliquity and spin. We demonstrate, both analytically and numerically, that,
except if the system was formed with a nearly circular orbit (e<0.2), solving
consistently the complete tidal equations is mandatory to derive correct tidal
evolution histories. We show that calculations based on tidal models truncated
at second order in eccentricity, as done in all previous studies, lead to
erroneous tidal evolutions. As a consequence, tidal energy dissipation rates
are severely underestimated in all these calculations and the characteristic
timescales for the various orbital parameters evolutions can be wrong by up to
three orders in magnitude.
  Based on these complete, consistent calculations, we revisit the viability of
the tidal heating hypothesis to explain the anomalously large radius of
transiting giant planets. We show that, even though tidal dissipation does
provide a substantial contribution to the planet's heat budget and can explain
some of the moderately bloated hot-Jupiters, this mechanism can not explain
alone the properties of the most inflated objects, including HD 209458b.
Indeed, solving the complete tidal equations shows that enhanced tidal
dissipation and thus orbit circularization occur too early during the planet's
evolution to provide enough extra energy at the present epoch. In that case
another mechanisms, such as stellar irradiation induced surface winds
dissipating in the planet's tidal bulges, or inefficient convection in the
planet's interior must be invoked, together with tidal dissipation, to provide
all the pieces of the abnormally large exoplanet puzzle.

four-dimensional manifold times a finite space. A new tensorial notation is
developed to present the various constructs of noncommutative geometry. In
particular, this notation is used to determine the spectral data of the
standard model. The particle spectrum with all of its symmetries is derived,
almost uniquely, under the assumption of irreducibility and of dimension 6
modulo 8 for the finite space. The reduction from the natural symmetry group
SU(2)xSU(2)xSU(4) to U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3) is a consequence of the hypothesis that
the two layers of space-time are finite distance apart but is non-dynamical.
The square of the Dirac operator, and all geometrical invariants that appear in
the calculation of the heat kernel expansion are evaluated. We re-derive the
leading order terms in the spectral action. The geometrical action yields
unification of all fundamental interactions including gravity at very high
energies. We make the following predictions: (i) The number of fermions per
family is 16. (ii) The symmetry group is U(1)xSU(2)xSU(3). (iii) There are
quarks and leptons in the correct representations. (iv) There is a doublet
Higgs that breaks the electroweak symmetry to U(1). (v) Top quark mass of
170-175 Gev. (v) There is a right-handed neutrino with a see-saw mechanism.
Moreover, the zeroth order spectral action obtained with a cut-off function is
consistent with experimental data up to few percent. We discuss a number of
open issues. We prepare the ground for computing higher order corrections since
the predicted mass of the Higgs field is quite sensitive to the higher order
corrections. We speculate on the nature of the noncommutative space at
Planckian energies and the possible role of the fundamental group for the
problem of generations.

Besides the usual energetic terms for bending, surface area, and pressure

exerted by proteins and for an entropic contribution due to many dimensions
worth of shapes available at a given energy.
  In order to test the model, we measured the structural features of
mitochondria in HeLa cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts using 3D electron
tomography. Such tomograms reveal that the inner membrane self-assembles into a
complex structure that contains both tubular and flat lamellar crista
components. This structure, which contains one matrix compartment, is believed
to be essential to the proper functioning of mitochondria as the powerhouse of
the cell. We find that tensile forces of the order of 10 pN are required to
stabilize a stress-induced coexistence of tubular and flat lamellar cristae
phases. The model also predicts \Deltap = -0.036 \pm 0.004 atm and \sigma=0.09

providers into the wireless domain. While most of these companies already offer
wireless products for measurement and monitoring purposes, the ultimate goal is
to be able to close feedback loops over wireless networks interconnecting
sensors, computation devices, and actuators. In this paper we present a
decentralized event-triggered implementation, over sensor/actuator networks, of
centralized nonlinear controllers. Event-triggered control has been recently
proposed as an alternative to the more traditional periodic execution of
control tasks. In a typical event-triggered implementation, the control signals
are kept constant until the violation of a condition on the state of the plant
triggers the re-computation of the control signals. The possibility of reducing
the number of re-computations, and thus of transmissions, while guaranteeing
desired levels of performance makes event-triggered control very appealing in
the context of sensor/actuator networks. In these systems the communication
network is a shared resource and event-triggered implementations of control
laws offer a flexible way to reduce network utilization. Moreover reducing the
number of times that a feedback control law is executed implies a reduction in
transmissions and thus a reduction in energy expenditures of battery powered
wireless sensor nodes.

exponents (quasi-limit-)dominates the sum of Oseledec spaces corresponding to
positive Lyapunov exponents at $x$. We generalize a certain of results of Pesin
theory from $C^{1+\alpha}$ to the $C^1$ system $ (f,\mu)$, including a
sufficient condition for existence of horseshoe, Livshitz theorem, exponential
growth of periodic points, distribution of periodic points, periodic measures,
horseshoes, nonuniform specification and lower semi-continuity of entropy
function etc. In particular, they are applied for $C^1$ partially hyperbolic
systems whose central bundle displays some non-uniform hyperbolicity, including
some robust systems. Moreover, for some $C^1$ partially hyperbolic (not
necessarily volume-preserving) systems, we get some information of Lebesgue
measure on Average-nonuniform hyperbolicityand volume-non-expanding.
  A constructed machinery is developed for $C^1$ (not necessarily
$C^{1+\alpha}$) diffeomorphisms: new Pesin blocks is established topologically
(independent on measures) such that every block has stable manifold theorem and
simultaneously has exponential shadowing. The new construction, different with
classical $C^{1+\alpha}$ ones, is mainly inspired from Liao's
quasi-hyperbolicity and so here we call new blocks by Liao-Pesin blocks and
call the new established $C^1$ Pesin theory by $C^1$ Liao-Pesin Theory.
Liao-Pesin set not only exists for invariant measures, but also exists for
general probability measures, for example, Lebesgue measure (not assuming
invariant) in some partially hyperbolic systems.

pulsar orbits a massive star. The pulsar wind is contained by the stellar wind
of the O or Be companion, creating a relativistic comet-like structure
accompanying the pulsar along its orbit. The X-ray and the very high energy
(>100 GeV, VHE) gamma-ray emissions from the binary LS 5039 are modulated on
the orbital period of the system. Maximum and minimum flux occur at the
conjunctions of the orbit, suggesting that the explanation is linked to the
orbital geometry. The VHE modulation has been proposed to be due to the
combined effect of Compton scattering and pair production on stellar photons,
both of which depend on orbital phase. The X-ray modulation could be due to
relativistic Doppler boosting in the comet tail where both the X-ray and VHE
photons would be emitted. Relativistic aberrations change the seed stellar
photon flux in the comoving frame so Doppler boosting affects synchrotron and
inverse Compton emission differently. The dependence with orbital phase of
relativistic Doppler-boosted (isotropic) synchrotron and (anisotropic) inverse
Compton emission is calculated, assuming that the flow is oriented radially
away from the star (LS 5039) or tangentially to the orbit (LS I +61 303, PSR
B1259-63). Doppler boosting of the synchrotron emission in LS 5039 produces a
lightcurve whose shape corresponds to the X-ray modulation. The observations
imply an outflow velocity of 0.15-0.33c consistent with the expected flow speed
at the pulsar wind termination shock. In LS I +61 303, the calculated Doppler
boosted emission peaks in phase with the observed VHE and X-ray maximum.
Doppler boosting might provide an explanation for the puzzling phasing of the
