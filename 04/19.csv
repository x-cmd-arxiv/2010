client and a server share a low entropic password while the server additionally
owns a high entropic secret for a public key. There are simple solutions for
this (e.g. Halevi and Krawczyk (ACM TISSEC 1999) and its improvement by
Boyarsky (CCS 1999)). In this paper, we consider a new threat to this type of
protocol: if a server's high entropic secret gets compromised (e.g., due to
cryptanalysis, virus attack or a poor management), the adversary might {\em
quickly} break lots of passwords and cause uncountable damage. In this case,
one should not expect the protocol to be secure against an off-line dictionary
attack since, otherwise, the protocol is in fact a secure password-only key
exchange where the server also only has a password (by making the server high
entropic secret public). Of course a password-only key exchange does not suffer
from this threat as the server does not have a high entropic secret at all.
However, known password-only key exchange are not very efficient (note: we only
consider protocols without random oracles). This motivates us to study
efficient and secure asymmetric password key exchange that avoids the new
threat. In this paper, we first provide a formal model for the new threat,
where essentially we require that the active adversary can break $\ell$
passwords in $\alpha\ell |{\cal D}|$ steps (for $\alpha<1/2$) only with a
probability negligibly close to $\exp(-\beta\ell)$ for some $\beta>0$. Then, we
construct a framework of asymmetric password based key exchange. We prove that
our protocol is secure in the usual sense. We also show that it prevents the
new threat. To do this, we introduce a new technique by abstracting a
probabilistic experiment from the main proof and providing a neat analysis of
it.

The scope is general and treats the case of rough coefficients, i.e.

non-separated length scales. The approach taken here is based on the the
generalized finite element method (GFEM) introduced in \cite{107}, and
elaborated in \cite{102}, \cite{103} and \cite{104}. The GFEM is constructed by
partitioning the computational domain $\Omega$ into to a collection of
preselected subsets $\omega_{i},i=1,2,..m$ and constructing finite dimensional
approximation spaces $\Psi_{i}$ over each subset using local information. The
notion of the Kolmogorov $n$-width is used to identify the optimal local
approximation spaces. These spaces deliver local approximations with errors
that decay almost exponentially with the degrees of freedom $N_{i}$ in the
energy norm over $\omega_i$. The local spaces $% \Psi_{i}$ are used within the
GFEM scheme to produce a finite dimensional subspace $S^N$ of $H^{1}(\Omega)$
which is then employed in the Galerkin method. It is shown that the error in
the Galerkin approximation decays in the energy norm almost exponentially
(i.e., super-algebraicly) with respect to the degrees of freedom $N$. When
length scales ""`separate"" and the microstructure is sufficiently fine with
respect to the length scale of the domain $\omega_i$ it is shown that
homogenization theory can be used to construct local approximation spaces with
exponentially decreasing error in the pre-asymtotic regime.

quiet Sun and active regions. This code is a tool for modeling the variability
of the solar irradiance and understanding its influence on Earth. Methods. We
exploit further development of the radiative transfer code COSI that now
incorporates the calculation of molecular lines. We validated COSI under the
conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) against the synthetic
spectra calculated with the ATLAS code. The synthetic solar spectra were also
calculated in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) and compared to the
available measured spectra. In doing so we have defined the main problems of
the modeling, e.g., the lack of opacity in the UV part of the spectrum and the
inconsistency in the calculations of the visible continuum level, and we
describe a solution to these problems. Results. The improved version of COSI
allows us to reach good agreement between the calculated and observed solar
spectra as measured by SOLSTICE and SIM onboard the SORCE satellite and ATLAS 3
mission operated from the Space Shuttle. We find that NLTE effects are very
important for the modeling of the solar spectrum even in the visual part of the

the strong effect on the UV part of the spectrum, NLTE effects influence the
concentration of the negative ion of hydrogen, which results in a significant
change of the visible continuum level and the irradiance variability.

a set of paths (the drivers), each one with its own budget. For a given
assignment of edge weights (the tolls), the highway owner collects from each
driver the weight of the associated path, when it does not exceed the budget of
the driver, and zero otherwise. The goal is choosing weights so as to maximize
the profit.
  A lot of research has been devoted to this apparently simple problem. The
highway problem was shown to be strongly NP-hard only recently
[Elbassioni,Raman,Ray-'09]. The best-known approximation is O(\log n/\log\log
n) [Gamzu,Segev-'10], which improves on the previous-best O(\log n)
approximation [Balcan,Blum-'06].
  In this paper we present a PTAS for the highway problem, hence closing the
complexity status of the problem. Our result is based on a novel randomized
dissection approach, which has some points in common with Arora's quadtree
dissection for Euclidean network design [Arora-'98]. The basic idea is
enclosing the highway in a bounding path, such that both the size of the
bounding path and the position of the highway in it are random variables. Then
we consider a recursive O(1)-ary dissection of the bounding path, in subpaths
of uniform optimal weight. Since the optimal weights are unknown, we construct
the dissection in a bottom-up fashion via dynamic programming, while computing
the approximate solution at the same time. Our algorithm can be easily
derandomized. We demonstrate the versatility of our technique by presenting
PTASs for two variants of the highway problem: the tollbooth problem with a
constant number of leaves and the maximum-feasibility subsystem problem on
interval matrices. In both cases the previous best approximation factors are
polylogarithmic [Gamzu,Segev-'10,Elbassioni,Raman,Ray,Sitters-'09].

N_f=4 critical exponents from the respective Gross Neveu ones, hint at evidence
for non-zero fermion mass generated by the gauge fields dynamics that might
have been enhanced by the four-fermi coupling. It is also shown that the
scaling region is suppressed at weak four-fermi couplings and large N_f values.
Measurements of i) a monopole susceptibility which is the polarizability of the
monopole configurations, and ii) the density of isolated monopoles, imply that
for $N_f \ge 1$ and weak gauge couplings the monopoles do not affect the
theory's confining properties, because they are shielded.

is in plane, this leads to a linear term in the spin wave dispersion relation
for propagation across the magnetization. The dispersion relation thus assumes
a form similar to that of an energy band of an electron trapped on a
semiconductor surfaces with Rashba coupling active. We also show SPEELS
response functions that illustrate the role of spin orbit coupling in such

spin waves, the presence of spin orbit coupling in the W substrate leads to a
substantial increase in the linewidth of the spin wave modes. The formalism we

continuous period increase. The period and semi-amplitude of the oscillation
are about 21.6 yrs and 0.0133 d, respectively. This detail is interpreted as a
light-travel-time effect due to a low-luminosity K-type star gravitationally
bound to the CL Aur close system. Our photometric study indicates that CL Aur

a gas stream impact on the hot star is more reasonable despite two difficulties
with the explanation. Absolute dimensions of the eclipsing system are deduced

In this case, the MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) algorithm, originally

MUSIC fails, and in practice none of the existing methods can consistently

which improves on MUSIC so that the support is reliably recovered under such

proposed and analyzed in this paper, SA-MUSIC provides a computationally
efficient algorithm with a performance guarantee. The performance guarantees
are given in terms of a version of restricted isometry property. In particular,

the two main QCD phase transitions, confinement and chiral symmetry breaking.
Confinement drives chiral symmetry breaking, and, due to the finite quark mass,
at small density both transitions are a crossover, while they are a first or
second order phase transition in large density. We study the QCD phase diagram
with a quark potential model including both confinement and chiral symmetry.
This formalism, in the Coulomb gauge hamiltonian formalism of QCD, is presently
the only one able to microscopically include both a quark-antiquark confining
potential and a vacuum condensate of quark-antiquark pairs. This model is able
to address all the excited hadrons, and chiral symmetry breaking, at the same
token. Our order parameters are the Polyakov loop and the quark mass gap. The
confining potential is extracted from the Lattice QCD data of the Bielefeld
group. We address how the quark masses affect the critical point location in
the phase diagram.

use a recently proposed parameterization of the growth index that interpolates
between a constant value at high redshifts and a form that accounts for
redshift dependencies at small redshifts. We also suggest here another
exponential parameterization with a similar behaviour. The redshift dependent
parametrizations provide a sub-percent precision level to the numerical growth
function, for the full redshift range. Using these redshift parameterizations
or a constant growth index, we find that current available data from galaxy
redshift distortions and Lyman-alpha forests is unable to put significant
constraints on any of the growth parameters. For example both $\Lambda$CDM and
flat DGP are allowed by current growth data. We use an MCMC analysis to study
constraints from future growth data, and simulate pessimistic and moderate
scenarios for the uncertainties. In both scenarios, the redshift
parameterizations discussed are able to provide significant constraints and
rule out models when incorrectly assumed in the analysis. The values taken by
the constant part of the parameterizations as well as the redshift slopes are
all found to significantly rule out an incorrect background. We also find that,
for our pessimistic scenario, an assumed constant growth index over the full
redshift range is unable to rule out incorrect models in all cases. This is due
to the fact that the slope acts as a second discriminator at smaller redshifts
and therefore provide a significant test to identify the underlying gravity
theory.

Aquarius haloes, (2) an empirical Milky-Way globular cluster population and (3)
satellite streams (diffuse dark component) identified in the simulations.
Accounting for these extra components, we confirm our earlier conclusion that
the abundance of intrinsic substructures (dark or bright, bound or diffuse) is
not sufficient to explain the observed frequency of cusp-caustic violations in
the CLASS survey. We conclude that the observed effect could be the result of
the small number statistics of CLASS, or intergalactic haloes along the line of
sight acting as additional sources of lensing flux anomalies. Another
possibility is that this discrepancy signals a failure of the CDM model.

power variation. The period of power variation and wavelength shifts of
subsideband can be changed by altering the linear cavity phase delay. It is
also found that the periodic power variation is caused by the interaction
between the nonuniform polarization state of the circulating light and the
polarizer in the laser cavity.

the frequency and the momentum exhibits cusps and nonmonotonic structures. The

of the particle distribution function. The model is calibrated by fitting the
calculated spectrum to the observations of the Crab Nebula at an age of a
thousand years. The spectral evolution of the Crab Nebula in our model shows
that the flux ratio of TeV gamma-rays to X-rays increases with time, which
implies that old PWNe are faint in X-rays, but not in TeV gamma-rays. The
increase of this ratio is because the magnetic field decreases with time and is
not because the X-ray emitting particles are cooled more rapidly than the TeV
gamma-ray emitting particles. Our spectral evolution model matches the observed
rate of the radio flux decrease of the Crab Nebula. This result implies that
our magnetic field evolution model is close to the reality. Finally, from the
viewpoint of the spectral evolution, only a small fraction of the injected
energy from the Crab Pulsar needs to go to the magnetic field, which is
consistent with previous studies.

of growth catalyst in a chemical vapor deposition process. Densities of CNTs
ranging from 0.02 CNTs/{\mu}m^2 to 1.29 CNTs/{\mu}m^2 are obtained. The
resulting pristine CNT thin films are then successfully patterned using either
pre-growth or post-growth techniques. By developing a layered photoresist

improvements over popular pre-growth patterning methods are obtained.
Limitations of traditional post-growth patterning methods are circumvented by
selective transfer printing of CNTs with either thermoplastic or metallic
stamps. Resulting as-grown patterns of CNT thin films have edge roughness (< 1
{\mu}m) and resolution (< 5 {\mu}m) comparable to standard photolithography.
Bottom gate CNT thin film devices are fabricated with field-effect mobilities
up to 20 cm^2/Vs and on/off ratios of the order of 10^3. The patterning and

first step to apply it to the backlog and delay analysis of an 802.11 wireless
local network. In particular, we address the following questions: In applying
stochastic network calculus, under what situations can we derive stable backlog
and delay bounds? How to derive the backlog and delay bounds of an 802.11
wireless node? And how tight are these bounds when compared with simulations?
To answer these questions, we first derive the general stability condition of a
wireless node (not restricted to 802.11). From this, we give the specific
stability condition of an 802.11 wireless node. Then we derive the backlog and
delay bounds of an 802.11 node based on an existing model of 802.11. We observe
that the derived bounds are loose when compared with ns-2 simulations,
indicating that improvements are needed in the current version of stochastic

finite-temperature spin-glass transition, which implies the existence of the
zero-temperature phase transition in the system. A notable tendency of
hierarchical lattices is that the zeros spread in a wide region of the complex
$y$ plane in comparison with the case of Cayley trees, which may reflect the
difference between the mean-field and finite-dimensional systems.

by several thousands of main-belt asteroids. The ring is first studied in an
analytical framework that provides an estimate of all the ring's parameters
excepting mass. In the second part, numerically estimated perturbations on the
Earth-Mars, Earth-Venus, and Earth-Mercury distances induced by various subsets
of the main-belt population are compared with perturbations induced by a ring.
To account for large uncertainties in the asteroid masses, we obtain results
from Monte Carlo experiments based on asteroid masses randomly generated
according to available data and the statistical asteroid model. The radius of
the ring is analytically estimated at 2.8 AU. A systematic comparison of the
ring with subsets of the main belt shows that, after removing the 300 most
perturbing asteroids, the total main-belt perturbation of the Earth-Mars
distance reaches on average 246 m on the 1969-2010 time interval. A ring with
appropriate mass is able to reduce this effect to 38 m. We show that, by
removing from the main belt ~240 asteroids that are not necessarily the most
perturbing ones, the corresponding total perturbation reaches on average 472 m,
but the ring is able to reduce it down to a few meters, thus accounting for
more than 99% of the total effect.

of spacetime, and causal sets have been proposed as discrete models of the
latter in the context of quantum gravity theories, notably in the Causal Set
Programme. In the rather different context of what might be called the
'Computational Universe Programme' -- one which associates the complexity of
physical phenomena to the emergent features of models such as cellular automata
-- a choice problem arises with respect to the variety of formal systems that,
in virtue of their computational universality (Turing-completeness), qualify as
equally good candidates for a computational, unified theory of physics. This
paper proposes Causal Sets as the only objects of physical significance and
relevance to be considered under the 'computational universe' perspective, and
as the appropriate abstraction for shielding the unessential details of the
many different computationally universal candidate models. At the same time, we
propose a fully deterministic, radical alternative to the probabilistic
techniques currently considered in the Causal Set Programme for growing
discrete spacetimes. We investigate a number of computation models by grouping
them into two broad classes, based on the support on which they operate; in one
case this is linear, like a tape or a string of symbols; in the other, it is a
two-dimensional grid or a planar graph. For each model we identify the
causality relation among computation events, implement it, and conduct a
possibly exhaustive exploration of the associated causal set space, while
examining quantitative and qualitative features such as dimensionality,
curvature, planarity, emergence of pseudo-randomness, causal set substructures
and particles.

genetic algorithm approach to multiple-choice optimisation problems.It shows
that such information can significantly enhance performance, but that the
choice of information and the way it is included are important factors for
success.Two multiple-choice problems are considered.The first is constructing a
feasible nurse roster that considers as many requests as possible.In the second
problem, shops are allocated to locations in a mall subject to constraints and
maximising the overall income.Genetic algorithms are chosen for their
well-known robustness and ability to solve large and complex discrete
optimisation problems.However, a survey of the literature reveals room for
further research into generic ways to include constraints into a genetic
algorithm framework.Hence, the main theme of this work is to balance
feasibility and cost of solutions.In particular, co-operative co-evolution with
hierarchical sub-populations, problem structure exploiting repair schemes and
indirect genetic algorithms with self-adjusting decoder functions are
identified as promising approaches.The research starts by applying standard
genetic algorithms to the problems and explaining the failure of such
approaches due to epistasis.To overcome this, problem-specific information is
added in a variety of ways, some of which are designed to increase the number
of feasible solutions found whilst others are intended to improve the quality
of such solutions.As well as a theoretical discussion as to the underlying
reasons for using each operator,extensive computational experiments are carried
out on a variety of data.These show that the indirect approach relies less on
problem structure and hence is easier to implement and superior in solution
quality.

originates in the early 1960s and has recently attracted fresh support from
quantitative studies of large scale, real-life networks. Here we investigate
the hierarchical modular (or ""modules-within-modules"") decomposition of human
brain functional networks, measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) in 18 healthy volunteers under no-task or resting conditions. We used a
customized template to extract networks with more than 1800 regional nodes, and
we applied a fast algorithm to identify nested modular structure at several
hierarchical levels. We used mutual information, 0 < I < 1, to estimate the
similarity of community structure of networks in different subjects, and to
identify the individual network that is most representative of the group.
Results show that human brain functional networks have a hierarchical modular
organization with a fair degree of similarity between subjects, I=0.63. The
largest 5 modules at the highest level of the hierarchy were medial occipital,
lateral occipital, central, parieto-frontal and fronto-temporal systems;
occipital modules demonstrated less sub-modular organization than modules
comprising regions of multimodal association cortex. Connector nodes and hubs,
with a key role in inter-modular connectivity, were also concentrated in
association cortical areas. We conclude that methods are available for
hierarchical modular decomposition of large numbers of high resolution brain
functional networks using computationally expedient algorithms. This could
enable future investigations of Simon's original hypothesis that hierarchy or
near-decomposability of physical symbol systems is a critical design feature
for their fast adaptivity to changing environmental conditions.

relations for the metal-rich bulge clusters and the metal-poor halo clusters.
Methods. The photometric RGB shape indices such as colors at fixed magnitudes
of MK = MH = (-5.5, -5, -4, and -3), magnitudes at fixed colors of (J - K)o =
(J - H)o = 0.7, and the RGB slope are measured from the fiducial normal points
defined in the near- infrared color-magnitude diagrams for each cluster. The
magnitudes of RGB bump and tip are also estimated from the differential and
cumulative luminosity functions of the selected RGB stars. The derived RGB
parameters have been used to examine the overall behaviors of the RGB
morphology as a function of cluster metallicity. Results. The correlations

population, in which molecular alterations can be somatically inherited by
genetic, epigenetic or extragenetic transmission processes, leading to a
cooperation of neoplastic cells within tumoral tissue. The efflux protein
P-glycoprotein (P gp) is overexpressed in many cancer cells and has known
capacity to confer multidrug resistance to cytotoxic therapies. Recently,
cell-to-cell P-gp transfers have been shown. Herein, we combine experimental
evidence and a mathematical model to examine the consequences of an
intercellular P-gp trafficking in the extragenetic transfer of multidrug
resistance from resistant to sensitive cell subpopulations. We report
cell-to-cell transfers of functional P-gp in co-cultures of a P-gp
overexpressing human breast cancer MCF-7 cell variant, selected for its
resistance towards doxorubicin, with the parental sensitive cell line. We found
that P-gp as well as efflux activity distribution are progressively reorganized
over time in co-cultures analyzed by flow cytometry. A mathematical model based
on a Boltzmann type integro-partial differential equation structured by a
continuum variable corresponding to P-gp activity describes the cell
populations in co-culture. The mathematical model elucidates the population
elements in the experimental data, specifically, the initial proportions, the
proliferative growth rates, and the transfer rates of P-gp in the sensitive and
resistant subpopulations. We confirmed cell-to-cell transfer of functional
P-gp. The transfer process depends on the gradient of P-gp expression in the
donor-recipient cell interactions, as they evolve over time. Extragenetically
acquired drug resistance is an additional aptitude of neoplastic cells which
has implications in the diagnostic value of P-gp expression and in the design
of chemotherapy regimens

last several years. Small sensors powered by miniaturized microprocessors are
capable of supporting several applications for civil and military domains.
Determining the location of sensors is a basic and essential knowledge for most
WSN algorithms and protocols including data tagging, routing, node
identification, among others. This paper surveys the different algorithms that
have been proposed to securely determine the location of a sensor node. By
""secure"", we mean that adversaries cannot easily affect the accuracy of the
localized sensors. In other words, the localization algorithm must be robust
under several attacks. We provide a taxonomy for classifying different secure
localization schemes and describe possible attacks that can harm localization.
In addition, we survey different secure localization schemes and show how they
map to the proposed taxonomy. We also give a comparison between the different
schemes, showing the attacks addressed by each.

recognizes whether an expression over two types of parenthesis is
well-parenthesized. This proves a conjecture due to Magniez, Mathieu, and Nayak
(2009) and rigorously establishes that bidirectional streams are exponentially
more efficient in space usage as compared with unidirectional ones. We obtain
the lower bound by establishing the minimum amount of information that is
necessarily revealed by the players about their respective inputs in a
two-party communication protocol for a variant of the Index function, namely
Augmented Index. The information cost trade-off is obtained by a novel
application of the conceptually simple and familiar ideas such as average
encoding and the cut-and-paste property of randomized protocols.
  Motivated by recent examples of exponential savings in space by streaming
quantum algorithms, we also study quantum protocols for Augmented Index.
Defining an appropriate notion of information cost for quantum protocols
involves a delicate balancing act between its applicability and the ease with
which we can analyze it. We define a notion of quantum information cost which
reflects some of the non-intuitive properties of quantum information and give a
trade-off for this notion. While this trade-off demonstrates the strength of
our proof techniques, it does not lead to a space lower bound for checking
parentheses. We leave such an implication for quantum streaming algorithms as
an intriguing open question.

many-body quantum systems may exhibit phase transitions even at zero
temperature. Quantum fluctuations, deeply rooted in Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle, and not thermal fluctuations, drive the system from one phase to
another. Typically, the relative strength of two competing terms in the
system's Hamiltonian is changed across a finite critical value. A well-known
example is the Mott-Hubbard quantum phase transition from a superfluid to an
insulating phase, which has been observed for weakly interacting bosonic atomic
gases. However, for strongly interacting quantum systems confined to
lower-dimensional geometry a novel type of quantum phase transition may be
induced for which an arbitrarily weak perturbation to the Hamiltonian is
sufficient to drive the transition. Here, for a one-dimensional (1D) quantum
gas of bosonic caesium atoms with tunable interactions, we observe the
commensurate-incommensurate quantum phase transition from a superfluid
Luttinger liquid to a Mott-insulator. For sufficiently strong interactions, the
transition is induced by adding an arbitrarily weak optical lattice
commensurate with the atomic granularity, which leads to immediate pinning of
the atoms. We map out the phase diagram and find that our measurements in the
strongly interacting regime agree well with a quantum field description based
on the exactly solvable sine-Gordon model. We trace the phase boundary all the
way to the weakly interacting regime where we find good agreement with the
predictions of the 1D Bose-Hubbard model. Our results open up the experimental
study of quantum phase transitions, criticality, and transport phenomena beyond
Hubbard-type models in the context of ultracold gases.

nonclassicality (or quantumness) of multimode (or multiparty) bosonic fields

new ones. The nonclassicality criteria are based on Vogel's criterion
corresponding to analyzing the positivity of multimode P functions or,
equivalently, the positivity of matrices of expectation values of, e.g.,
creation and annihilation operators. We analyze not only monomials, but also
polynomial functions of such moments, which can sometimes enable simpler
derivations of physically relevant inequalities. As an example, we derive
various classical inequalities which can be violated only by nonclassical
fields. In particular, we show how the criteria introduced here easily reduce
to the well-known inequalities describing: (a) multimode quadrature squeezing
and its generalizations including sum, difference and principal squeezing, (b)
two-mode one-time photon-number correlations including sub-Poisson
photon-number correlations and effects corresponding to violations of the
Cauchy-Schwarz and Muirhead inequalities, (c) two-time single-mode
photon-number correlations including photon antibunching and hyperbunching, and
(d) two- and three-mode quantum entanglement. Other simple inequalities for
testing nonclassicality are also proposed. We have found some general relations
between the nonclassicality and entanglement criteria, in particular, those
resulting from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. It is shown that some known
entanglement inequalities can be derived as nonclassicality inequalities within
our formalism, while some other known entanglement inequalities can be seen as
sums of more than one inequality derived from the nonclassicality criterion.
This approach enables a deeper analysis of the entanglement for a given
nonclassicality.

frequency, temperature, thermal cycling and grain coupling significantly
influence the real and especially imaginary parts of the ac susceptibility. We
argue that the cooperative depinning of the domain walls from the
grain-boundaries accompanying with a large distance movements of the walls
leads to the appearance of an anomaly at low temperatures. The anomaly is
observed above a threshold ac field and depends on the intergrain coupling. The
results show that in the powdered form of bulk samples, the anomaly disappears
and the ac field dependence of the $\chi'$ and $\chi""$ suppresses. Below the
anomaly temperature, significant and unusual thermal hysteresis occurs in the
real and especially imaginary parts of the ac susceptibility. Thermal
hysteresis depends on the thermal cycling and indicates thermally irreversible
wall pinning and depinning. The susceptibility is practically
frequency-independent in the temperature range of thermal hysteresis i.e. below
the anomaly. The frequency dependence of ac susceptibility between the anomaly
temperature and the transition temperature is discussed by considering the
temperature dependence of the relaxation process of the domain walls.

  potential",,,"10.1063/1.3463424",,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  By molecular dynamic simulations we study a system of particles interacting
through a continuous isotropic pairwise core-softened potential consisting of a
repulsive shoulder and an attractive well. The model displays a phase diagram
with three fluid phases, a gas-liquid critical point, a liquid-liquid critical
point, and anomalies in density, diffusion and structure. The hierarchy of the
anomalies is the same as for water. We study the effect on the anomalies of
varying the softness of the potential. We find that, making the soft-core
steeper, the regions of density and diffusion anomalies contract in the T -
{\rho} plane, while the region of structural anomaly is weakly affected.
Therefore, a liquid can have anomalous structural behavior without density or
diffusion anomalies. We show that, by considering as effective distances those
corresponding to the maxima of the first two peaks of the radial distribution
function g(r) in the high-density liquid, we can generalize to continuous
two-scales potentials a criterion for the occurrence of the anomalies of
density and diffusion, originally proposed for discontinuous potentials. We
observe that the knowledge of the structural behavior within the first two
coordination shells of the liquid is not enough to establish the occurrence of
the anomalies. By introducing the density derivative of the the cumulative
order integral of the excess entropy we show that the anomalous behavior is
regulated by the structural order at distances as large as the fourth
coordination shell. By comparing the results for different softness of the
potential, we conclude that the disappearing of the density and diffusion
anomalies for the steeper potentials is due to a more structured short-range
order. All these results increase our understanding on how, knowing the
interaction potential, we can evaluate the possible presence of anomalies for a
liquid.

properties of all cases in the bilinear formalism. An exact symmetry implies CP
conservation. We show that soft breaking of the symmetry can lead to
spontaneous CP violation (CPV) in three of the classes.

In this paper, we use the 3D self-consistent annular gap model to study light
curves for both young and millisecond pulsars observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope. The annular gap can generate high energy emission for
short-period pulsars. The annular gap regions are so large that they have
enough electric potential drop to accelerate charged particles to produce
gamma-ray photons. For young pulsars, the emission region is from the neutron
star surface to about half of the light cylinder radius, and the peak
emissivity is in the vicinity of the null charge surface. The emission region
for the millisecond pulsars is located much lower than that of the young
pulsars. The higher energy gamma-ray emission comes from higher altitudes in
the magnetosphere. We present the simulated light curves for three young
pulsars (the Crab, the Vela, the Geminga) and three millisecond pulsars (PSR
J0030+0451, PSR J0218+4232, PSR J0437-3715) using the annular gap model. Our

investigated. The $N$ spins in the chain interact with their nearest neighbours
with a coupling constant proportional to the oscillator position and to
$N^{-1/2}$, are in contact with a thermal bath at temperature $T$, and evolve
under Glauber dynamics. The oscillator position is a stochastic process due to
the oscillator-spin interaction which produces drastic changes in the
equilibrium behaviour and the dynamics of the oscillator. Firstly, there is a
second order phase transition at a critical temperature $T_c$ whose order
parameter is the oscillator stable rest position: this position is zero above
$T_c$ and different from zero below $T_c$. This transition appears because the
oscillator moves in an effective potential equal to the harmonic term plus the
free energy of the spin system at fixed oscillator position. Secondly, assuming
fast spin relaxation (compared to the oscillator natural period), the
oscillator dynamical behaviour is described by an effective equation containing
a nonlinear friction term that drives the oscillator towards the stable
equilibrium state of the effective potential. The analytical results are
compared with numerical simulation throughout the paper.

matter substructures in the halos of Milky Way sized galaxies, yet the number
of known luminous satellites galaxies is very much smaller, a discrepancy that
has become known as the `missing satellite problem'. The most massive
substructures have been shown to be plausibly the hosts of the brightest
satellites, but it remains unclear which processes prevent star formation in
the many other, purely dark substructures. We use high-resolution hydrodynamic
simulations of the formation of Milky Way sized galaxies in order to test how
well such self-consistent models of structure formation match the observed
properties of the Galaxy's satellite population. For the first time, we include
in such calculations feedback from cosmic rays injected into the star forming
gas by supernovae as well as the energy input from supermassive black holes
growing at the Milky Way's centre and its progenitor systems. We find that
non-thermal particle populations quite strongly suppress the star formation
efficiency of the smallest galaxies. In fact, our cosmic ray model is able to
reproduce the observed faint-end of the satellite luminosity function, while
models that include only the effects of cosmic reionization, or galactic winds,
do significantly worse. Our simulated satellite population approximately
matches available kinematic data on the satellites and their observed spatial
distribution. We conclude that a proper resolution of the missing satellite
problem likely requires the inclusion of non-standard physics for regulating
star formation in the smallest halos, and that cosmic reionization alone may
not be sufficient.

subposet that is isomorphic to 2+2, the union of two disjoint 2-element chains.
Let $p_n$ denote the number of (2+2)-free posets of size $n$. In a recent
paper, Bousquet-M\'elou et al.\cite{BCDK} found, using so called ascent
sequences, the generating function for the number of (2+2)-free posets of size
$n$: $P(t)=\sum_{n \geq 0} p_n t^n = \sum_{n\geq 0} \prod_{i=1}^{n}
(1-(1-t)^i)$. We extend this result in two ways. First, we find the generating
function for (2+2)-free posets when four statistics are taken into account, one
of which is the number of minimal elements in a poset. Second, we show that if
$p_{n,k}$ equals the number of (2+2)-free posets of size $n$ with $k$ minimal
elements, then $P(t,z)=\sum_{n,k \geq 0} p_{n,k} t^n z^k = 1+ \sum_{n \geq 0}
\frac{zt}{(1-zt)^{n+1}} \prod_{i=1}^n (1-(1-t)^i)$. The second result cannot be
derived from the first one by a substitution. On the other hand, $P(t)$ can
easily be obtained from $P(t,z)$ thus providing an alternative proof for the
enumeration result in \cite{BCDK}. Moreover, we conjecture a simpler form of
writing $P(t,z)$. Our enumeration results are extended to certain restricted
permutations and to regular linearized chord diagrams through bijections in
\cite{BCDK,cdk}. Finally, we define a subset of ascent sequences counted by the
Catalan numbers and we discuss its relations with (2+2)- and (3+1)-free posets.

corresponding to that for SPC/E water at a pressure of 1 bar. The chemical

tightly bound than water simulated at 300 K with the revPBE functional or at
350 K with the BLYP and BLYP-D functionals. The packing contribution for
various radii of the observation volume is studied. In the size range where the
distribution of water molecules in the observation volume is expected to be
Gaussian, the packing contribution is expected to scale with the volume of the
observation sphere. Water simulated at 300 K with the revPBE and at 350 K with
BLYP-D or BLYP conforms to this expectation, but the results suggest an earlier
onset of system size effects in the BLYP 350 K and revPBE 300 K systems than
that observed for either BLYP-D 350 K or SPC/E. The implication of this
observation for constant pressure simulations is indicated. For water simulated
at 300 K with BLYP, in the size range where Gaussian distribution of occupation
is expected, we instead find non-Gaussian behavior, and the packing
contribution scales with surface area of the observation volume, suggesting the
presence of heterogeneities in the system.

chip surface during experiments. The EIT resonances remain narrow (< 4 MHz) and
the observed widths are independent of atom-surface distance down to ~20 \mum,
indicating relatively long lifetime of the Rydberg states. Our results open the
way to studies of dipolar physics, collective excitations, quantum metrology
and quantum information processing involving interacting Rydberg excited atoms
on atom chips.

theoretical predictions with the multipole power spectrum of the luminous red
galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky survey data release 7. We obtain a
constraint on the Compton wavelength parameter of the f(R) model on the scales

wavelength parameter with a future redshift survey is also investigated. The
usefulness of the redshift-space distortion for testing the gravity theory on
cosmological scales is demonstrated.

  with the same generation properties",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we describe a general, computationally feasible strategy to
deduce a family of interpolatory non-stationary subdivision schemes from a
symmetric non-stationary, non-interpolatory one satisfying quite mild
assumptions. To achieve this result we extend our previous work [C.Conti,
L.Gemignani, L.Romani, Linear Algebra Appl. 431 (2009), no. 10, 1971-1987] to
full generality by removing additional assumptions on the input symbols. For
the so obtained interpolatory schemes we prove that they are capable of
reproducing the same exponential polynomial space as the one generated by the
original approximating scheme. Moreover, we specialize the computational
methods for the case of symbols obtained by shifted non-stationary affine
combinations of exponential B-splines, that are at the basis of most
non-stationary subdivision schemes. In this case we find that the associated
family of interpolatory symbols can be determined to satisfy a suitable set of
generalized interpolating conditions at the set of the zeros (with reversed
signs) of the input symbol. Finally, we discuss some computational examples by
showing that the proposed approach can yield novel smooth non-stationary
interpolatory subdivision schemes possessing very interesting reproduction
properties.

Due to its unusual electronic spectrum with Dirac-like quasiparticles, and the
fact that it is a unique example of a metallic membrane, graphene has
properties that have no match in standard solid state textbooks. In these
lecture notes, I discuss some of these properties that are not covered in
detail in recent reviews. We study the particular aspects of the
physics/chemistry of carbon that influence the properties of graphene; the
basic features of graphene's band structure including the pi and sigma bands;
the phonon spectra in free floating graphene; the effects of a substrate on the
structural properties of graphene; and the effect of deformations in the
propagation of electrons. The objective of these notes is not to provide an
unabridged theoretical description of graphene but to point out some of the
peculiar aspects of this material.
