density wave reconstructed Fermi surface disappear at a critical value of the
doping for YBa2Cu3O6+y, and the cyclotron mass diverges as the critical value
is approached from the high doping side. We argue that the phenomenon is due to
a Lifshitz transition where the pockets giving rise to the quantum oscillations
connect to form an open (quasi-1d) Fermi surface. The estimated critical doping
is close to that found by experiment, and the theory predicts a logarithmic
divergence of the cyclotron mass with a coefficient comparable to that observed
in experiment.

pedagogical introduction to walking technicolor, and more generally to the
physics of extensions of the standard model, makes extensive use of effective
field theory arguments, symmetries and counting rules. The strongly-coupled

development of gauge/gravity dualities provides an ideal set of such

are known to overestimate charge transfer for widely separated atoms, leading
to qualitative errors in the predicted charge distribution and exaggerated
electrostatic properties. We present the charge transfer with polarization
current equilibration (QTPIE) model, which solves this problem by introducing
distance-dependent electronegativities. A graph-theoretic analysis of the
topology of charge transfer allows us to relate the fundamental quantities of
charge transfer back to the more familiar variables that represent atomic
partial charges. This allows us to formulate a unified theoretical framework
for fluctuating-charge models and topological charge descriptors. We also
demonstrate the important role of charge screening effects in obtaining correct
size extensivity in electrostatic properties. Analyzing the spatial symmetries
of these properties allows us to shed light on the role of charge conservation
in the electronegativity equalization process. Finally, we develop a water
model for use in classical molecular dynamics simulations that is capable of
treating both polarization and charge transfer phenomena.

that reduce the expected delay, sometimes at the cost of a reduction in rate
from the NGJV scheme. In particular, we give examples of good schemes for
networks with few users, and show that in large n-user networks, the delay
scales like q^T, where T is quadratic in n for a constant per-user rate and T
is constant for a constant sum-rate. We also show that half the single-user
rate can be achieved while reducing NGJV's delay from q^n^2 to q^(n-1)(n-2).
  This extended version includes complete proofs and more details of good
schemes for small n.

variables of data in the form of a matrix. Often this data is transposable,
meaning that both the row variables and column variables are of potential
interest. An example of this scenario is detecting significant genes in
microarrays when the samples or arrays may be dependent due to underlying
relationships. We study the effect of both row and column correlations on
commonly used test-statistics, null distributions, and multiple testing
procedures, by explicitly modeling the covariances with the matrix-variate
normal distribution. Using this model, we give both theoretical and simulation
results revealing the problems associated with using standard statistical
methodology on transposable data. We solve these problems by estimating the row
and column covariances simultaneously, with transposable regularized covariance
models, and de-correlating or sphering the data as a pre-processing step. Under
reasonable assumptions, our method gives test statistics that follow the scaled
theoretical null distribution and are approximately independent. Simulations
based on various models with structured and observed covariances from real
microarray data reveal that our method offers substantial improvements in two
areas: 1) increased statistical power and 2) correct estimation of false
discovery rates.

reside in symmetries that relate the bosonic Weinberg-Salam Lagrangian with a
higher dimensional generally covariant theory. For this we consider a
three-brane that moves under the influence of a seven dimensional pure Hilbert
Einstein-like generally covariant theory. We introduce a change of variables
that combines the conformal scale of the metric tensor with the brane
fluctuations, so that the conformal scale becomes the modulus and the
fluctuations become the angular field degrees of freedom of a polarly
decomposed Higgs. When we assume that the four dimensional space-time
background of the generally covariant theory is locally conformally flat and
that the internal space is a squashed three-sphere, we arrive at one massless
and three massive vector fields akin those in the Weinberg-Salam model and
recover all the familiar ingredients of the symmetry broken bosonic
Weinberg-Salam model, except that there is no bare Higgs mass. The Higgs mass
is subject to dimensional censorship, its presence is forbidden by general
covariance. This proposes that a resolution to the electroweak hierarchy
problem might well reside in higher dimensions, in a Ward-Takahashi like
identities for general covariance that relate a non-vanishing Higgs mass to
dynamical breaking of general covariance. Moreover, the two electroweak gauge
couplings are both determined by the squashing parameter of the internal three
sphere and when we impose the condition that the vector boson masses must be in
line with custodial symmetry we arrive at the classical level to the Weinberg
angle sin^2 \theta_W = 0.296.

earlier by Bell but without accessible proofs. We define the concept of the
variation of a map on a simple closed curve and relate it to the index of the
map on that curve: Index = Variation + 1. A fixed point theorem for positively
oriented, perfect maps of the plane is obtained. This generalizes results
announced by Bell in 1982. A continuous map of an interval to the real line
which sends the endpoints in opposite directions has a fixed point. We
generalize this to maps on non-invariant continua in the plane under positively
oriented maps of the plane (with appropriate boundary conditions). These
methods imply that in some cases non-invariant continua in the plane are
degenerate. This has important applications in complex dynamics. E.g., a
special case of our results shows that if $X$ is a non-separating invariant
subcontinuum of the Julia set of a polynomial $P$ containing no fixed Cremer
points and exhibiting no local rotation at all fixed points, then $X$ must be a
point. It follows that impressions of some external rays to polynomial Julia
sets are degenerate.

regime. In this paper we propose an experiment to demonstrate these persistent
Rabi oscillations via low-frequency noise correlation. The idea is to measure a
qubit by two detectors, biased stroboscopically at the Rabi frequency. The
low-frequency noise depends on the relative phase between the two combs of
biasing pulses, with a strong increase of telegraph noise in both detectors for
the in-phase or anti-phase combs. This happens because of self-synchronization
between the persistent Rabi oscillations and measurement pulses. Almost perfect
correlation of the noise in the two detectors for the in-phase regime and
almost perfect anticorrelation for the anti-phase regime indicates a presence
of synchronized persistent Rabi oscillations. The experiment can be realized
with semiconductor or superconductor qubits.

as very small density fluctuations in the early universe. The existence of
galaxy clusters and super-clusters suggests that a natural scale for the matter
distribution may not exist. A point of controversy is whether the distribution
is fractal and, if so, over what range of scales. One-dimensional models
demonstrate that the important dynamics for cluster formation occur in the
position-velocity plane. Here the development of scaling behavior and
multifractal geometry is investigated for a family of one-dimensional models
for three different, scale-free, initial conditions. The methodology employed
includes: 1) The derivation of explicit solutions for the gravitational
potential and field for a one-dimensional system with periodic boundary
conditions (Ewald sums for one dimension); 2) The development of a procedure
for obtaining scale-free initial conditions for the growing mode in phase space
for an arbitrary power-law index; 3) The evaluation of power spectra,
correlation functions, and generalized fractal dimensions at different stages
of the system evolution. It is shown that a simple analytic representation of
the power spectra captures the main features of the evolution, including the
correct time dependence of the crossover from the linear to nonlinear regime
and the transition from regular to fractal geometry. A possible physical
mechanism for understanding the self-similar evolution is introduced. It is
shown that hierarchical cluster formation depends both on the model and the
initial power spectrum. Under special circumstances a simple relation between

relativistic mean field (RMF) model with a density dependent coupling that is a
slightly modified form of the original NL3 interaction. For nonuniform nuclear
matter we approximate the unit lattice as a spherical Wigner-Seitz cell,
wherein the meson mean fields and nucleon Dirac wave functions are solved fully
self-consistently. We also calculate uniform nuclear matter for a wide range of
temperatures, densities, and proton fractions, and match them to non-uniform
matter as the density decreases. The calculations took over 6,000 CPU days in
Indiana University's supercomputer clusters. We tabulate the resulting EoS at
over 107,000 grid points in the proton fraction range $Y_P$ = 0 to 0.56. For
the temperature range $T$ = 0.16 to 15.8 MeV we cover the density range $n_B$ =
10$^{-4}$ to 1.6 fm$^{-3}$; and for the higher temperature range $T$ = 15.8 to
80 MeV we cover the larger density range $n_B$ = 10$^{-8}$ to 1.6 fm$^{-3}$. In
the future we plan to study low density, low temperature (T$<$15.8 MeV),
nuclear matter using a Virial expansion, and we will match the low density and
high density results to generate a complete EoS table for use in astrophysical
simulations of supernova and neutron star mergers.

two-parameter dark energy equation of state that varies linearly with the scale
factor, and assuming a flat universe, the area of the error ellipse can be
reduced by a factor of ~10 relative to current constraints by future
space-based supernova data and CMB measurements from the Planck satellite. If
the dark energy equation of state is described by a more general basis of
principal components, the expected improvement in volume-based figures of merit

only a factor of 2-5 smaller than current uncertainties, the constraints on
dark energy models bounded by -1<w<1 improve for approximately 6 independent
dark energy parameters resulting in a reduction of the total allowed volume of
principal component parameter space by a factor of ~100. Typical quintessence
models can be adequately described by just 2-3 of these parameters even given
the precision of future data, leading to a more modest but still significant
improvement. In addition to advances in supernova and CMB data, percent-level

binary, where the energy source is nuclear energy rather than orbital energy.
This can occur during the slow merger of a massive primary with a secondary of
1-3 Msun when the primary has already completed helium core burning. We show
that, in the final merging phase, hydrogen-rich material from the secondary can
be injected into the helium-burning shell of the primary. This leads to a
nuclear runaway and the explosive ejection of both the hydrogen and the helium
layer, producing a close binary containing a CO star and a low-mass companion.
We argue that this presents a viable scenario to produce short-period
black-hole binaries and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). We estimate a
LGRB rate of about 1.e-6 per year at solar metallicity, which implies that this
may account for a significant fraction of all LGRBs, and that this rate should
be higher at lower metallicity.

dispersion relation of active galaxies, we measured the velocity dispersions of
a sample of local Seyfert 1 galaxies, for which we have recently determined MBH
using reverberation mapping. For most objects, velocity dispersions were
measured from high S/N ratio optical spectra centered on the Ca II triplet
region (~8500 A), obtained at the Keck, Palomar, and Lick Observatories. For
two objects, in which the Ca II triplet region was contaminated by nuclear
emission, the measurement was based on high-quality H-band spectra obtained
with the OSIRIS at the Keck-II Telescope. Combining our new measurements with
data from the literature, we assemble a sample of 24 active galaxies with
stellar velocity dispersions and reverberation-based MBH measurements in the
range of black hole mass 10^6<MBH/M_sun<10^9. We use this sample to obtain
reverberation mapping constraints on the slope and intrinsic scatter of the
M-sigma relation of active galaxies. Assuming a constant virial coefficient f
for the reverberation mapping black hole masses, we find a slope b=3.55+-0.60
and the intrinsic scatter sigma_int=0.43+-0.08 dex in the relation log
(MBH/M_sun) = a + b log (sigma/200 km/s), which are consistent with those found
for quiescent galaxies. We derive an updated value of the virial coefficient f
by finding the value which places the reverberation masses in best agreement
with the M-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies; using the quiescent M-sigma
relation determined by Gultekin et al. we find log f=0.72^{+0.09-0.10} with an
intrinsic scatter of 0.44+-0.07 dex. The uncertainty of the virial coefficient
remains one of the main sources of the uncertainty in black hole mass
determinations using reverberation mapping, and therefore also in single-epoch
spectroscopic estimates of MBH in active galaxies.

Mitola's work in 1992, Software Defined Radios (SDRs) have been
quite a hot topic in wireless systems research. Though many notable
achievements were reported in the field, the scarcity of computational power on
general purpose CPUs has always constrained their wide adoption in production
environments. If conveniently applied within an SDR context, classical concepts
known in computer science as space/time tradeoffs can be extremely helpful when
trying to mitigate this problem. Inspired by and building on those concepts,
this paper presents a novel SDR implementation technique which we call Memory
Acceleration (MA) that makes extensive use of the memory resources available on
a general purpose computing system, in order to accelerate signal computation.
MA can provide substantial acceleration factors when applied to conventional
SDRs without reducing their peculiar flexibility. As a practical proof of this,
an example of MA applied in the real world to the ETSI DVB-T Viterbi decoder is
provided. Actually MA is shown able to provide, when applied to such Viterbi
decoder, an acceleration factor of 10.4x, with no impact on error correction
performances of the decoder and by making no use of any other typical
performance enhancement techniques such as low level (Assembler) programming or
parallel computation, which though remain compatible with MA. Opportunity for
extending the MA approach to the entire radio system, thus implementing what we
call a Memory-Based Software Defined Radio (MB-SDR) is finally considered and
discussed.

fragmentation mass at a metallicity of ~10^-4 Z_sun when a strong molecule
destroying, LW background is present. However, If molecules can efficiently
form, they dominate the cooling at T < 10^4 K, demonstrating no 'critical

their inclusion would not significantly the results. We also find that this
physical scenario allows for the formation of a cluster of solar mass
fragments, or a single 10^4 M_sun fragment, possibly the precursors to primeval
clusters and SMBHs. Lastly, we conclude that the usual assumption of

important for today's applications. While previous work in this area has
concentrated on radio frequency (RF) channels, providing security guarantees

variations due small scale fading. Wireless optical communication, on the other
hand, is inherently more secure than RF communication due to the intrinsic
aspects of the signal propagation in the optical and near-optical frequency
range. In this paper, secure communication over wireless optical links is
examined by studying the secrecy capacity of a direct detection system. For the
degraded Poisson wiretap channel, a closed-form expression of the secrecy
capacity is given. A complete characterization of the general rate-equivocation
region is also presented. For achievability, an optimal code is explicitly
constructed by using the structured code designed by Wyner for the Poisson
channel. The converse is proved in two different ways: the first method relies
only on simple properties of the conditional expectation and basic information
theoretical inequalities, whereas the second method hinges on the recent link
established between minimum mean square estimation and mutual information in
Poisson channels.

The
primitive meteorite record suggests that sizeable planetesimals formed in the
asteroid belt over a period longer than a million years, each composed entirely
of an unusual, but homogeneous, mixture of mm-size particles. We sketch a
scenario in which primary accretion of 10-100km size planetesimals proceeds
directly, if sporadically, from aerodynamically-sorted mm-size particles
(generically ""chondrules""). These planetesimal sizes are in general agreement
with the currently observed asteroid mass peak near 100km diameter, which has
been identified as a ""fossil"" property of the pre-erosion, pre-depletion
population. We extend our primary accretion theory to make predictions for
outer solar system planetesimals, which may also have a preferred size in the
100km diameter range. We estimate formation rates of planetesimals and assess
the conditions needed to match estimates of both asteroid and Kuiper Belt
Object (KBO) formation rates. For nebula parameters that satisfy observed mass
accretion rates of Myr-old protoplanetary nebulae, the scenario is roughly
consistent with not only the ""fossil"" sizes of the asteroids, and their
estimated production rates, but also with the observed spread in formation ages
of chondrules in a given chondrite, and with a tolerably small radial diffusive
mixing during this time between formation and accretion (the model naturally
helps explain the peculiar size distribution of chondrules within such
objects). The scenario also produces 10-100km diameter primary KBOs. The
optimum range of parameters, however, represents a higher gas density and
fractional abundance of solids, and a smaller difference between keplerian and
pressure-supported orbital velocities, than ""canonical"" models of the solar
nebula. We discuss several potential explanations for these differences.

underneath the Moon's surface. These cascades have a negative charge excess and
radiate Cherenkov radio emission in a process known as the Askaryan effect. The
optimal frequency window for observation of these pulses with radio telescopes
on the Earth is around 150 MHz. By observing the Moon with the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope array we are able to set a new limit on the UHE
neutrino flux. The PuMa II backend is used to monitor the Moon in 4 frequency
bands between 113 and 175 MHz with a sampling frequency of 40 MHz. The
narrowband radio interference is digitally filtered out and the dispersive
effect of the Earth's ionosphere is compensated for. A trigger system is
implemented to search for short pulses. By inserting simulated pulses in the
raw data, the detection efficiency for pulses of various strength is
calculated. With 47.6 hours of observation time, we are able to set a limit on
the UHE neutrino flux. This new limit is an order of magnitude lower than
existing limits. In the near future, the digital radio array LOFAR will be used

(2009) and Koz{\l}owski et al. (2010) that this model can explain quasar light
curves at an impressive fidelity level (0.01-0.02 mag). The damped random walk
model provides a simple, fast [O(N) for N data points], and powerful
statistical description of quasar light curves by a characteristic time scale
(tau) and an asymptotic rms variability on long time scales (SF_inf). We
searched for correlations between these two variability parameters and physical
parameters such as luminosity and black hole mass, and rest-frame wavelength.
We find that tau increases with increasing wavelength with a power law index of
0.17, remains nearly constant with redshift and luminosity, and increases with
increasing black hole mass with power law index of 0.21+/-0.07. The amplitude
of variability is anti-correlated with the Eddington ratio, which suggests a
scenario where optical fluctuations are tied to variations in the accretion
rate. The radio-loudest quasars have systematically larger variability
amplitudes by about 30%, when corrected for the other observed trends, while
the distribution of their characteristic time scale is indistinguishable from
that of the full sample. We do not detect any statistically robust differences
in the characteristic time scale and variability amplitude between the full
sample and the small subsample of quasars detected by ROSAT. Our results
provide a simple quantitative framework for generating mock quasar light

density to the gravitational potential and its functions like the shear tensor.
For this purpose we examine whether or not one can make an accurate estimation
of the gravitational potential from an observational sample which is finite in
volume, biased due to galaxy biasing, and subject to redshift space distortion.
Dark halos in a $\Lambda$CDM simulation are used in this test. We find that one
needs to stay away from the sample boundaries by more than 30$h^{-1}$Mpc to
reduce the error within 20% of the root mean square values of the potential or
the shear tensor. The error due to the galaxy biasing can be significantly
reduced by using the galaxy mass density field instead of the galaxy number
density field. The error caused by the redshift space distortion can be
effectively removed by correcting galaxy positions for the peculiar velocity
effects. We inspect the dependence of dark matter halo properties on four
environmental parameters; local density, gravitational potential, and the
ellipticity and prolateness of the shear tensor. We find the local density has
the strongest correlation with halo properties. This is evidence that the
internal physical properties of dark halos are mainly controlled by small-scale
physics. In high density regions dark halos are on average more massive and
spherical, and have higher spin parameter and velocity dispersion. In high
density regions dark halos are on average more massive and spherical, and have
higher spin parameter and velocity dispersion. We also study the relation
between the environmental parameters and the subtypes of dark halos. The spin
parameter of satellite halos depends only weakly on the local density for all
mass ranges studied while that of isloated or central halos depends more
sensitively on the local density. (abridged)

the mass unbound in the interaction, $\delta M_{\rm ub}$, is related to the
initial binary separation, $a$, by a power law of the form $\delta M_{\rm ub}
\propto a^{m}$. This power-law index is found to vary from -3.1 to -4.0,
depending on the mass of the helium star. The small range of this index
brackets values found previously for hydrogen-rich companions, suggesting that
the dependence of the unbound mass on orbital separation is not strongly
sensitive to the nature of the binary companion. The kick velocity is also
related to the initial binary separation by a power law with an index in a
range from -2.7 to -3.3, but the power-law index differs from those found in

companion after the supernova is dominated by its orbital velocity in the

absorption-line width > 1600 \kms. The last criterion is a trade-off between
the completeness and consistency with respect to the canonical definition of
BAL quasars that have the `balnicity index' BI>0 in CIV BAL. We adopted such a
criterion to ensure that ~90% of our sample are classical BAL quasars and the
completeness is ~80%, based on extensive tests using high-z quasar samples with
measurements of both CIV and MgII BALs. We found (1) MgII BAL is more
frequently detected in quasars with narrower Hbeta emission-line, weaker [OIII]
emission-line, stronger optical FeII multiplets and higher luminosity. In term
of fundamental physical parameters of a black hole accretion system, loBAL
fraction is significantly higher in quasars with a higher Eddington ratio than
those with a lower Eddington ratio. The fraction is not dependent on the black
hole mass in the range concerned. The overall fraction distribution is broad,
suggesting a large range of covering factor of the absorption material. (2)
[OIII]-weak loBAL quasars averagely show undetected [NeV] emission line and a
very small line ratio of [NeV] to [OIII]. However, the line ratio in non-BAL
quasars, which is much larger than that in [OIII]-weak loBAL quasars, is
independent of the strength of the [OIII] line. (3) loBAL and non-loBAL quasars
have similar colors in near-infrared to optical band but different colors in
ultraviolet. (4) Quasars with MgII absorption lines of intermediate width are
indistinguishable from the non-loBAL quasars in optical emission line
properties but their colors are similar to loBAL quasars, redder than non-BAL
quasars. We also discuss the implication of these results.

early-type morphology and dark matter halo mass from a group catalog as a proxy
for environmental density: for galaxies of a given stellar mass the quiescent
fraction is found to increase with increasing dark matter halo mass. Our novel
result is that - at a given stellar mass - quiescent galaxies are significantly
flatter in dense environments, implying a higher fraction of disk galaxies.
Supposing that the denser environments differ simply by a higher incidence of
quiescent disk galaxies that are structurally similar to star-forming disk

simulations and the analytical theory employing the effective pure dephasing
Hamiltonian. The comparison shows that the latter approach describes very well
the spin echo decay at magnetic fields larger than the typical Overhauser

spin echo decay between the cases of a homonuclear and a heteronuclear bath

predicted previously using the effective Hamiltonian approach, is still visible
at very low fields outside the regime of applicability of the analytical

oscillates with a frequency corresponding to the Zeeman splitting of the single

extinction parameters, whereas Ha and [NII] have allowed us to estimate SFR,
metallicities, ionization mechanisms, and dynamical masses. In order to enforce
agreement between SFRs from Ha with those derived from rest-frame UV and MIR,
additional obscuration for the emission lines (that originate in HII regions)
was required compared to the extinction derived from the slope of the UV
continuum. We have also derived the stellar mass-metallicity relation, as well
as the relation between stellar mass and specific SFR, and compared them to the
results in other studies. At a given stellar mass, the sBzKs appear to have
been already enriched to metallicities close to those of local star-forming
galaxies of similar mass. The sBzKs presented here tend to have higher
metallicities compared to those of UV-selected galaxies, indicating that NIR
selected galaxies tend to be a chemically more evolved population. The sBzKs
show specific SFRs that are systematically higher, by up to ~2 orders of
magnitude, compared to those of local galaxies of the same mass. The empirical
correlations between stellar mass and metallicity, and stellar mass and
specific SFR are then compared with those of population synthesis models
constructed either with the simple closed-box assumption, or within an infall
scenario. Within the assumptions that are built-in such models, it appears that
a short timescale for the star-formation (~100 Myr) and large initial gas mass
appear to be required if one wants to reproduce both relations simultaneously.

expression of protein-coding genes in plants and animals. They are known to
play an important role in several biological processes and, together with
transcription factors, form a complex and highly interconnected regulatory
network. Looking at the structure of this network it is possible to recognize a
few overrepresented motifs which are expected to perform important elementary
regulatory functions. Among them a special role is played by the
microRNA-mediated feedforward loop in which a master transcription factor
regulates a microRNA and, together with it, a set of target genes. In this
paper we show analytically and through simulations that the incoherent version
of this motif can couple the fine-tuning of a target protein level with an
efficient noise control, thus conferring precision and stability to the overall
gene expression program, especially in the presence of fluctuations in upstream
regulators. Among the other results, a nontrivial prediction of our model is
that the optimal attenuation of fluctuations coincides with a modest repression
of the target expression. This feature is coherent with the expected
fine-tuning function and in agreement with experimental observations of the
actual impact of a wide class of microRNAs on the protein output of their
targets. Finally we describe the impact on noise-buffering efficiency of the
cross-talk between microRNA targets that can naturally arise if the
microRNA-mediated circuit is not considered as isolated, but embedded in a
larger network of regulations.

examine a determination proposed by the HPQCD collaboration that uses the decay

over an orthogonal two-hop wireless network with a broadcasting relay. The
network consists of multiple sources and destinations in which each

channel and the orthogonal multiple access relay channel. The focus is on
complexity constrained scenarios, e.g., for wireless sensor networks, where
channel coding is practically imperfect. Taking a source-channel and network
coding approach, we design the network code (mapping) at the relay such that
the average reconstruction distortion at the destinations is minimized. To this
end, by decomposing the distortion into its components, an efficient design
algorithm is proposed. The resulting network code is nonlinear and
substantially outperforms the best performing linear network code. A motivating
formulation of a family of structured nonlinear network codes is also
presented. Numerical results and comparison with linear network coding at the
relay and the corresponding distortion-power bound demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed schemes and a promising research direction.

synchrotron peaked (LSP/ISP) BL Lac objects. Autocorrelation time scales vary
from 4 to a dozen of weeks. Variable sources of the sample have 1/(f^{a}) PDS
and show two modes: (1) rather constant baseline with sporadic flaring activity
characterized by flatter PDS slopes resembling flickering and red-noise with
occasional intermittence, and (2) - measured for a few blazars showing strong
activity - complex and structured temporal profiles characterized by
longer-term memory and steeper PDS slopes typical of a random-walk underlying
mechanism. The average PDS slope of the brightest 22 FSRQs and the 6 brightest

resolved flares shows that they generally have symmetric profiles and that

transmission resonances when the incidence angle is less than the critical
angle for total reflection, while their magnitudes become only the order of
Fermi wavelength when the incidence angle is larger than the critical angle.
