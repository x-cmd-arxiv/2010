all the variables in the system are binary, where leaves represent the
observable variables and where all the inner nodes are unobserved. A novel
approach based on the theory of partially ordered sets allows us to obtain a
convenient parametrization of this model class. The construction of the
proposed coordinate system mirrors the combinatorial definition of cumulants. A
simple product-like form of the resulting parametrization gives insight into
identifiability issues associated with this model class. In particular, we
provide necessary and sufficient conditions for such a model to be identified
up to the switching of labels of the inner nodes. When these conditions hold,
we give explicit formulas for the parameters of the model. Whenever the model
fails to be identified, we use the new parametrization to describe the geometry
of the unidentified parameter space. We illustrate these results using a simple
example.

an index-group $\m g$ and a finite field $\m F_p$ for a prime modulus $p$
\cite{Bul_arch_1}. This paper deals mainly with ACA on infinite commutative
groups and direct products of them with some non commutative $p$-groups. It
appears that for all abelian groups, the rules and initial states with finite
supports define behaviors which being restricted to some infinite regular
series of time moments become significantly simplified. In particular, for free
abelian groups with $n$ generators states $V^{[t]}$ of ACA with a rule $R$ at
time moments $t=p^k,k>k_0,$ can be viewed as $||R||$ copies of initial state
$V^{[0]}$ moving through an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. That is the
behavior is similar to gliders from J.Conway's automaton {\sl Life}. For some
other special infinite series of time moments the automata states approximate
self-similar structures and the approximation becomes better with time. An
infinite class $\mathrm{DHC}(\mbf S,\theta)$ of non-commutative $p$-groups is
described which in particular includes quaternion and dihedral $p$-groups. It
is shown that the simplification of behaviors takes place as well for direct
products of non-commutative groups from the class $\mathrm{DHC}(\mbf S,\theta)$
with commutative groups. Finally, an automaton on a non-commutative group is
constructed such that its behavior at time moments $2^k,k\ge2,$ is similar to a
glider gun. It is concluded that ACA on non-commutative groups demonstrate more
diverse variety of behaviors comparing to ACA on commutative groups.

describe a quantum phase transition between an ordinary and a ferromagnetic

more scatter. The atomic gas--to--stars ratio shows a break near $W_{20} = 250$

all tiles of a particular type (e.g., an RNAse enzyme destroys all RNA tiles).
We show that a single use of this destruction operation enables much more
efficient construction of arbitrary shapes. In particular, an arbitrary shape
can be constructed using an asymptotically optimal number of distinct tile
types (related to the shape's Kolmogorov complexity), after scaling the shape
by only a logarithmic factor. By contrast, without the destruction operation,
the best such result has a scale factor at least linear in the size of the
shape, and is connected only by a spanning tree of the scaled tiles. We also
characterize a large collection of shapes that can be constructed efficiently
without any scaling.

  Models","13 pages and 1 figure",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An open problem that arises when using modern iterative linear solvers, such
as the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method or Generalized Minimum
RESidual method (GMRES) is how to choose the residual tolerance in the linear
solver to be consistent with the tolerance on the solution error. This problem
is especially acute for integrated groundwater models which are implicitly
coupled to another model, such as surface water models, and resolve both
multiple scales of flow and temporal interaction terms, giving rise to linear
systems with variable scaling.
  This article uses the theory of 'forward error bound estimation' to show how
rescaling the linear system affects the correspondence between the residual
error in the preconditioned linear system and the solution error. Using
examples of linear systems from models developed using the USGS GSFLOW package
and the California State Department of Water Resources' Integrated Water Flow
Model (IWFM), we observe that this error bound guides the choice of a practical
measure for controlling the error in rescaled linear systems. It is found that
forward error can be controlled in preconditioned GMRES by rescaling the linear
system and normalizing the stopping tolerance. We implemented a preconditioned
GMRES algorithm and benchmarked it against the Successive-Over-Relaxation (SOR)
method. Improved error control reduces redundant iterations in the GMRES
algorithm and results in overall simulation speedups as large as 7.7x. This
research is expected to broadly impact groundwater modelers through the
demonstration of a practical approach for setting the residual tolerance in
line with the solution error tolerance.

Gauss-Bonnet and in pure 3rd order Lovelock gravity. If matter is added in the
form of a massive vector field, we also show that Lifshitz solutions in

obtain a broad range of charged black hole solutions with Lifshitz asymptotics,

problems had been traditionally addressed within the context of sensor array
signal processing, the recent trend is to apply compressive sensing (CS) due to
its capability to estimate sparse support even with an insufficient number of
snapshots, in which case classical array signal processing fails. However, CS
guarantees the accurate recovery in a probabilistic manner, which often shows
inferior performance in the regime where the traditional array signal
processing approaches succeed. The apparent dichotomy between the {\em
probabilistic} CS and {\em deterministic} sensor array signal processing have
not been fully understood. The main contribution of the present article is a
unified approach that unveils a {missing link} between CS and array signal
processing. The new algorithm, which we call {\em compressive MUSIC},
identifies the parts of support using CS, after which the remaining supports
are estimated using a novel generalized MUSIC criterion. Using a large system
MMV model, we show that our compressive MUSIC requires a smaller number of
sensor elements for accurate support recovery than the existing CS methods and
can approach the optimal $l_0$-bound with finite number of snapshots.

imaging at high angular resolution is today a major goal for trying to match
optical wide-field performances. All the radio-interferometric, wide-field
imaging methods currently belong to the mosaicking family. Based on a 30 years
old, original idea from Ekers & Rots, we aim at proposing an alternate
formalism. Starting from their ideal case, we successively evaluate the impact
of the standard ingredients of interferometric imaging. A comparison with
standard nonlinear mosaicking shows that both processing schemes are not
mathematically equivalent, though they both recover the sky brightness. In
particular, the weighting scheme is very different in both methods. Moreover,
the proposed scheme naturally processes the short spacings from both
single-dish antennas and heterogeneous arrays. Finally, the sky gridding of the
measured visibilities, required by the proposed scheme, may potentially save
large amounts of hard-disk space and cpu processing power over mosaicking when
handling data sets acquired with the on-the-fly observing mode. We propose to
call this promising family of imaging methods wide-field synthesis because it
explicitly synthesizes visibilities at a much finer spatial frequency
resolution than the one set by the diameter of the interferometer antennas.

framework of the mean-field theory, there is the significant amplification of
the ferromagnetism induced by the ferromagnetic metal (Fe) in the system of
magnetic impurities (Mn) due to their indirect interaction via the conductivity
channel in the quantum well. As a result, the high-temperature ferromagnetism
arises leading to the spin polarization of charge carriers (holes) localized in
the quantum well and preserving their high mobility.

outlined a general architectural concept that solves many of the current

clear separation of astronomical code and IT infrastructure. By relying on
modern IT concepts for messaging and distributed execution, it provides full
scalability from desktops to clusters of computers. A generic parameter passing
mechanism and common interfaces will offer easy access to a wide range of
astronomical software, including legacy packages, through a single scripting

assuming that each packet is allowed at most $D$ retransmissions end-to-end,
and the reliability is defined as the probability that the packet is
successfully decoded in at most $D$ retransmissions. The throughput of the ad

be the maximum allowable density of transmitting nodes satisfying a per

with the rate of transmission and the success probability. Given an end-to-end
retransmission constraint of $D$, the optimal allocation of the number of

path integral techniques applied to a nonlinear model Hamiltonian. The base
pairs relative displacements are interpreted as time dependent paths whose
amplitudes are consistent with the model potential for the hydrogen bonds
between complementary strands. The portion of configuration space contributing
to the partition function is determined, at any temperature, by selecting the
ensemble of paths which fulfill the second law of thermodynamics. For a short
DNA fragment, the denaturation is signaled by a succession of peaks in the
specific heat plots while the entropy grows continuously versus $T$. Thus, the
opening of the double strand with bubble formation appears as a smooth
crossover due to base pair fluctuation effects which are accounted for by the
path integral method. The multistep transition is driven by the AT-rich regions
of the DNA fragment. The base pairs path ensemble shows an enhanced degree of
cooperativity at about the same temperatures for which the specific heat peaks
occur. These findings establish a link between microscopic and macroscopic
signatures of the transition. The fractions of mean base pair stretchings are
computed by varying the AT base pairs content and taking some threshold values
for the occurrence of the molecule denaturation.

be strong and in some cases dramatic, as in the high-frequency regime where the
conductance distribution shows a sharp cut-off. In this frequency regime, the
conductance is written as a product of a frequency-dependent term and a field
independent term, the latter containing the information on the disorder in the

is found that the conductance distribution and the correlations of the

Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar equation with an effective number of channels. In
the regime of strong localization, induced by the disorder or the ac field,

known to possess a massive degeneracy of the ground state, which, however,
might be lifted due to thermal fluctuations leading to a unique ordered state,
the effect known as 'order-by-disorder'. We find that the model exhibits an
intriguing ordering behavior, particularly near the AF phase boundary. The
energy scale of the order-by-disorder is suppressed there down to extremely low
temperatures, giving rise to exotic spin-liquid states like a ""ring-liquid"" or

Service (QoS) to the users working on different applications which have
diversified nature of QoS requirements. This paper proposes a fuzzy neural
approach for call admission control in a multi class traffic based Next
Generation Wireless Networks (NGWN). The proposed Fuzzy Neural Call Admission
Control (FNCAC) scheme is an integrated CAC module that combines the linguistic
control capabilities of the fuzzy logic controller and the learning
capabilities of the neural networks .The model is based on Recurrent Radial
Basis Function Networks (RRBFN) which have better learning and adaptability
that can be used to develop the intelligent system to handle the incoming
traffic in the heterogeneous network environment. The proposed FNCAC can
achieve reduced call blocking probability keeping the resource utilisation at
an optimal level. In the proposed algorithm we have considered three classes of
traffic having different QoS requirements. We have considered the heterogeneous
network environment which can effectively handle this traffic. The traffic
classes taken for the study are Conversational traffic, Interactive traffic and
back ground traffic which are with varied QoS parameters. The paper also
presents the analytical model for the CAC .The paper compares the call blocking
probabilities for all the three types of traffic in both the models. The
simulation results indicate that compared to Fuzzy logic based CAC,
Conventional CAC, The simulation results are optimistic and indicates that the
proposed FNCAC algorithm performs better where the call blocking probability is
minimal when compared to other two methods.

networks.they also hold their own challenges. More research has been done on
Electronic Multistage Interconnection Networks, (EMINs) but these days optical
communication is a good networking choice to meet the increasing demands of
high-performance computing communication applications for high bandwidth
applications. The electronic Multistage Interconnection Networks (EMINs) and
the Optical Multistage Interconnection Networks (OMINs) have many similarities,
but there are some fundamental differences between them such as the
optical-loss during switching and the crosstalk problem in the optical
switches. To reduce the negative effect of crosstalk, various approaches which
apply the concept of dilation in either the space or time domain have been
proposed. With the space domain approach, extra SEs are used to ensure that at
most one input and one output of every SE will be used at any given time. For
an Optical network without crosstalk, it is needed to divide the messages into
several groups, and then deliver the messages using one time slot (pass) for
each group, which is called the time division multiplexing. This Paper
discusses the permutation passability behavior of optical MINs. The bandwidth
of optical MINs with or without crosstalk has also been explained. The results
thus obtained shows that the performance of the networks improves by allowing
crosstalk to some extent.

  absorption",,,"10.1051/0004-6361/201014845",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is observational evidence of propagating kink waves driven by
photospheric motions. These disturbances, interpreted as kink
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves are attenuated as they propagate upwards in the
solar corona. In this paper we show that resonant absorption provides a simple
explanation to the spatial damping of these waves. Kink MHD waves are studied
using a cylindrical model of solar magnetic flux tubes which includes a
non-uniform layer at the tube boundary. Assuming that the frequency is real and
the longitudinal wavenumber complex, the damping length and damping per
wavelength produced by resonant absorption are analytically calculated. The
damping length of propagating kink waves due resonant absorption is a
monotonically decreasing function of frequency. For kink waves with low
frequencies the damping length is exactly inversely proportional to frequency
and we denote this as the TGV relation. When moving to high frequencies the TGV
relation continues to be an exceptionally good approximation of the actual
dependency of the damping length on frequency. This dependency means that
resonant absorption is selective as it favours low frequency waves and can
efficiently remove high frequency waves from a broad band spectrum of kink
waves. It is selective as the damping length is inversely proportional to
frequency so that the damping becomes more severe with increasing frequency.
This means that radial inhomogeneity can cause solar waveguides to be a natural
low-pass filter for broadband disturbances. Hence kink wave trains travelling
along, e.g., coronal loops, will have a greater proportion of the high
frequency components dissipated lower down in the atmosphere. This could have
important consequences with respect to the spatial distribution of wave heating
in the solar atmosphere.

components in parameter space using precomputed combinatorial results, thus
avoiding the computation of the Jacobian of the vector field at the critical

play a crucial role. A wind termination within the temperature range of (1.5-3)
10^9 K greatly enhances the efficiency of the nu p-process. This implies that
the early wind phase, when the innermost layer of the preceding supernova
ejecta is still 200-1000 km from the center, is most relevant to the
nup-process. The outflows with Y_{e, 3} = 0.52-0.60 result in the production of
the p-nuclei up to A=108 with interesting amounts. Furthermore, the p-nuclei up
to A=152 can be produced if Y_{e, 3} = 0.65 is achieved. For the nuclear data
inputs, we test the sensitivity to the rates relevant to the breakout from the
pp-chain region (A < 12), to the (n, p) rates on heavy nuclei, and to the
nuclear masses along the nup-process pathway. We find that a small variation of
the rates of triple-alpha and of the (n, p) reaction on 56Ni leads to a
substantial change in the p-nuclei production. We also find that 96Pd (N=50) on
the nup-process path plays a role as a second seed nucleus for the production
of heavier p-nuclei. The uncertainty in the nuclear mass of 82Zr can lead to a
factor of two reduction in the abundance of the p-isotope 84Sr.

single-antenna receivers concurrently utilize the available communication

assume the performance measures associated with each receiver are monotonic
with the received power gains. In general, the systems' joint operation is
desired to be Pareto optimal. However, designing Pareto optimal resource
allocation schemes is known to be difficult. In order to reduce the complexity
of achieving efficient operating points, we show that it is sufficient to
consider rank-1 transmit covariance matrices and propose a framework for
determining the efficient beamforming vectors. These beamforming vectors are
thereby also parameterized by T(K-1) real-valued parameters each between zero
and one. The framework is based on analyzing each transmitter's power
gain-region which is composed of all jointly achievable power gains at the
receivers. The efficient beamforming vectors are on a specific boundary section
of the power gain-region, and in certain scenarios it is shown that it is
necessary to perform additional power allocation on the beamforming vectors.

as prestellar cores, hot cores and hot corinos. It has proven to be an
efficient probe to study the physical and chemical conditions of these
environments. The study of the deuteration of different molecules helps us to
understand their formation. This is especially interesting for complex
molecules such as methanol and bigger molecules for which it may allow to
differentiate between gas-phase and solid-state formation pathways. Methanol
exhibits a high deuterium fractionation in hot corinos. Since CH3OH is thought
to be a precursor of methyl formate we expect that deuterated methyl formate is
produced in such environments. We have searched for the singly-deuterated
isotopologue of methyl formate, DCOOCH3, in IRAS 16293-2422, a hot corino
well-known for its high degree of methanol deuteration. We have used the
IRAM/JCMT unbiased spectral survey of IRAS 16293-2422 which allows us to search
for the DCOOCH3 rotational transitions within the survey spectral range (80-280
GHz, 328-366 GHz). The expected emission of deuterated methyl formate is
modelled at LTE and compared with the observations.} We have tentatively
detected DCOOCH3 in the protostar IRAS 16293-2422. We assign eight lines
detected in the IRAM survey to DCOOCH3. Three of these lines are affected by
blending problems and one line is affected by calibration uncertainties,
nevertheless the LTE emission model is compatible with the observations. A
simple LTE modelling of the two cores in IRAS 16293-2422, based on a previous
interferometric study of HCOOCH3, allows us to estimate the amount of DCOOCH3
in IRAS 16293-2422. Adopting an excitation temperature of 100 K and a source
size of 2\arcsec and 1\farcs5 for the A and B cores, respectively, we find that
N(A,DCOOCH3) = N(B,DCOOCH3) ~ 6.10^14 /cm2. The derived deuterium fractionation
is ~ 15%, consistent with values for other deuterated species in this source
and much greater than that expected from the deuterium cosmic abundance.
DCOOCH3, if its tentative detection is confirmed, should now be considered in
theoretical models that study complex molecule formation and their deuteration
mechanisms. Experimental work is also needed to investigate the different
chemical routes leading to the formation of deuterated methyl formate.

least noisy percentile. Using this statistic, the hypothesis that a -25.6 ms
offset relative to the timing adopted by the WMAP collaboration gives a focus
at least as sharp as the uncorrected timing is rejected at 4.6\sigma
significance. The Q and V band maps also reject the -25.6 ms offset hypothesis
at high statistical significance. The requirement that the correct choice of
timing offset must maximise image sharpness implies that the hypothesis of a
timing error in the WMAP collaboration's compilation of the WMAP calibrated,
filtered TOD is rejected at high statistical significance in each of the Q, V
and W wavebands. However, the hypothesis that a timing error was applied during
calibration of the raw TOD, leading to a dipole-induced difference signal, is
not excluded by this method.

spatial and attosecond temporal resolutions. Such resolution is indispensable

bright ultrafast coherent X-ray source is highly desirable, for example, for
the diffractive imaging of individual large molecules, viruses, or cells. Here
we demonstrate experimentally a new compact X-ray source involving high-order
harmonics produced by a relativistic-irradiance femtosecond laser in a gas
target. In our first implementation using a 9 Terawatt laser, coherent soft
X-rays are emitted with a comb-like spectrum reaching the 'water window' range.
The generation mechanism is robust being based on phenomena inherent in
relativistic laser plasmas: self-focusing, nonlinear wave generation
accompanied by electron density singularities, and collective radiation by a
compact electric charge. The formation of singularities (electron density
spikes) is described by the elegant mathematical catastrophe theory, which
explains sudden changes in various complex systems, from physics to social
sciences. The new X-ray source has advantageous scalings, as the maximum
harmonic order is proportional to the cube of the laser amplitude enhanced by
relativistic self-focusing in plasma. This allows straightforward extension of
the coherent X-ray generation to the keV and tens of keV spectral regions. The
implemented X-ray source is remarkably easily accessible: the requirements for
the laser can be met in a university-scale laboratory, the gas jet is a
replenishable debris-free target, and the harmonics emanate directly from the
gas jet without additional devices. Our results open the way to a compact
coherent ultrashort brilliant X-ray source with single shot and high-repetition
rate capabilities, suitable for numerous applications and diagnostics in many

In these sub-systems the eigenproblem is solved, and the regions are combined

The tensorial structure of the Hamiltonian of many-body systems make them even

of large many-body systems to the complexity of two spatial sub-systems having
half the geometric size. Considering the exponential size of the Hilbert space

where the aim is to recover a set of jointly sparse multichannel vectors from
incomplete measurements. This problem has received increasing interest as an
extension of the single channel sparse recovery problem which lies at the heart
of the emerging field of compressed sensing. However the sparse approximation
problem has origins which include links to the field of array signal processing
where we find the inspiration for a new family of MMV algorithms based on the
MUSIC algorithm. We highlight the role of the rank of the coefficient matrix X
in determining the difficulty of the recovery problem. We derive the necessary
and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the sparse MMV solution, which
indicates that the larger the rank of X the less sparse X needs to be to ensure
uniqueness. We also show that the larger the rank of X the less the
computational effort required to solve the MMV problem through a combinatorial
search. In the second part of the paper we consider practical suboptimal
algorithms for solving the sparse MMV problem. We examine the rank awareness of
popular algorithms such as SOMP and mixed norm minimization techniques and show
them to be rank blind in terms of worst case analysis. We then consider a
family of greedy algorithms that are rank aware. The simplest such algorithm is
a discrete version of MUSIC and is guaranteed to recover the sparse vectors in
the full rank MMV case under mild conditions. We extend this idea to develop a
rank aware pursuit algorithm that naturally reduces to Order Recursive Matching
Pursuit (ORMP) in the single measurement case and also provides guaranteed
recovery in the full rank multi-measurement case. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that the rank aware algorithms are significantly better than
existing algorithms in dealing with multiple measurements.

Langevin equations of motion of a set of interacting monomers in the continuum
regime. Monomers interact via a radial, rapidly decaying intermonomer
potential. The morphology of generated clusters is analyzed through their
fractal dimension $d_f$ and the cluster coordination number. The time evolution
of the cluster fractal dimension is linked to the dynamics of two populations,
small ($k \le 15$) and large ($k>15$) clusters. At early times monomer-cluster
agglomeration is the dominant agglomeration mechanism ($d_f = 2.25$), whereas
at late times cluster-cluster agglomeration dominates ($d_f = 1.56$). Clusters
are found to be compact (mean coordination number $\sim 5$), tubular, and
elongated. The local, compact structure of the aggregates is attributed to the
isotropy of the interaction potential, which allows rearrangement of bonded
monomers, whereas the large-scale tubular structure is attributed to its
relatively short attractive range. The cluster translational diffusion
coefficient is determined to be inversely proportional to the cluster mass and
the (per-unit-mass) friction coefficient of an isolated monomer, a consequence
of the neglect of monomer shielding in a cluster. Clusters generated by
unshielded Langevin equations are referred to as \textit{ideal clusters}
because the surface area accessible to the underlying fluid is found to be the
sum of the accessible surface areas of the isolated monomers. Similarly, ideal
clusters do not have, on average, a preferential orientation. The decrease of
the numbers of clusters with time and a few collision kernel elements are
evaluated and compared to analytical expressions.

calculus to the more general setting of Hamiltonian torus actions on compact
symplectic manifolds with isolated fixed points. (See also [Kn99] and [Kn08].)
The main goal of this paper is to build on this work by finding more effective
formulas. More explicitly, given a generic component of the moment map, they
define a canonical class $\alpha_p$ in the equivariant cohomology of the
manifold $M$ for each fixed point $p \in M$. When they exist, canonical classes
form a natural basis of the equivariant cohomology of $M$. In particular, when
$M$ is a flag variety, these classes are the equivariant Schubert classes. It
is a long standing problem in combinatorics to find positive integral formulas
for the equivariant structure constants associated to this basis. Since
computing the restriction of the canonical classes to the fixed points
determines these structure constants, it is important to find effective
formulas for these restrictions. In this paper, we introduce new techniques for
calculating the restrictions of a canonical class $\alpha_p$ to a fixed point
$q$. Our formulas are nearly always simpler, in the sense that they count the
contributions over fewer paths. Moreover, our formula is manifestly positive
and integral in certain important special cases.

with focus on two aspects at the core of most models: the role of convective
turbulence, and the role of the `tachocline' at the base of the convection
zone. The standard view which treats the solar cycle as a manifestation of the
interaction between convection and magnetic fields is shown to be misplaced.
The main ingredient of the solar cycle, apart from differential rotation, is
instead buoyant instability of the magnetic field itself. This view of the
physics of the solar cycle was already established in the 1950s, but has been
eclipsed mathematically by mean field turbulence formalisms which make poor
contact with observations and have serious theoretical problems. The history of
this development in the literature is discussed critically. The source of the
magnetic field of the solar cycle is currently assumed to be located in the
`tachocline': the shear zone at the base of the convection zone. While the
azimuthal field of the cycle is indeed most likely located at the base of the
convection zone, it cannot be powered by the radial shear of the tachocline as
assumed in these models, since the radiative interior does not support
significant shear stresses. Instead, it must be the powered by the latitudinal
gradient in rotation rate in the convection zone, as in early models of the
solar cycle. Possible future directions for research are briefly discussed.

photometry of galaxies to derive their star formation rates (SFR), stellar
masses, ages, etc. requires making a priori assumptions about their star
formation histories (SFH). A widely adopted parameterization of the SFH, the
so-called tau-models where SFR goes as e^{-t/tau) is shown to lead to
unrealistically low ages when applied to star forming galaxies at z ~ 2, a
problem shared by other SFHs when the age is left as a free parameter in the
fitting. This happens because the SED of such galaxies, at all wavelengths, is
dominated by their youngest stellar populations, which outshine the older ones.
Thus, the SED of such galaxies conveys little information on the beginning of
star formation. To cope with this problem, we explore a variety of SFHs, such
as constant SFR and inverted-tau models - with SFR as e^{+t/tau) - along with
various priors on age, including assuming that star formation started at high
redshift in all the galaxies. We find that inverted-tau models with such latter
assumption give SFRs and extinctions in excellent agreement with the values
derived using only the UV part of the SED. These models are also shown to
accurately recover the SFRs and masses of mock galaxies at z ~ 2 constructed
from semi-analytic models. All other explored SFH templates do not fulfil these
two test. In particular, direct-tau models with unconstrained age in the
fitting procedure overstimate SFRs and underestimate stellar mass, and would
exacerbate an apparent mismatch between the cosmic evolution of the volume
densities of SFR and stellar mass. We conclude that for high-redshift star
forming galaxies an exponentially increasing SFR with a high formation redshift
is preferable to other forms of the SFH so far adopted in the literature.

diagnosing integrability and nonintegrability from a dynamical system theory

shown with the least number of independent isolating integrals that a

Here we extend the realm of stars with known planetary companions to include
hot, fast-rotating stars. Planet-like transits have previously been reported in
the lightcurve obtained by the SuperWASP survey of the A5 star HD15082
(WASP-33; V=8.3, v sin i = 86 km/sec). Here we report further photometry and
time-series spectroscopy through three separate transits, which we use to
confirm the existence of a gas giant planet with an orbital period of 1.22d in
orbit around HD15082. From the photometry and the properties of the planet
signal travelling through the spectral line profiles during the transit we
directly derive the size of the planet, the inclination and obliquity of its
orbital plane, and its retrograde orbital motion relative to the spin of the
star. This kind of analysis opens the way to studying the formation of planets

the transiting planet is small, yielding an upper mass limit of 4.1 Jupiter
masses on the planet. We also find evidence of a third body of sub-stellar mass
in the system, which may explain the unusual orbit of the transiting planet. In
HD 15082, the stellar line profiles also show evidence of non-radial
pulsations, clearly distinct from the planetary transit signal. This raises the
intriguing possibility that tides raised by the close-in planet may excite or
amplify the pulsations in such stars.

obtained several interesting statistical results based on the catalog. Most
prominences appear below the latitude of 60 degrees and at the height of about
26 Mm above the solar surface. Most of them are quite stable during the period
they are tracked. Nevertheless, some prominences have an upward speed of more
than 100 km/s, and some others show significant downward and/or azimuthal
speeds. There are strong correlations among the brightness, area and height.
The expansion of a prominence is probably one major cause of its fading during
the rising or erupting process.

periods between 0.1 and 15 days. Intermediate resolution spectra were obtained
using the Giraffe spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. Membership was
confirmed on the basis of RVs for 210 targets. We see a marked increase in the
fraction of rapidly rotators as we move to cooler spectral types. About 20 per
cent of M0-M1 stars have v sin i >15km/s, increasing to 90 per cent of M4
stars. Activity indices derived from the first two lines of the CaT (8498A and
8542A) show differing dependencies on rotation period and mass for stars lying
above and below the fully convective boundary. Higher mass stars, of spectral
type K3-M2.5, show chromospheric activity which increases with decreasing
Rossby number (the ratio of period to convective turnover time), saturating for
Rossby numbers <0.1. For cooler stars, which are probably fully convective and
almost all of which have Rossby numbers <0.1, there is a clear decrease in
chromospheric activity as (V-I)_0 increases, amounting to a fall of about a
factor of 2-3 between spectral types M2.5 and M4. This decrease in activity
levels at low Rossby numbers is not seen in X-ray observations of the coronae
of cluster M-dwarfs or of active field M-dwarfs. There is no evidence for
supersaturation of chromospheric activity for stars of any spectral type at
Rossby numbers <0.01. We suggest that the fall in the limiting level of
chromospheric emission beyond spectral type M3 in NGC~2516 is, like the
simultaneous increase in rotation rates in field stars, associated with a
change in the global magnetic topology as stars approach the fully convective
boundary and not due to any decrease in dynamo-generated magnetic flux.

have complex global effects on the tree overlays, making analysis surprisingly
subtle. To our knowledge, few prior analytic results for performance estimation
of tree based protocols under churn are currently known. We study a simple
Bellman-Ford-like protocol which performs network size estimation over a
tree-shaped overlay. A continuous time Markov model is constructed which allows
key protocol characteristics to be estimated, including the expected number of
nodes at a given (perceived) distance to the root and, for each such node, the
expected (perceived) size of the subnetwork rooted at that node. We validate
the model by simulation, using a range of network sizes, node degrees, and
churn-to-protocol rates, with convincing results.

  Cocomparability Graphs","24 pages, 4 figures, 4 algorithms",,,,"cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a graph $G$, the longest path problem asks to compute a simple path of
$G$ with the largest number of vertices. This problem is the most natural
optimization version of the well known and well studied Hamiltonian path
problem, and thus it is NP-hard on general graphs. However, in contrast to the
Hamiltonian path problem, there are only few restricted graph families such as
trees and some small graph classes where polynomial algorithms for the longest
path problem have been found. Recently it has been shown that this problem can
be solved in polynomial time on interval graphs by applying dynamic programming
to a characterizing ordering of the vertices of the given graph
\cite{longest-int-algo}, thus answering an open question. In the present paper,
we provide the first polynomial algorithm for the longest path problem on a
much greater class, namely on cocomparability graphs. Our algorithm uses a
similar - but essentially simpler - dynamic programming approach, which is
applied to a Lexicographic Depth First Search (LDFS) characterizing ordering of
the vertices of a cocomparability graph. Therefore, our results provide
evidence that this general dynamic programming approach can be used in a more
general setting, leading to efficient algorithms for the longest path problem
on greater classes of graphs. LDFS has recently been introduced in
\cite{Corneil-LDFS08}. Since then, a similar phenomenon of extending an
existing interval graph algorithm to cocomparability graphs by using an LDFS
preprocessing step has also been observed for the minimum path cover problem
\cite{Corneil-MPC}. Therefore, more interestingly, our results also provide
evidence that cocomparability graphs present an interval graph structure when
they are considered using an LDFS ordering of their vertices, which may lead to
other new and more efficient combinatorial algorithms.

off-resonant cavity feeding, which manifests itself in a bare cavity emission
peak at the strong coupling point, is suppressed by as much as 40% under QRE
relative to ABE. We attribute this suppression to a reduced probability of QD
charging because electrons and holes are created in pairs inside the QD. We
investigate the pump power dependence of the cavity feeding and show that,
below saturation, the ratio of the bare cavity emission to polariton emission
for ABE is independent of pump power, while for QRE there is linear pump power
dependence. These results suggest that the biexciton plays an important role in
cavity feeding for QRE.
