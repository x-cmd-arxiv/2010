propagation through a three-dimensional disordered medium. The multiple
scattering process induces photon correlations that are directly measured for
light sources with different photon statistics. We find that multiple scattered
photons between different angular directions with angles much larger than the
average speckle width are strongly correlated. The time dependence of the
angular photon correlation function is investigated and the coherence time of
the light source is determined. Our results are found to be in excellent
agreement with the continuous mode quantum theory of multiple scattering of
light. The presented experimental technique is essential in order to study
quantum phenomena in multiple scattering random media such as quantum
interference and quantum entanglement of photons.

can catalyze via enzymes encoded in its genome. A genotype is viable in a given
environment if it is capable of producing all biomass components the organism
needs to survive and reproduce. Previous work has focused on the properties of
individual genotypes while little is known about how genome-scale metabolic
networks with a given function can vary in their reaction content. Results: We
here characterize spaces of such genotypes. Specifically, we study metabolic
genotypes whose phenotype is viability in minimal chemical environments that
differ in their sole carbon sources. We show that regardless of the number of
reactions in a metabolic genotype, the genotypes of a given phenotype typically
form vast, connected, and unstructured sets -- genotype networks -- that nearly
span the whole of genotype space. The robustness of metabolic phenotypes to
random reaction removal in such spaces has a narrow distribution with a high
mean. Different carbon sources differ in the number of metabolic genotypes in
their genotype network; this number decreases as a genotype is required to be
viable on increasing numbers of carbon sources, but much less than if metabolic
reactions were used independently across different chemical environments.
Conclusions: Our work shows that phenotype-preserving genotype networks have
generic organizational properties and that these properties are insensitive to
the number of reactions in metabolic genotypes.

used for measuring large unknown graphs, such as online social networks. It has
been empirically observed that an incomplete BFS is biased toward high degree
nodes. In contrast to more studied sampling techniques, such as random walks,
the precise bias of BFS has not been characterized to date. In this paper, we
quantify the degree bias of BFS sampling. In particular, we calculate the node
degree distribution expected to be observed by BFS as a function of the
fraction of covered nodes, in a random graph $RG(p_k)$ with a given degree
distribution $p_k$. Furthermore, we also show that, for $RG(p_k)$, all commonly
used graph traversal techniques (BFS, DFS, Forest Fire, and Snowball Sampling)
lead to the same bias, and we show how to correct for this bias. To give a
broader perspective, we compare this class of exploration techniques to random
walks that are well-studied and easier to analyze. Next, we study by simulation
the effect of graph properties not captured directly by our model. We find that
the bias gets amplified in graphs with strong positive assortativity. Finally,
we demonstrate the above results by sampling the Facebook social network, and
we provide some practical guidelines for graph sampling in practice.

depending on the initial rotational state acted upon by the field. An adiabatic
field-molecule interaction imparts a rotational energy shift which is negative
and exceeds the concomitant positive vibrational shift by a few orders of
magnitude. The rovibrational states are thus pushed downward in such a field. A
nonresonant pulsed laser field that interacts nonadiabatically with the

than any current experimental information on weak interaction processes in the
two-nucleon system. Moreover, it can impact our understanding of fundamental
reactions of astrophysical interest, like solar pp fusion and the $\nu+d$
reactions observed by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. Recent effective field
theory calculations have demonstrated, that all these reactions are related by
one axial two-body current term, parameterized by a single low-energy constant.
Muon capture on the deuteron is a clean and accurate way to determine this
constant. Once it is known, the above mentioned astrophysical, as well as other
important two-nucleon reactions, will be determined in a model independent way
at the same precision as the measured muon capture reaction.

criterion in the $Y-K$ vs. $g-z$ colour-colour diagram to separate stars and
quasars with redshift $z<4$, and two other criteria for selecting high-z
quasars. Using the SDSS-UKIDSS colour-z relations, we estimate the photometric
redshifts of 8498 SDSS-UKIDSS quasars, and find that 85.0% of them are
consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts within $|\Delta z|<0.2$, which
leads to a significant increase of the photometric redshift accuracy than that
based on the SDSS colour-z relations only. We compare our colour selection
criterion with a small UKIDSS/EDR quasar/star sample and a sample of 4671
variable sources in the SDSS Stripe 82 region with both SDSS and UKIDSS data,
and find that they can be clearly divided into two classes (quasars and stars)
by our criterion in the $Y-K$ vs. $g-z$ plot. We select 3834 quasar candidates
from the variable sources with $g<20.5$ in Stripe 82, 826 of them being SDSS
quasars and the rest without SDSS spectroscopy. We demonstrate that even at the
same spectroscopy limit as SDSS, with our criterion we can at least partially
recover the missing quasars with $z\sim2.7$ in SDSS. The SDSS identified
quasars only take a small fraction (21.5%) of our quasar candidates selected
from the variable sources in Stripe 82, indicating that a deeper spectroscopy
is very promising in producing a larger sample of quasars than SDSS. The

limited amount of pricing uncertainty. The price bounds of tranche option
derived from a default time copula are often very narrow, especially for the
senior part of the capital structure where there is the most market interests
for tranche options. The tranche option bounds from a default time copula can
often be computed semi-analytically without Monte Carlo simulation, therefore
it is feasible and practical to price and risk manage senior CDO tranche
options using the price bounds from a default time copula only.

temperature of the hot bubble formed by the post-shock gas in some PNs and
symbiotic nebulae is lower, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude, than
the value expected from simple hydrodynamical calculations. Although various
explanations have been proposed, there is as yet no prefered solution for this
low tempeature problem. PUIs have been invoked to explain the low temperature
behind the termination shock of the solar wind. While in the case of the solar
wind the neutral atoms that turn into PUIs penetrate the pre-shock solar wind
region from the interstellar medium (ISM), in PNs the PUI source is more likely
slowly moving clumps embedded in the fast wind or jets. These clumps are formed
by instabilities or from backflowing cold gas. Our estimates indicate that in
young PNs these PUIs will thermalize before leaving the system. Only in older
PNs whose sizes exceed ~5000 AU and for which the fast-wind mass loss rate is
below ~10^{-7} Mo/yr do we expect the PUIs to be an efficient carrier of energy

separately, next-to-leading order corrections (NLOPS). In this work we examine
the key criteria to be met in merging the two approaches in such a way that the

NLOPS. We then ask to what extent these requirements may be fulfilled using
existing simulations, without modifications. The result of this study is a
pragmatic proposal for merging MEPS and NLOPS events to yield much improved
MENLOPS event samples. We apply this method to W boson and top quark pair
production. In both cases results for distributions within the remit of the NLO

Coulomb problem in crystalline solids. The resulting method is systematically
improvable and well suited to large-scale quantum mechanical calculations in
which the Coulomb potential and energy of a continuous electronic density and
singular nuclear density are required. Linear scaling is achieved by
introducing smooth, strictly local neutralizing densities to render nuclear
interactions strictly local, and solving the remaining neutral Poisson problem
for the electrons in real space. While the formulation includes singular
nuclear potentials without smearing approximations, the required Poisson
solution is in Sobolev space $H^1$, as required for convergence in the energy
norm. We employ enriched finite elements, with enrichments from isolated atom
solutions, for an efficient solution of the resulting Poisson problem in the
interacting solid. We demonstrate the accuracy and convergence of the approach
by direct comparison to standard Ewald sums for a lattice of point charges, and
demonstrate the accuracy in all-electron quantum mechanical calculations with
an application to crystalline diamond.

the softening of the symmetry energy. Further, we have investigated

application widespread in the field of medical images in order to diagnose

accuracy of image segmentation using the segmentation algorithms is more when
compared with the manual segmentation. In the field of medical diagnosis an
extensive diversity of imaging techniques is presently available, such as
radiography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Medical image segmentation is an essential step for most consequent image
analysis tasks. Although the original FCM algorithm yields good results for
segmenting noise free images, it fails to segment images corrupted by noise,
outliers and other imaging artifact. This paper presents an image segmentation
approach using Modified Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm and Fuzzy Possibilistic
c-means algorithm (FPCM). This approach is a generalized version of standard
Fuzzy CMeans Clustering (FCM) algorithm. The limitation of the conventional FCM
technique is eliminated in modifying the standard technique. The Modified FCM
algorithm is formulated by modifying the distance measurement of the standard
FCM algorithm to permit the labeling of a pixel to be influenced by other
pixels and to restrain the noise effect during segmentation. Instead of having
one term in the objective function, a second term is included, forcing the
membership to be as high as possible without a maximum limit constraint of one.
Experiments are conducted on real images to investigate the performance of the
proposed modified FCM technique in segmenting the medical images. Standard FCM,
Modified FCM, Fuzzy Possibilistic CMeans algorithm (FPCM) are compared to
explore the accuracy of our proposed approach.

fuzzy logic and approximate reasoning. It is generated in five main parts: the
input interface, the fuzzification interface, knowledge base unit, decision
making unit and output defuzzification interface. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy
inference system (ANFIS) is a FIS model adapted by combining the fuzzy logic
and neural network. The ANFIS utilizes automatic identification of fuzzy logic
rules and adjustment of membership function (MF). Moreover, neural network can
directly learn from data set to construct fuzzy logic rules and MF implemented
in various applications. FIS settings are evaluated based on two comparisons.
The first evaluation is the comparison between unstructured and structured
events using the same FIS setting. The second comparison is the model settings
between FIS and ANFIS for classifying structured events. The data set consists
of news articles related to terrorism events in three southern provinces of
Thailand. The experimental results show that the classification performance of
the FIS resulting from structured events achieves satisfactory accuracy and is
better than the unstructured events. In addition, the classification of
structured events using ANFIS gives higher performance than the events using
only FIS in the prediction of terrorism events.

peptides, and the failure to satisfactorily calculate circular dichroism
spectra. Further, the proposed new geometrical structure for collagen is better
packed than both the 10/3 and the 7/2 structure. A feature of the suggested
collagen structure is the existence of a central channel with negatively
charged walls. We find support for this structural feature in some of the early
x-ray diffraction data of collagen. The central channel of the structure
suggests the possibility of a one-dimensional proton lattice. This geometry can
explain the observed magic angle effect seen in NMR studies of collagen. The

an asymptotically flat space-time with metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ is related to the
Hamiltonian $H_{GR}$ by $E=H_{GR}[g_{\mu\nu}]-H_{\rm GR}[\eta_{\mu\nu}]$, where
the subtraction of the flat-space contribution is necessary to get rid of an
otherwise divergent boundary term. This classic result indicates that the
energy associated to flat space does not gravitate. We apply the same principle
to study the effect of zero-point fluctuations of quantum fields in cosmology,
proposing that their contribution to the cosmic expansion is obtained computing
the vacuum energy of quantum fields in a FRW space-time with Hubble parameter
$H(t)$ and subtracting from it the flat-space contribution. [...] After
renormalization, this produces a renormalized vacuum energy density $\sim
M^2H^2(t)$, where $M$ is the scale where quantum gravity sets is, so for $M$ of
order of the Planck mass a vacuum energy density of the order of the critical
density can be obtained without any fine tuning. The counterterms can be chosen
so that the renormalized energy density and pressure satisfy $p=w\rho$, with
$w$ a parameter that can be fixed by comparison to the observed value, so in
particular one can chose $w=-1$. An energy density evolving in time as $H^2(t)$
is however observationally excluded as an explanation for the dominant dark
energy component which is responsible for the observed acceleration of the
universe. We rather propose that zero-point vacuum fluctuations provide a new
subdominant ""dark"" contribution to the cosmic expansion that, for a UV scale

new algorithm for SAR image segmentation. In this paper we propose segmentation
using vector quantization technique on entropy image. Initially, we obtain
entropy image and in second step we use Kekre's Fast Codebook Generation (KFCG)

128 was generated for the Entropy image. These code vectors were further
clustered in 8 clusters using same KFCG algorithm and converted into 8 images.
These 8 images were displayed as a result. This approach does not lead to over
segmentation or under segmentation. We compared these results with well known
Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix. The proposed algorithm gives better
segmentation with less complexity.

are incoherent and result in the pseudogap state. With the change of doping or
temperature, some pairs are formed in the nodal region which locates the Fermi
surface, and these pairs are coherent and lead to superconductivity. Thus the
coexistence of the pseudogap and the superconducting gap is explained when the
two kinds of gaps are not all on the Fermi surface. It is also shown that the

recursively splits the data samples into two sub clusters using the hyper plane

reallocating new cluster membership using the IB algorithm with different

points in the so called monomial case. The second step consists in the
elimination of these $n$-fold points (in the monomial case), which is achieved
by a simple combinatorial procedure for choices of centers.
  The invariants treated in this work allow us to define a notion of strong
monomial case which parallels that of monomial case in characteristic zero: If
a hypersurface is within the strong monomial case we prove that a resolution
can be achieved in a combinatorial manner.

planets -- designed to measure orbital eccentricities, spin-orbit alignments
and further planetary companions -- we have acquired radial velocity data for
the two transiting systems WASP-12 and WASP-14, each harbouring gas giants on
close orbits (orbital period of 1.09 and 2.24 days respectively). In both
cases, the initial orbital solution suggested a significant orbital
eccentricity, 0.049+-0.015 for WASP-12 and 0.091+-0.003 for WASP-14. Since
then, measurements of the secondary eclipse of WASP-12 in the infrared have
indicated that one projection of the eccentricity (e cos w) was very close to
zero, casting doubt on the eccentricity from the initial radial velocity orbit.
Our measurements confirm that the initial eccentricity detection could be
spurious, and show that the radial velocity data is compatible with a circular
orbit. A MCMC analysis taking into account the presence of correlated
systematic noise in both the radial velocity and photometric data gives e=0.017
(+0.015-0.011). By contrast, we confirm the orbital eccentricity of WASP-14,
and refine its value to e=0.088+-0.003. WASP-14 is thus the closest presently
known planet with a confirmed eccentric orbit.

n} along with minus signs associated to some vertices. Signed labeled forests
can be viewed as an extension of signed permutations. We define the inversion
number, the flag major index and the R-major index on signed labeled forests.
They can be considered as type B analogues of the indices for labeled forests
introduced by Bjorner and Wachs. The flag major index for signed labeled
forests is based on the flag major index on signed permutations introduced by
Adin and Roichman, whereas the R-major index for signed labeled forests is
based on the R-major index that we introduce for signed permutations, which is
closely related to the major defined by Reiner. We obtain q-hook length
formulas by q-counting signed labelings of a given forest with respect to the
above indices, from which we see that these three indices are equidistributed
for signed labeled forests. Our formulas for the major indices and the
inversion number are type B analogues of the formula due to Bjorner and Wachs.
We also give a type D analogue with respect to the inversion number of
even-signed labeled forests.
