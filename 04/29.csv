weighted versions of a known pulse shape. The minimal sampling rate for these
parametric signals is referred to as the rate of innovation and is equal to the
number of degrees of freedom per unit time. Although sampling of infinite pulse
streams was treated in previous works, either the rate of innovation was not
achieved, or the pulse shape was limited to Diracs. In this paper we propose a
multichannel architecture for sampling pulse streams with arbitrary shape,
operating at the rate of innovation. Our approach is based on modulating the
input signal with a set of properly chosen waveforms, followed by a bank of
integrators. This architecture is motivated by recent work on sub-Nyquist
sampling of multiband signals. We show that the pulse stream can be recovered
from the proposed minimal-rate samples using standard tools taken from spectral
estimation in a stable way even at high rates of innovation. In addition, we
address practical implementation issues, such as reduction of hardware
complexity and immunity to failure in the sampling channels. The resulting
scheme is flexible and exhibits better noise robustness than previous
approaches.

no-cloning theorem and the no-deleting theorem are the consequences of the
linearity and the unitarity. Together with the stronger no-cloning theorem they
provide permanence to quantum information, thus, suggesting that in the quantum
world information can neither be created nor be destroyed. In this sense
quantum information is robust, but at the same time it is also fragile because
any interaction with the environment may lead to loss of information. Recently,
another fundamental theorem was proved, namely, the no-hiding theorem that
addresses precisely the issue of information loss. It says that if any physical
process leads to bleaching of quantum information from the original system,
then it must reside in the rest of the universe with no information being
hidden in the correlation between these two subsystems. This has applications
in quantum teleportation, state randomization, private quantum channels,
thermalization and black hole evaporation. Here, we report experimental test of
the no-hiding theorem with the technique of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
We use the quantum state randomization of a qubit as one example of the
bleaching process and show that the missing information can be fully recovered
up to local unitary transformations in the ancilla qubits. Since NMR offers a
way to test fundamental predictions of quantum theory using coherent control of
quantum mechanical nuclear spin states, our experiment is a step forward in
this direction.

simulating 3-D nanophotonic devices, as these devices generate fields both in

of interest, such as optical couplers, have channels that can not be terminated
without generating reflections. Generating absorbers for these channels is a
new problem for SIE methods, as the methods were initially developed for
problems with finite surfaces. In this paper we show that the obvious approach
for eliminating reflections, making the channel mildly conductive outside the
domain of interest, is inaccurate. We describe a new method, in which the
absorber has a gradually increasing surface conductivity; such an absorber can
be easily incorporated in fast integral equation solvers. Numerical experiments
from a surface-conductivity modified FFT-accelerated PMCHW-based solver are
correlated with analytic results, demonstrating that this new method is orders
of magnitude more effective than a volume absorber, and that the smoothness of
the surface conductivity function determines the performance of the absorber.
In particular, we show that the magnitude of the transition reflection is
proportional to 1/L^(2d+2), where L is the absorber length and d is the order
of the differentiability of the surface conductivity function.

using the mapping on the slave fermion theory. The time-dependent diagrammatic
theory in terms of the Cu-O hopping t_pd starts from the locally gauge
invariant state with vanishing occupation of the Cu state and builds a finite
n_d in higher orders. This theory is locally gauge invariant asymptotically,
but replaces the d-p anticommutation between the Cu and O sites by the
commutation and is antisymmetrized a posteriori. Rather than t_pd, the small
parameter of the theory is n_d less or equal to 1/2. The leading many body
effect is band narrowing, different from the mean-field one. It is accompanied
by the d10-d9 intracell charge transfer disorder, which breaks the Luttinger
sum rule for the conduction band. The corresponding damping of the single
particle propagation is situated well below the Fermi level. The effective
local repulsions between the hybridized pdp propagators show up beyond the
third order. The a posteriori antisymmetrization removes the triplet repulsion
between the pdp particles but keeps the singlet repulsion which favors
incommensurate SDW correlations at low energy. Such repulsion is the metallic
counterpart of the superexchange J_pd between the dpd propagators. Resonant
valence bonds thus appear as perturbative corrections. The resulting theory is
shown to compare favorably with numerous experiments, emphasizing the physical
importance of the oxygen degrees of freedom.

to experimentally/computationally obtained data annotation associated with
terms from controlled vocabularies. This process usually involves obtaining
statistical significance for each vocabulary term and using the most
significant terms to describe a given set of biological entities, often
associated with weights. Many existing enrichment methods require selections of
(arbitrary number of) the most significant entities and/or do not account for
weights of entities. Others either mandate extensive simulations to obtain
statistics or assume normal weight distribution. In addition, most methods have
difficulty assigning correct statistical significance to terms with few
entities. Implementing the well-known Lugananni-Rice formula, we have developed
a novel approach, called SaddleSum, that is free from all the aforementioned
constraints and evaluated it against several existing methods. With entity
weights properly taken into account, SaddleSum is internally consistent and
stable with respect to the choice of number of most significant entities
selected. Making few assumptions on the input data, the proposed method is
universal and can thus be applied to areas beyond analysis of microarrays.
Employing asymptotic approximation, SaddleSum provides a term-size dependent
score distribution function that gives rise to accurate statistical
significance even for terms with few entities. As a consequence, SaddleSum
enables researchers to place confidence in its significance assignments to
small terms that are often biologically most specific.

processors that outperform their classical analogues and establishing
unconditionally secure communication protocols. Solids do usually present a
serious challenge to quantum coherence. However, owing to their spin-free
lattice and low spin orbit coupling, carbon materials and particularly diamond
are suitable for hosting robust solid state quantum registers. We show that
scalable quantum logic elements can be realized by exploring long range
magnetic dipolar coupling between individually addressable single electron
spins associated with separate color centers in diamond. Strong distance
dependence of coupling was used to characterize the separation of single qubits
98 A with unprecedented accuracy (3 A) close to a crystal lattice spacing. Our
demonstration of coherent control over both electron spins, conditional
dynamics, selective readout as well as switchable interaction, opens the way
towards a room temperature solid state scalable quantum register. Since both
electron spins are optically addressable, this solid state quantum device
operating at ambient conditions provides a degree of control that is currently
available only for atomic systems.

The main novelty of the approach is that it allows to treat generic intrachain
repulsive interactions of arbitrary strength. The chains are coupled by a
direct tunneling and four-fermion interactions. At low energies the individual
chains are described as Luttinger liquids with an arbitrary ratio of spin $v_s$
and charge $v_c$ velocities. A judicious choice of the basis for the decoupled
chains greatly simplifies the description and allows one to separate high and
low energy degrees of freedom. In a direct analogy to the bulk cuprates the
resulting effective field theory distinguishes between three qualitatively
different regimes: (i) small doping ($v_c << v_s$), (ii) optimal doping ($v_s
\approx v_c$) and (iii) large doping ($v_s << v_c$). I discuss the excitation
spectrum and derive expressions for the electron spectral function which turns
out to be highly incoherent. The degree of incoherence increases when one
considers an array of ladders (stripe phase).

respectively to a suppression or an enhancement of the radiation pressure. We
observe a maximum in the radiation pressure as a function of the induced phase
shift, marking the borderline of the validity of the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans

observations thus help to clarify the intricate relationship between Rayleigh

corrections is characterized by a single quantity, the Love number, which is
sensitive to the compactness parameter M/R and the star's internal structure,

particular interest due to its brightness at late times, as well as the
presence of optical flares at T0+10^5 s and later, which may indicate late-time
central engine activity. The LAT has detected a total of 16 GRBs; 9 of these

radio signal to propagate in the ionized intergalactic medium. This delay makes
it possible to use short gamma-ray burst alerts to promptly monitor specific
regions on the sky by low-frequency radio facilities, especially by LOFAR. To
estimate the strength of the radio signal, we assume a power-law dependence of
the radio luminosity on the total energy release in a magnetically dominated
outflow, as found in millisecond pulsars. Based on the planned LOFAR
sensitivity at 120 MHz, we estimate that the LOFAR detection rate of such radio
transients could be about several events per month from redshifts up to
$z\sim1.3$ in the most optimistic scenario. The LOFAR ability to detect such
events would crucially depend on exact efficiency of low-frequency radio

quasi-one-dimensional limit in which the system is regarded as a set of weakly

about an order of magnitude smaller than the weakest (diagonal) exchange in the

exquisitely sensitive to tiny interactions, heretofore neglected, of order a
few percent or less of the largest exchange couplings. These interactions,
which we describe in detail, induce entirely new phases, and a novel
commensurate-incommensurate transition, the signatures of which are identified
in NMR experiments. We discuss the differences between the behavior of
Cs_2CuCl_4 and an ideal two-dimensional triangular model, and in particular the

study correlations between the various molecular species, and discuss scenarios
of equilibrium and non-equilibrium chemistry in GJ 436b. We model the
atmosphere with a one-dimensional line-by-line radiative transfer code with
parameterized molecular abundances and temperature structure. We explore the
model parameter space with 10^6 models, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo
scheme. Our results encompass previous findings, indicating a paucity of
methane, an overabundance of CO and CO2, and a slight underabundance of H2O, as
compared to equilibrium chemistry with solar metallicity. The concentrations of
the species are highly correlated. Our best-fit, and most plausible,
constraints require a CH4 mixing ratio of 1.0E-7 to 1.0E-6, with CO >= 1.0E-3,
CO2 ~ 1.0E-6 to 1.0E-4, and H2O <= 1.0E-4; higher CH4 would require much higher
CO and CO2. Based on calculations of equilibrium and non-equilibrium chemistry,
we find that the observed abundances can potentially be explained by a
combination of high metallicity (~ 10 x solar) and vertical mixing with Kzz ~
10^6 - 10^7 cm^2/s. The inferred metallicity is enhanced over that of the host
star which is known to be consistent with solar metallicity. Our constraints
rule out a dayside thermal inversion in GJ 436b. We emphasize that the
constraints reported in this work depend crucially on the observations in the
two Spitzer channels at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. Future observations with
warm Spitzer and with the James Webb Space Telescope will be extremely
important to improve upon the present constraints on the abundances of carbon
species in the dayside atmosphere of GJ 436b.

measure, and (ii) the set $\SC$ can be extended to a larger clonable set

larger set. It is then shown that any local cloning apparatus is capable of
cloning a number of states that divides $D$ exactly. We provide a complete
solution for two central problems in local cloning, giving necessary and
sufficient conditions for (i) when a set of maximally entangled states can be
locally cloned, valid for all $D$; and (ii) local cloning of entangled qubit
states with non-vanishing entanglement. In both of these cases, a maximally
entangled resource is necessary and sufficient, and the states must be related
to each other by local unitary ""shift"" operations. These shifts are determined
by the group structure, so need not be simple cyclic permutations. Assuming
this shifted form and partially entangled states, then in D=3 we show that a
maximally entangled resource is again necessary and sufficient, while for
higher dimensional systems, we find that the resource state must be strictly

low ionization emission line regions (LINERs) and low luminosity AGN (LLAGN)
are a scaled-down version of their more luminous predecessors Seyfert galaxies.
Others, based on the lack of X-ray short (hours) time-scale variability, the
non-detection of an iron line at 6.4 keV, and the faint UV emission, suggest
the truncation of the classical thin accretion disk in the inner regions of the
AGN where a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) structure forms. We
investigate the LINER-Seyfert connection by studying the unabsorbed, AGN
powered, LINER galaxy NGC 4278. We analyzed one XMM-Newton and seven Chandra
X-ray observations of NGC 4278 spread over a three year period. We detected a
flux increase by a factor of ~3 on a ~3 months time-scale and by a factor of 5
between the faintest and the brightest observation separated by ~3 years.
During only the XMM-Newton observation, where the highest flux level is
detected, we found a 10% flux increase on a ~1 hour time-scale. A combination
of an absorbed power law (N(H)~10^20 cm^-2, Gamma~2.2) plus a thermal component
(kT~0.6 keV) were able to fit the Chandra spectra. The XMM-Newton spectra,
where the highest X-ray flux is detected, are well fitted with a single
absorbed power-law. No Fe K(alpha) emission line is detected at 6.4 keV. We
constructed SEDs based on simultaneous or quasi simultaneous observations and
compared them to LINER, radio-loud, and radio-quiet quasar SEDs. We find that
at a low X-ray flux the NGC 4278 SED resembles that of typical LINER sources
where the radio to X-ray emission can be considered as originating from a jet
and/or RIAF, whereas at a high X-ray flux, NGC 4278 SED is more like a low
luminosity Seyfert SED. Consequently, NGC 4278 could exhibit both LINER and
Seyfert nuclear activity depending on the strength of its X-ray emission.

dwarf S0 galaxy NGC 404, which hosts an extended gas disk. Our deepest field
reaches the red clump and main-sequence stars with ages <500 Myr. Although we
detect trace amounts of star formation at times more recent than 10 Gyr for all
fields, the proportion of red giant stars to asymptotic giants and main
sequence stars suggests that the disk is dominated by an ancient (>10 Gyr)
population. Detailed modeling of the color-magnitude diagram suggests that ~70%
of the stellar mass in the NGC 404 disk formed by z~2 (10 Gyr ago) and at least
~90% formed prior to z~1 (8 Gyr ago). These results indicate that the stellar
populations of the NGC 404 disk are on average significantly older than those
of other nearby disk galaxies, suggesting that early and late type disks may
have different long-term evolutionary histories, not simply differences in
their recent star formation rates. Comparisons of the spatial distribution of
the young stellar mass and FUV emission in GALEX images show that the brightest
FUV regions contain the youngest stars, but that some young stars (<160 Myr)
lie outside of these regions. FUV luminosity appears to be strongly affected by
both age and stellar mass within individual regions. Finally, we use our
measurements to infer the relationship between the star formation rate and the
gas density of the disk at previous epochs. We find that most of the history of
the NGC 404 disk is consistent with star formation that has decreased with the
gas density according to the Schmidt law. However, 0.5-1 Gyr ago, the star
formation rate was unusually low for the inferred gas density, consistent with
the possibility that there was a gas accretion event that reignited star
formation ~0.5 Gyr ago. Such an event could explain why this S0 galaxy hosts an
extended gas disk.

central star is rather controversial because the growth of massive solid core
necessary for triggering the CI can take longer than the lifetime of the
protoplanetary disk. In this work we assess the range of separations at which
the CI may operate by (1) allowing for arbitrary (physically meaningful) rate
of planetesimal accretion by the core and (2) properly taking into account the
dependence of the critical mass for the CI on the planetesimal accretion
luminosity. This self-consistent approach distinguishes our work from similar
studies in which only a specific planetesimal accretion regime was explored
and/or the critical core mass was fixed at some arbitrary level. We demonstrate
that the largest separation at which the CI can occur within 3 Myr corresponds
to the surface density of solids in the disk higher than 0.1 g cm^{-2} and is
40-50 AU in the minimum mass Solar nebula. This limiting separation is achieved
when the planetesimal accretion proceeds at the fastest possible rate, even
though the high associated accretion luminosity increases the critical core
mass delaying the onset of the CI. Our constraints are independent of the mass
of the central star and vary only weakly with the core density and its
atmospheric opacity. We also discuss various factors which can strengthen or
weaken our limits on the operation of the CI.

they are observed in 3 UV/optical (WFC3 UVIS) channel filters (F225W, F275W and
F336W), which allows us to identify three different sets of UV-dropout samples.
We apply Lyman break dropout selection criteria to identify F225W-, F275W- and
F336W-dropouts, which are z~1.7, 2.1 and 2.7 LBG candidates, respectively. Our
results are as follows: (1) these WFC3 UVIS filters are very reliable in
selecting LBGs with z~2.0, which helps to reduce the gap between the well
studied z~>3 and z~0 regimes, (2) the combined number counts agrees very well
with the observed change in the surface densities as a function of redshift
when compared with the higher redshift LBG samples; and (3) the best-fit
Schechter function parameters from the rest-frame UV luminosity functions at
three different redshifts fit very well with the evolutionary trend of the
characteristic absolute magnitude, and the faint-end slope, as a function of
redshift. This is the first study to illustrate the usefulness of the WFC3 UVIS
channel observations to select z<3 LBGs. The addition of the new WFC3 on the

significantly enhance our understanding of these galaxies using HST sensitivity

Paper IV [N. Gnan et al., J. Chem. Phys. v131, 234504 (2009)] showed that
strongly correlating liquids have ""isomorphs"", which are curves in the phase
diagram along which structure, dynamics, and some thermodynamic properties are
invariant in reduced units. In the present paper, using the fact that
reduced-unit radial distribution functions are isomorph invariant, we derive an
expression for the shapes of isomorphs in the WU phase diagram of generalized
Lennard-Jones systems of one or more types of particles. The isomorph shape
depends only on the Lennard-Jones exponents; thus all isomorphs of standard
Lennard-Jones systems (with exponents 12 and 6) can be scaled onto to a single
curve. Two applications are given. One is testing the prediction that the
solid-liquid coexistence curve follows an isomorph by comparing to recent
simulations by Ahmed and Sadus [J. Chem. Phys. v131, 174504 (2009)]. Excellent
agreement is found on the liquid side of the coexistence, whereas the agreement
is worse on the solid side. A second application is the derivation of an
approximate equation of state for generalized Lennard-Jones systems by
combining the isomorph theory with the Rosenfeld-Tarazona expression for the
temperature dependence of potential energy on isochores. It is shown that the
new equation of state agrees well with simulations.

measurements of many different CNT/QD pairs reveal behavior consistent with
resonant energy transfer between QD and CNT excitons via a Fohrster-like

length scales even though peak efficiencies are narrowly distributed around
96%. This saturation of efficiency is maintained even when energy transfer must
compete with elevated intrinsic non-radiative relaxation rates during QD aging.

on the negativity and realignment, we provide a set of entanglement-sharing
constraints for multipartite states, where the entanglement is not necessarily
limited to bipartite and pure states, thus aiding in the quantification of
constraints for entanglement-sharing. These may find applications in studying

v_0=(y,0), the vertical velocity of solutions to the linearized Euler equation

been proved. First, we show that in any (vorticity) H^{s}(s<(3/2)) neighborhood
of Couette flow, there exist non-parallel steady flows with arbitrary minimal
horizontal period. This implies that nonlinear inviscid damping is not true in
any (vorticity) H^{s}(s<(3/2)) neighborhood of Couette flow and for any
horizontal period. Indeed, the long time behavior in such neighborhoods are
very rich, including nontrivial steady flows, stable and unstable manifolds of
nearby unstable shears. Second, in the (vorticity) H^{s}(s>(3/2)) neighborhood
of Couette, we show that there exist no non-parallel steadily travelling flows

together with a description of the most elementary aspects of the two-component

concentrated upon the gauge characterization of the basic geometric objects
borne by the formalisms. It is pointed out that spin-affine configurations are
most naively defined by carrying out parallel displacements of null world
vectors within the framework of the {\gamma}-formalism. The standard result
that assigns a covariant gauge behaviour to the symmetric parts of any
admissible spin connexions is deduced out of building up a generalized version
of spin transformation laws. A fairly complete algebraic description of
curvature splittings is carried out on the basis of the construction of a set
of spinor commutators for each formalism. The pertinent computations take up
the utilization of some covariant differential prescriptions which facilitate
specifying the action of the commutators on arbitrary spin tensors and
densities. It turns out that the implementation of such commutators under
certain circumstances gives rise to a system of wave equations for gravitons
and Infeld-van der Waerden photons which possess in either formalism a
gauge-invariance property associated with appropriate spinor-index
configurations. The situation regarding the accomplishment of the couplings
between Dirac fields and electromagnetic curvatures is entertained to a
considerable extent.

analysis of the pulsating star RR Lyr, which is the primary target for our
study of the Blazhko effect. We used high-resolution and high signal-to-noise
ratio spectra to carry out a consistent parameter determination and abundance
analysis for RR Lyr. We provide a detailed description of the methodology
adopted to derive the fundamental parameters and the abundances. Stellar
pulsation attains high amplitudes in RR Lyrae stars, and as a consequence the
stellar parameters vary significantly over the pulsation cycle. The abundances
of the star, however, are not expected to change. From a set of available
high-resolution spectra of RR Lyr we selected the phase of maximum radius, at
which the spectra are least disturbed by the pulsation. Using the abundances
determined at this phase as a starting point, we expect to obtain a higher
accuracy in the fundamental parameters determined at other phases. The set of
fundamental parameters obtained in this work fits the observed spectrum
accurately. Through the abundance analysis, we find clear indications for a
depth-dependent microturbulent velocity, that we quantified. We confirm the
importance of a consistent analysis of relevant spectroscopic features,
application of advanced model atmospheres, and the use of up-to-date atomic
line data for the determination of stellar parameters. These results are
crucial for further studies, e.g., detailed theoretical modelling of the

alternating A and B layers with different dielectric constants. The mobile ions
are assumed to be insoluble in the B layers and hence confined to the A layers.
We find that the ions reduce the needed voltage most strongly when they are
constrained such that each A lamella is electrically neutral. In this case, a
macroscopic separation of charge and its concomitant lowering of free energy,
is attained only in the perpendicular orientation. When the ions are free to
move between different A layers, such that charge neutrality is only required
globally, their effect is smaller and depends upon the preferred surface
interaction of the two materials. Under some conditions, the addition of ions
can actually stabilize the parallel configuration. Our predictions are relevant

the high resolution (~0.2"") and seeing-free data sets of Hinode/SOT, we
selected the observations whose duration is longer than 70 minutes and cadence

double power law shape bent over at a frequency of 4.7 mHz. The power law index
in the high frequency range is -2.4 while the power law index in the low

1.1 km/s when we use a tracer size of 0.4"" in LCT method. Autocorrelation
functions of intensity fluctuation, horizontal velocity, and its spatial

ultrahigh dimensional linear regressions where the dimensionality is much

ultrahigh dimensional regression is the high spurious correlation between the

a two-stage refitted procedure via a data splitting technique, called refitted
cross-validation (RCV), to attenuate the influence of irrelevant variables with
high spurious correlations. Our asymptotic results show that the resulting
procedure performs as well as the oracle estimator, which knows in advance the
mean regression function. The simulation studies lend further support to our
theoretical claims. The naive two-stage estimator which fits the selected

encoder for a quantum convolutional code has a representation as a
convolutional encoder or as a ""pearl-necklace"" encoder. In the pearl-necklace
representation, it has not been particularly clear in the research literature
how much quantum memory such an encoder would require for implementation. Here,
we offer an algorithm that answers this question. The algorithm first
constructs a weighted, directed acyclic graph where each vertex of the graph
corresponds to a gate string in the pearl-necklace encoder, and each path
through the graph represents a path through non-commuting gates in the encoder.
We show that the weight of the longest path through the graph is equal to the
minimal amount of memory needed to implement the encoder. A dynamic programming
search through this graph determines the longest path. The running time for the
construction of the graph and search through it is quadratic in the number of
gate strings in the pearl-necklace encoder.

statistical analysis of mass functions of galaxies under a homogeneous dark

flux-limited X-ray cluster survey, and CMB data from WMAP. We compare, in our
analysis, the standard Press-Schechter (PS) approach (where a Gaussian
distribution is used to describe the primordial density fluctuation field of
the mass function), and the PL (Power Law) mass function (where we apply a
nonextensive q-statistical distribution to the primordial density field). We
conclude that the PS mass function cannot explain at the same time the X-ray

energy equation of state parameter is $\omega=-0.58$, which is distant from the
cosmological constant case. The PL mass function provides better fits to the

multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming over time-varying channels is presented in
terms of the entropy of the feedback messages. In the case that each transmit
antenna has its own power amplifier which has individual power limit, it has
been known that only phase steering information is necessary to form the
optimal transmit beamforming vector. Since temporal correlation exists for
wireless fading channels, one can utilize the previous reported feedback
messages as prior information to efficiently encode the current feedback
message. Thus, phase tracking information, difference between two phase
steering information in adjacent feedback slots, is sufficient as a feedback
message. We show that while the entropy of the phase steering information is a
constant, the entropy of the phase tracking information is a function of the
temporal correlation parameter. For the phase tracking information, upperbounds
on the entropy are presented in the Gaussian entropy and the von-Mises entropy
by using the theory on the maximum entropy distributions. Derived results can
quantify the amount of reduction in feedback overhead of the phase tracking
information over the phase steering information. For application perspective,
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of phase tracking beamforming over phase
steering beamforming is evaluated by using Monte-Carlo simulation. Also we show
that the derived entropies can determine the appropriate duration of the
feedback reports with respect to the degree of the channel variation rates.

though the ferroelectric is only one unit cell thick. The distortions yield
non-switchable polarizations, with magnitudes comparable to those of the
corresponding bulk ferroelectrics. In contrast, in superlattices with no polar
discontinuity at the interfaces, the off-centric movements in the ferroelectric
layer are usually suppressed. The details of the behavior and functional
properties are, however, found to be sensitive to epitaxial strain, rotational
instabilities and second-order Jahn-Teller activity, and are therefore strongly
in uenced by the chemical composition of the paraelectric layer.

expressed as the opposite of the derivative of the Fenchel conjuguate
$\tU(t,y)$. Under regularity assumptions, we associate a $SDE(\mu, \sigma)$ and
its adjoint SPDE$(\mu, \sigma)$ in divergence form whose $U_x(t,x)$ and its
inverse $-\tU_y(t,y)$ are monotonic solutions. More generally, special
attention is paid to rigorous justification of the dynamics of inverse flow of
SDE. So that, we are able to extend to the solution of similar SPDEs the
decomposition based on the solutions of two SDEs and their inverses. The second
part is concerned with forward utilities, consistent with a given incomplete
financial market, that can be observed but given exogenously to the investor.
As in \cite{zar-03}, market dynamics are considered in an equilibrium state, so
that the investor becomes indifferent to any action she can take in such a
market. After having made explicit the constraints induced on the local
characteristics of consistent utility and its conjugate, we focus on the
marginal utility SPDE by showing that it belongs to the previous family of
SPDEs. The associated two SDE's are related to the optimal wealth and the
optimal state price density, given a pathwise explicit representation of the
marginal utility. This new approach addresses several issues with a new
perspective: dynamic programming principle, risk tolerance properties, inverse
problems. Some examples and applications are given in the last section.

is as follows: two samples should be put into the same cluster if and only if
they were generated by the same distribution. With this notion of consistency,
clustering generalizes such classical statistical problems as homogeneity
testing and process classification. We show that, for the case of a known
number of clusters, consistency can be achieved under the only assumption that
the joint distribution of the data is stationary ergodic (no parametric or
Markovian assumptions, no assumptions of independence, neither between nor
within the samples). If the number of clusters is unknown, consistency can be
achieved under appropriate assumptions on the mixing rates of the processes.
(again, no parametric or independence assumptions). In both cases we give
examples of simple (at most quadratic in each argument) algorithms which are

that contains all M d orbitals and all non-metal p orbitals. We calculate all
interaction terms between d electrons originating from Coulomb repulsion, as a
function of three parameters (F_0, F_2 and F_4) and write them in a basis of
orbitals appropriate for cubic, tetragonal, tetrahedral or hexagonal symmetry
around M. The approach is based on solving exactly (numerically if necessary) a
MO_n cluster containing the transition-metal atom and its n nearest O atoms
(for example a CoO_6 cluster in the case of the cobaltates, or a CuO_n cluster
in the case of the cuprates, in which n depends on the number of apical O
atoms), and mapping them into many-body states of the same symmetry containing
d holes only. We illustrate the procedure for the case of Na_xCoO_2. The
resulting H_eff, including a trigonal distortion D, has been studied recently
and its electronic structure agrees well with angle-resolved photoemission
spectra [A. Bourgeois, A. A. Aligia, and M. J. Rozenberg, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102,
066402 (2009)]. Although H_eff contains only 3d t_2g holes, the highly
correlated states that they represent contain an important amount not only of O
2p holes but also of 3d e_g holes. When more holes are added, a significant
redistribution of charge takes place. As a consequence of these facts, the
resulting values of the effective interactions between t_2g states are smaller
than previously assumed, rendering more important the effect of D in obtaining
only one sheet around the center of the Brillouin zone for the Fermi surface

Our method, in spite of its conceptual simplicity (it has only two parameters)
is capable of generating a wide variety of network types with prescribed
statistical properties, e.g., with degree- or clustering coefficient
distributions of various, very different forms. In turn, these graphs can be
used to test hypotheses, or, as models of actual data. The method is based on a
mapping between suitably chosen singular measures defined on the unit square
and sparse infinite networks. Such a mapping has the great potential of
allowing for graph theoretical results for a variety of network topologies. The
main idea of our approach is to go to the infinite limit of the singular
measure and the size of the corresponding graph simultaneously. A very unique
feature of this construction is that the complexity of the generated network is
increasing with the size. We present analytic expressions derived from the
parameters of the -- to be iterated-- initial generating measure for such major
characteristics of graphs as their degree, clustering coefficient and
assortativity coefficient distributions. The optimal parameters of the
generating measure are determined from a simple simulated annealing process.

galaxies for which baryonic contributions to overall potentials are either
subtracted or negligible. Recent work indicates that rotation curves due to

similar, with a mean rotation curve given by
$\log_{10}[V_{c,\mathrm{DM}}/(\mathrm{km
s^{-1}})]=1.47_{-0.19}^{+0.15}+0.5\log_{10}[r/\mathrm{kpc}]$. Independent
studies show that while estimates of the dark mass of a given dwarf spheroidal
(dSph) galaxy are robust only near the half-light radius, data from the Milky
Way's (MW's) dSph satellites are consistent with a narrow range of mass
profiles. Here we combine published constraints on the dark halo masses of
spirals and dSphs and include available measurements of low surface brightness
galaxies for additional comparison. We find that most measured MW dSphs lie on
the extrapolation of the mean rotation curve due to DM in spirals. The union of
MW-dSph and spiral data appears to follow a mass-radius relation of the form
$M_{\mathrm{DM}}(r)/M_{\odot}=200_{-120}^{+200}(r/\mathrm{pc})^2$, or
equivalently a constant acceleration $g_{\mathrm{DM}}=3_{-2}^{+3}\times
10^{-9}\mathrm{cm s^{-2}}$, spanning $0.02\la r \la 75$ kpc. Evaluation at
specific radii immediately generates two results from the recent literature: a
common mass for MW dSphs at fixed radius and a constant DM central surface
density for galaxies ranging from MW dSphs to spirals. However, recent
kinematic measurements indicate that M31's dSph satellites are systematically
less massive than MW dSphs of similar size. Such deviations from what is
otherwise a surprisingly uniform halo relation presumably hold clues to
individual formation and evolutionary histories.

invariant objects for Hamiltonian dynamics. More precisely, we consider KAM
tori (i.e diffeomorphic copies of the torus such that the motion on them is
conjugated to a rigid rotation) both Lagrangian tori (of maximal dimension) and
whiskered tori (i.e. tori with hyperbolic directions which, together with the
tangents to the torus and the symplectic conjugates span the whole tangent
space). In the case of whiskered tori, we also present algorithms to compute
the invariant splitting and the invariant manifolds associated to the
splitting. We present them both for the case of discrete time and for
differential equations. The algorithms are based on a Newton method to solve an
appropriately chosen functional equation that expresses invariance. The
algorithms are efficient: if we discretize the objects by $N$ elements, one
step of the Newton method requires only O(N) storage and $O(N \ln(N))$
operations. Furthermore, if the object we consider is of dimension $\ell$, we
only need to compute functions of $\ell$ variables, independently of what is
the dimension of the phase space. The algorithms do not require that the system
is presented in action-angle variables nor that it is close to integrable. The
algorithms are backed up by rigorous \emph{a-posteriori} bounds which state
that if the equations are solved with a small residual and some explicitly
computable condition numbers are not too big, then, there is a true solution
which is close to the computed one. The algorithms apply both to primary (i.e
non-contractible) and secondary tori (i.e. contractible to a torus of lower
dimension, such as islands). They have already been implemented. We will report

strong correlation between the two samples and calculate that there are about
60 sources with a Rosat counterpart. Using the Rosat error boxes we provide
tentative associations for half of them, demonstrate that the majority of these

the BL Lac class. Given that they are X-ray selected and most are high
synchrotron peaked objects, which indicates the presence of high energy
electrons, these sources are also good candidates for TeV emission, and
therefore good probes of the extragalactic background light.

evolutionary cycle of stars and interstellar matter. The optical properties of
cosmic grains determine the interaction of the radiation field with the solids,
thereby regulating the temperature structure and spectral appearance of dusty
regions. Radiation pressure on dust grains and their collisions with the gas
atoms and molecules can drive powerful winds. The analysis of observed spectral
features, especially in the infrared wavelength range, provides important
information on grain size, composition and structure as well as temperature and
spatial distribution of the material.
  The relevant optical data for interstellar, circumstellar, and protoplanetary
grains can be obtained by measurements on cosmic dust analogs in the laboratory
or can be calculated from grain models based on optical constants. Both
approaches have made progress in the last years, triggered by the need to
interpret increasingly detailed high-quality astronomical observations. The
statistical theoretical approach, spectroscopic experiments at variable
temperature and absorption spectroscopy of aerosol particulates play an
important role for the successful application of the data in dust astrophysics.

observable effect of microlensing. We present the results of our search for
such events, based on the data from the second phase of the OGLE survey
(1996-2000) towards the SMC. The data set we used is comprised of 2.1 million
monitored sources distributed over an area of 2.4 square degrees. We found only
one microlensing event candidate, however its poor quality light curve limited
our discussion on the exact distance to the lensing object.
  Given a single event, taking the blending (crowding of stars) into account
for the detection efficiency simulations, and deriving the HST-corrected number
of monitored stars, the microlensing optical depth is tau=(1.55+-1.55)10e-7.
This result is consistent with the expected SMC self-lensing signal, with no
need of introducing dark matter microlenses. Rejecting the unconvincing event
leads to the upper limit on the fraction of dark matter in the form of MACHOs

way. We show explicitly how any element of $\mathcal{U}(d)$ can be composed of
matrix exponential functions of generalized anti-symmetric $\sigma$-matrices

identify and discard redundant parameters in several cases. In this way,
redundancy-free density matrices of arbitrary rank $k$ can be formulated. Our
construction can also be used to derive an orthonormal basis of any
$k$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^d$ with the minimal number of

weakness of the intrinsic magnetic field of planet Mercury. One of the possible
dynamo scenarios is a dynamo with feedback from the magnetosphere. Due to its
weak magnetic field Mercury exhibits a small magnetosphere whose subsolar
magnetopause distance is only about 1.7 Hermean radii. We consider the magnetic
field due to magnetopause currents in the dynamo region. Since the external
field of magnetospheric origin is antiparallel to the dipole component of the
dynamo field, a negative feedback results. For an alpha-omega-dynamo two
stationary solutions of such a feedback dynamo emerge, one with a weak and the
other with a strong magnetic field. The question, however, is how these
solutions can be realized. To address this problem, we discuss various
scenarios for a simple dynamo model and the conditions under which a steady
weak magnetic field can be reached. We find that the feedback mechanism
quenches the overall field to a low value of about 100 to 150 nT if the dynamo
is not driven too strongly.

for studying infinite mathematical structures, namely those deriving from
coinduction are essential. Here we use coinduction, or backward coinduction (to
show its connection with the same concept for finite games) to study carefully
and formally the infinite games especially those called dollar auctions, which
are considered as the paradigm of escalation. Unlike what is commonly admitted,
we show that, provided one assumes that the other agent will always stop,
bidding is rational, because it results in a subgame perfect equilibrium. We
show that this is not the only rational strategy profile (the only subgame
perfect equilibrium). Indeed if an agent stops and will stop at every step, we
claim that he is rational as well, if one admits that his opponent will never
stop, because this corresponds to a subgame perfect equilibrium. Amazingly, in
the infinite dollar auction game, the behavior in which both agents stop at
each step is not a Nash equilibrium, hence is not a subgame perfect
equilibrium, hence is not rational.

Bayesian hierarchy for sparse models using slab and spike priors (two-component
delta-function and continuous mixtures), non-Gaussian latent factors and a
stochastic search over the ordering of the variables. The framework, which we
call SLIM (Sparse Linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling), is validated and
bench-marked on artificial and real biological data sets. SLIM is closest in
spirit to LiNGAM (Shimizu et al., 2006), but differs substantially in
inference, Bayesian network structure learning and model comparison.
Experimentally, SLIM performs equally well or better than LiNGAM with
comparable computational complexity. We attribute this mainly to the stochastic
search strategy used, and to parsimony (sparsity and identifiability), which is
an explicit part of the model. We propose two extensions to the basic i.i.d.
linear framework: non-linear dependence on observed variables, called SNIM
(Sparse Non-linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling) and allowing for
correlations between latent variables, called CSLIM (Correlated SLIM), for the
temporal and/or spatial data. The source code and scripts are available from

a prominent soft thermal emission component in the spectrum. We analyze the

gamma-ray emission and the early X-ray plateau emission as synchrotron emission
from a dissipating Poynting-flux-dominated outflow, probably powered by a
magnetar with a spin period of $P \sim 10$ ms and the polar cap magnetic field
$B_{\rm p} \sim 3\times 10^{15}$ G. The energetic supernova SN 2010bh
associated with this burst is, however, difficult to interpret within the slow
magnetar model, which implies that the nascent magnetar may spin much faster
with an initial rotation period $\sim 1$ ms, and thus suggests a delay between
the core collapse and the emergence of the relativistic magnetar wind from the
star. The diverse behaviors of low-luminosity GRBs and their associated SNe may
be understood within a unified picture that invokes different initial powers of
the central engine and different delay times between the core collapse and the
emergence of the relativistic jet from the star.

that site restriction only has a minor influence on the system's dynamical

first order quantum phase transition. Furthermore, in the vicinity of the
endpoint, the order parameter has a non-perturbative BCS form. We also study a
competing crystallization transition in this model, and derive the full phase
diagram. This physics can be demonstrated experimentally in dipolar ultra-cold
atomic or molecular gases. In the presence of a harmonic trap, it manifests
itself as a sharp jump in the density profile.

subjected to biaxial compression are analyzed as a function of particle
elongation. We find that the shear strength is an increasing linear function of
elongation. Performing an additive decomposition of the stress tensor based on
a harmonic approximation of the angular dependence of branch vectors, contact
normals and forces, we show that the increasing mobilization of friction force
and the associated anisotropy are key effects of particle elongation. These
effects are correlated with partial nematic ordering of the particles which
tend to be oriented perpendicular to the major principal stress direction and
form side-to-side contacts. However, the force transmission is found to be
mainly guided by cap-to-side contacts, which represent the largest fraction of
contacts for the most elongated particles. Another interesting finding is that,
in contrast to shear strength, the solid fraction first increases with particle
elongation, but declines as the particles become more elongated. It is also
remarkable that the coordination number does not follow this trend so that the
packings of more elongated particles are looser but more strongly connected.

the clustering really captures spatial genomic dependency by showing that

study periodic elements in Garside groups and their conjugacy classes.
  We show that the periodicity of an element does not depend on the choice of a

  By a classical theorem of Brouwer, Ker\'ekj\'art\'o and Eilenberg, an
$n$-braid is periodic if and only if it is conjugate to a power of one of two
specific roots of $\Delta^2$. We generalize this to Garside groups by showing
that every periodic element is conjugate to a power of a root of $\Delta^m$.
  We introduce the notions of slimness and precentrality for periodic elements,
and show that the super summit set of a slim, precentral periodic element is
closed under any partial cycling. For the conjugacy problem, we may assume the
slimness without loss of generality. For the Artin groups of type $A_n$, $B_n$,
$D_n$, $I_2(e)$ and the braid group of the complex reflection group of type
$(e,e,n)$, endowed with the dual Garside structure, we may further assume the

how is this translated into energy dissipated or stored in the corona? This
question appears to have been given relatively little thought, as attention has
been focussed predominantly on mechanisms for the rapid dissipation of coronal
magnetic energy by way of MHD instabilities and plasma micro instabilities. We
consider three types of flare theory: the steady state ""photospheric dynamo""
model in which flare power represents coronal dissipation of currents generated
simultaneously by sub-photospheric flows; the ""magnetic energy storage"" model
where sub-photospheric flows again induce coronal currents but which in this
case are built up over a longer period before being released suddenly; and
""emerging flux"" models, in which new magnetic flux rising to the photosphere
already contains free energy, and does not require subsequent stressing by
photospheric motions. We conclude that photospheric dynamos can power only very
minor flares; that coronal energy storage can in principle meet the
requirements of a major flare, although perhaps not the very largest flares,
but that difficulties in coupling efficiently to the energy source may limit
this mechanism to moderate sized flares; and that emerging magnetic flux tubes,
generated in the solar interior, can carry sufficient free energy to power even
the largest flares ever observed.

quantization is a fundamental problem undermining the significance of the
predictions of quantum field theory. Inequivalent quantizations lead to
different physics. Recently, however, some uniqueness results have been
obtained for fields in non-stationary settings. In particular, for vacua that
are invariant under the background symmetries, a unitary implementation of the
classical evolution suffices to pick up a unique Fock quantization in the case
of Klein-Gordon fields with time-dependent mass, propagating in a static
spacetime whose spatial sections are three-spheres. In fact, the field equation
can be reinterpreted as describing the propagation in a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime after a suitable scaling of the field by a
function of time. For this class of fields, we prove here an even stronger
result about the Fock quantization: the uniqueness persists when one allows for
linear time-dependent transformations of the field in order to account for a
scaling by background functions. In total, paying attention to the dynamics,
there exists a preferred choice of quantum field, and only one
$SO(4)$-invariant Fock representation for it that respects the standard

Spitzer spectra of a hard X-ray (14 -- 195 keV) selected sample of nearby (z <
0.05) AGN detected by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) aboard Swift. The
luminosity distribution for the mid-infrared emission-lines, [O IV] 25.89
micron, [Ne II] 12.81 micron, [Ne III] 15.56 micron and [Ne V] 14.32/24.32
micron, and hard X-ray continuum show no differences between Seyfert 1 and
Seyfert 2 populations, however six newly discovered BAT AGNs are under-luminous
in [O IV], most likely the result of dust extinction in the host galaxy. The
overall tightness of the mid-infrared correlations and BAT fluxes and
luminosities suggests that the emission lines primarily arise in gas ionized by
the AGN. We also compare the mid-infrared emission-lines in the BAT AGNs with
those from published studies of ULIRGs, PG QSOs, star-forming galaxies and
LINERs. We find that the BAT AGN sample fall into a distinctive region when
comparing the [Ne III]/[Ne II] and the [O IV]/[Ne III] ratios. These line
ratios are lower in sources that have been previously classified in the
mid-infrared/optical as AGN than those found for the BAT AGN, suggesting that,
in our X-ray selected sample, the AGN represents the main contribution to the
observed line emission. These ratios represent a new emission line diagnostic
for distinguishing between AGN and star forming galaxies.

holes enter the band of a gravitational wave detector with significant
eccentricity. To avoid missing these signals or biasing parameter estimation it
is important that we consider waveform models that account for eccentricity.
The ingredients needed to compute post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms produced by
spinning black holes inspiralling on quasi-eccentric orbits have been available
for almost two decades at 2 PN order, and this work has recently been extended
to 2.5 PN order. However, the computational cost of directly implementing these
waveforms is high, requiring many steps per orbit to evolve the system of
coupled differential equations. Here we employ the standard techniques of a
separation of timescales and a generalized Keplerian parameterization of the
orbits to produce efficient waveforms describing spinning black hole binaries
with arbitrary masses and spins on quasi-eccentric orbits to 1.5 PN order. We
separate the fast orbital timescale from the slow spin-orbit precession
timescale by solving for the orbital motion in a non-interial frame of
reference that follows the orbital precession. We outline a scheme for
extending our approach to higher post-Newtonian order.

additional condition is satisfied. The agreement is based on complex numbers
and is justified if the designer receives messages from the agents through some

without adjustment, ERGMs preserve density as network size increases. Density
invariance is often not appropriate for social networks. We suggest a simple
modification based on an offset which instead preserves the mean degree and
accommodates changes in network composition asymptotically. We demonstrate that
this approach allows ERGMs to be applied to the important situation of
egocentrically sampled data. We analyze data from the National Health and
Social Life Survey (NHSLS).

FLIP-neighborhood, in which exactly one node changes the partition. Schaeffer
and Yannakakis (SICOMP, 1991) showed PLS-completeness of this problem on graphs
with unbounded degree. On the other side, Poljak (SICOMP, 1995) showed that in
cubic graphs every FLIP local search takes O(n^2) steps, where n is the number
of nodes. Due to the huge gap between degree three and unbounded degree,
Ackermann, Roeglin, and Voecking (JACM, 2008) asked for the smallest d for
which the local Max-Cut problem with FLIP-neighborhood on graphs with maximum
degree d is PLS-complete. In this paper, we prove that the computation of a
local optimum on graphs with maximum degree five is PLS-complete. Thus, we
solve the problem posed by Ackermann et al. almost completely by showing that d
is either four or five (unless PLS is in P). On the other side, we also prove
that on graphs with degree O(log n) every FLIP local search has probably
polynomial smoothed complexity. Roughly speaking, for any instance, in which
the edge weights are perturbated by a (Gaussian) random noise with variance
\sigma^2, every FLIP local search terminates in time polynomial in n and
\sigma^{-1}, with probability 1-n^{-\Omega(1)}. Putting both results together,
we may conclude that although local Max-Cut is likely to be hard on graphs with
bounded degree, it can be solved in polynomial time for slightly perturbated
instances with high probability.

the memory of Maxwell's demon in this way implies that work can be extracted
from a single thermal reservoir at a cost of angular momentum and an increase
in total entropy. The implications of this for the second law of thermodynamics
are assessed.
