renormalisation constant for the quark field, $Z_q$, from lattice simulations
with twisted mass quarks and three values of the lattice spacing. We use the
RI'-MOM scheme. $Z_q$ has very large lattice spacing artefacts; it is
considered here as a test bed to elaborate accurate methods which will be used
for other renormalisation constants. We recall and develop the non-perturbative
correction methods and propose tools to test the quality of the correction.
These tests are also applied to the perturbative correction method. We check
that the lattice spacing artefacts scale indeed as $a^2p^2$. We then study the
running of $Z_q$ with particular attention to the non-perturbative effects,
presumably dominated by the dimension-two gluon condensate $\VEV{A^2}$ in
Landau gauge. We show indeed that this effect is present, and not small. We
check its scaling in physical units confirming that it is a continuum effect.
It gives a $\sim 4%$ contribution at 2 GeV. Different variants are used in
order to test the reliability of our result and estimate the systematic
uncertainties. Finally combining all our results and using the known Wilson
coefficient of $\VEV{A^2}$ we find $g^2(\mu^2) \VEV{A^2}_{\mu^2\; CM} =
  2.01(11)(^{+0.61}_{- 0.73}) \;\mathrm {GeV}^2$ at $\mu=10\, \mathrm{GeV}$, in
fair agreement within uncertainties with the value indepently extracted from
the strong coupling constant.

offers rigorous convergence diagnostics even though history dependent,
non-Markovian dynamics are employed. It makes use of a greedy optimization
scheme in order to obtain sparse representations of the free energy function
which can be particularly useful in multidimensional cases. It employs
embarrassingly parallelizable sampling schemes that are based on adaptive

allows us to control the trade-off between the circuit complexity and the
dimension of the compressed quantum state. We give a formula that describes the
trade-off, and further analyze how the formula is affected by the controlling
parameter of the recursive procedure. Our recursive lossless compression can be
applied in a quantum multicast network where the source outputs homogeneous
quantum states (many copies of a quantum state) to a set of destinations
through a bottleneck. Such a recursive lossless compression is extremely useful
in the current situation where the technology of producing large-scale quantum
circuits is limited. Second, we develop two lossless compression schemes that
work for heterogeneous quantum states (many copies of a set of quantum states)
when the set of quantum states satisfies a certain structure. The heterogeneous
compression schemes provide extra compressing power over the homogeneous
compression scheme. Finally, we realize our heterogeneous compression schemes
in several quantum multicast networks, including the single-source
multi-terminal model, the multi-source multi-terminal model, and the ring
networks. We then analyze the bandwidth requirements for these network models.

covering this field and providing a spatial resolution of about 0.8 kpc at the
redshift of the galaxies. Despite of the narrow wavelength baseline covered
(1000 Angstrom), sampling approximatively the emission dominated by the same
stellar population, we detect significant radial colour variations in 50 per
cent of our sample. In particular, we find five ETGs with positive colour
gradients (cores bluer than the external regions), and five galaxies with
negative colour gradients (cores redder than the external regions), as commonly
observed in the local Universe. These results show that at 1 < z < 2, when the
Universe was only 3-4 Gyr old, ETGs constituted a composite population of
galaxies whose different assembly histories have generated different stellar
distributions with the bluest stellar population either in the center or in the
outskirts as well as throughout the whole galaxy. Moreover, we find that
compact galaxies seem to preferentially show a blue cores while moving towards
normal galaxies, central stellar populations become progressively redder.
Nonetheless, the narrow baseline covered together with the low statistics still
prevent us to be conclusive about a possible physical connection between colour
gradients and the degree of compactness of high-z ETGs.

liquid inside a confining microfluidic geometry. The jet breakup can occur
right after the nozzle in a phenomenon named dripping or through the generation
of a liquid jet that breaks up a long distance from the nozzle, which is called
jetting. Traditionally, these two regimes have been considered to reflect the
existence of two kinds of spatiotemporal instabilities of a fluid jet, the
dripping regime corresponding to an absolutely unstable jet and the jetting
regime to a convectively unstable jet. Here, we present quantitative
measurements of the dripping and jetting regimes, both in an unforced and a
forced state, and compare these measurements with recent theoretical studies of
spatiotemporal instability of a confined liquid jet in a co-flowing liquid. In
the unforced state, the frequency of oscillation and breakup of the liquid jet
is measured and compared to the theoretical predictions. The dominant frequency
of the jet oscillations as a function of the inner flow rate agrees
qualitatively with the theoretical predictions in the jetting regime but not in
the dripping regime. In the forced state, achieved with periodic laser heating,
the dripping regime is found to be insensitive to the perturbation and the
frequency of drop formation remains unaltered. The jetting regime, on the
contrary, amplifies the externally imposed frequency, which translates in the
formation of drops at the frequency imposed by the external forcing. In
conclusion, the dripping and jetting regimes are found to exhibit the main
features of absolutely and convectively unstable flows respectively, but the
frequency selection in the dripping regime is not ruled by the absolute
frequency predicted by the stability analysis.

from two Hankel forms in $\C^m$. From Vandermonde factorizations of the two
associated Hankel matrices $H_x$ and $H_y$, the Hankel forms can be easily
calculated, thus yielding points on the B\'ezier curve. Here, a new proof of
the existence of a Vandermonde factorization of regular Hankel matrix is given
from Pascal matrices techniques. But, even when the Hankel matrix associated to
the form is singular, the method can still be used by shifting its
skew-diagonal and counteracting it after, which is pratically done without
costs.. By comparing this new method with a Pascal matrix method and
Casteljau's, we see that the results suggest that this new method is very
effective with regard to accuracy and time of computation for various values of
n.

viscous shear flows is taken into exam. We discuss the possibility that a
vesicle be able to control the drift in an external shear flow, by varying
locally the bending rigidity of its own membrane. By analytical calculation in
the quasi-spherical limit, the stationary shape and the orientation of the
tank-treading vesicle in the external flow, are determined, working to lowest
order in the membrane inhomogeneity. The membrane inhomogeneity acts in the
shape evolution equation as an additional force term, that can be used to
balance the effect of the hydrodynamic stresses, thus allowing the vesicle to
assume shapes and orientations that would otherwise be forbidden. The vesicle
shapes and orientations required for migration transverse to the flow, together
with the bending rigidity profiles that would lead to such shapes and
orientations, are determined. A simple model is presented, in which a vesicle
is able to migrate up or down the gradient of a concentration field, by
stiffening or softening of its membrane, in response to the variations in the
concentration level experienced during tank-treading.

Especially in mammals the neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus form a
biological clock regulating the activity-inactivity cycle of the animal. This
clock is stimulated by the natural 24-hour light-dark cycle. In our model of
this system we consider each neuron as a so called phase oscillator, coupled to
other neurons for which the light-dark cycle is a Zeitgeber. To simplify the
model we first take an externally stimulated single phase oscillator. The first
part of the phase interval is called the active state and the remaining part is
the inactive state. Without external stimulus the oscillator oscillates with
its intrinsic period. An external stimulus, be it from activity of neighboring
cells or the periodic daylight cycle, acts twofold, it may delay the change
form active to inactive and it may advance the return to the active state. The
amount of delay and advance depends on the strength of the stimulus. We use a
circle map as a mathematical model for this system. This map depends on several
parameters, among which the intrinsic period and phase delay and advance. In
parameter space we find Arnol'd tongues where the system is in resonance with
the Zeitgeber. Thus already in this simplified system we find entrainment and
synchronization. Also some other phenomena from biological experiments and
observations can be related to the dynamical behavior of the circle map.

  http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/research/stats/reports/2010/",,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Switching state-space models (SSSM) are a very popular class of time series
models that have found many applications in statistics, econometrics and
advanced signal processing. Bayesian inference for these models typically
relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. However, even
sophisticated MCMC methods dedicated to SSSM can prove quite inefficient as
they update potentially strongly correlated discrete-valued latent variables
one-at-a-time (Carter and Kohn, 1996; Gerlach et al., 2000; Giordani and Kohn,
2008). Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) methods are a recently
developed class of MCMC algorithms which use particle filters to build
efficient proposal distributions in high-dimensions (Andrieu et al., 2010). The
existing PMCMC methods of Andrieu et al. (2010) are applicable to SSSM, but are
restricted to employing standard particle filtering techniques. Yet, in the
context of discrete-valued latent variables, specialised particle techniques
have been developed which can outperform by up to an order of magnitude
standard methods (Fearnhead, 1998; Fearnhead and Clifford, 2003; Fearnhead,
2004). In this paper we develop a novel class of PMCMC methods relying on these
very efficient particle algorithms. We establish the theoretical validy of this
new generic methodology referred to as discrete PMCMC and demonstrate it on a
variety of examples including a multiple change-points model for well-log data
and a model for U.S./U.K. exchange rate data. Discrete PMCMC algorithms are
shown to outperform experimentally state-of-the-art MCMC techniques for a fixed
computational complexity. Additionally they can be easily parallelized (Lee et
al., 2010) which allows further substantial gains.

the flagellum based on Kirchhoff's theory of an elastic rod that describes such
a polymorphic transformation and use resistive force theory to couple the
flagellum to the aqueous environment. We present Brownian dynamics simulations
that quantitatively reproduce the force-extension curves and study how the
ratio $\Gamma$ of torsional to bending rigidity and the extensional rate
influence the response of the flagellum. An upper bound for $\Gamma$ is given.

the logarithm of the extensional rate.

dynamics of LQG:(i) the (triangulated) Hamiltonian constraint acts only on
vertices, its construction involves some of the same ambiguities as in LQG and
its action on diffeomorphism invariant states admits a continuum limit (ii)if
the regulating holonomies are in representations tailored to the edge labels of
the state, all previously obtained physical states lie in the kernel of the
Hamiltonian constraint, (iii) the commutator of two (density weight 1)
Hamiltonian constraints as well as the operator correspondent of their
classical Poisson bracket converge to zero in the continuum limit defined by
diffeomorphism invariant states, and vanish on the Lewandowski- Marolf (LM)

decomposed into irreducible $N$-body parts. The irreducible $N$-body
contribution to the vacuum energy is finite if the common intersection $O_1\cap

perturbative expansion of the corresponding irreducible $N$-body spectral
function $\tphi^{(N)}(\beta)$ for $\beta\sim 0$ vanishes to all orders even if
some of the objects intersect. These irreducible spectral functions and their
associated Casimir energies in principle can be computed numerically or
approximated semiclassically without regularization or implicit knowledge of
the spectrum. They are analytic in the parameters describing the relative
orientation and position of the individual objects and remain finite when some,
but not all, of the $N$ objects overlap. The Feynman-Kac theorem is used to
compute Casimir energies of a massless scalar field with potential scattering
and the finiteness of $N$-body Casimir energies is shown explicitly in this
case. The irreducible $N$-body contributions to the vacuum energy of a massless
scalar field with potential interactions is shown to be negative for an even-

illustrate the analyticity of the $N$-body Casimir energy and its sign. A
multiple scattering representation of the irreducible three-body Casimir energy
is given. It remains finite when any two of the three objects overlap.

extreme wave in an asymptotically self-similar manner, we find that standing
waves behave differently. Instead of sharpening to a corner or cusp as
previously conjectured, the crest tip develops a variety of oscillatory
structures. This causes the bifurcation curve that parametrizes these waves to
fragment into disjoint branches corresponding to the different oscillation
patterns that occur. In many cases, a vertical jet of fluid pushes these
structures upward, leading to wave profiles commonly seen in wave tank
experiments. Thus, we observe a rich array of dynamic behavior at small length

that there is about a 0.2% chance of getting such a signal anywhere in the

with flarelike events in hot coronal loops. In this paper, a review of the
observed properties and the theoretical modeling is presented. Statistical
measurements of physical parameters (period, decay time, and amplitude) have
been obtained based on a large number of events observed by SOHO/SUMER and
Yohkoh/BCS. Several pieces of evidence are found to support their
interpretation in terms of the fundamental standing longitudinal slow mode. The
high excitation rate of these oscillations in small- or micro-flares suggest
that the slow mode waves are a natural response of the coronal plasma to
impulsive heating in closed magnetic structure. The strong damping and the
rapid excitation of the observed waves are two major aspects of the waves that
are poorly understood, and are the main subject of theoretical modeling. The
slow waves are found mainly damped by thermal conduction and viscosity in hot
coronal loops. The mode coupling seems to play an important role in rapid
excitation of the standing slow mode. Several seismology applications such as
determination of the magnetic field, temperature, and density in coronal loops
are demonstrated. Further, some open issues are discussed.

and investigate whether the accreted gas was shocked to high temperatures
before reaching a galaxy. For this purpose we use a suite of large
cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the OWLS project. We improve on
previous work by considering a wider range of halo masses and redshifts, by
distinguishing accretion onto haloes and galaxies, by including important
feedback processes, and by comparing simulations with different physics. The
specific rate of gas accretion onto haloes is, like that for dark matter, only
weakly dependent on halo mass. For halo masses Mhalo>>10^11 Msun it is
relatively insensitive to feedback processes. In contrast, accretion rates onto
galaxies are determined by radiative cooling and by outflows driven by
supernovae and active galactic nuclei. Galactic winds increase the halo mass at
which the central galaxies grow the fastest by about two orders of magnitude to
Mhalo~10^12 Msun. Gas accretion is bimodal, with maximum past temperatures
either of order the virial temperature or <~10^5 K. The fraction of gas
accreted on to haloes in the hot mode is insensitive to feedback and metal-line
cooling. It increases with decreasing redshift, but is mostly determined by
halo mass, increasing gradually from less than 10% for ~10^11 Msun to greater
than 90% at 10^13 Msun. In contrast, for accretion onto galaxies the cold mode
is always significant and the relative contributions of the two accretion modes
are more sensitive to feedback and metal-line cooling. The majority of stars
present in any mass halo at any redshift were formed from gas accreted in the
cold mode, although the hot mode contributes typically over 10% for
Mhalo>~10^11 Msun. Galaxies, but not necessarily their gaseous haloes, are
predominantly fed by gas that did not experience an accretion shock when it
entered the host halo.

of galaxies and the mass of their host dark matter subhaloes can predict the
clustering of galaxies and its evolution with cosmic time. In this paper we
study the assumptions made by this methodology using a semi-analytical model
(SAM). To this end, we randomly swap between the locations of model galaxies
within a narrow range of subhalo mass (M_infall). We find that shuffled samples
of galaxies have different auto-correlation functions in comparison with the
original model galaxies. This difference is significant even if central and
satellite galaxies are allowed to follow a different relation between M_infall
and stellar mass, and can reach a factor of 2 for massive galaxies at redshift
zero. We analyze three features within SAMs that contribute to this effect: a)
The relation between stellar mass and subhalo mass evolves with redshift for
central galaxies, affecting satellite galaxies at the time of infall. b) The
stellar mass of galaxies falling into groups and clusters at high redshift is
different from the mass of central galaxies at the same time. c) The stellar
mass growth for satellite galaxies after infall can be significant and depends
on the infall redshift and the group mass. We show that the above is true for
differing SAMs, and that the effect is sensitive to the treatment of dynamical
friction and stripping of gas in satellite galaxies. We find that by using the
FoF group mass at redshift zero in addition to M_infall, an empirical model is
able to accurately reproduce the clustering properties of galaxies. On the
other hand, using the infall redshift as a second parameter does not yield as
good results because it is less correlated with stellar mass. Our analysis
indicates that environmental processes are important for modeling the
clustering and abundance of galaxies. (Abridged)

more massive haloes showing a stronger tendency to reside near peaks initially.
We identify a small but significant fraction of haloes that appear to evolve
from peaks of substantially lower mass than that of the halo itself. We refer
to these as ""peakless haloes"" for convenience. By contrasting directly the
properties of these objects with the bulk of the proto-halo population we find
two clear differences: 1) their initial shapes are significantly flatter and
more elongated than the predominantly triaxial majority, and 2) they are, on
average, more strongly compressed by tidal forces associated with their
surrounding large scale structure. Using the two-point correlation function we
show that peakless haloes tend to emerge from highly clustered regions of the
initial density field implying that, at fixed mass, the accretion geometry and
mass accretion histories of haloes in highly clustered environments differ
significantly from those in the field. This may have important implications for
understanding the origin of the halo assembly bias, of galaxy properties in
dense environments and how environment affects the morphological transformation
of galaxies near groups and rich galaxy clusters.

at high local density regions is larger than at low local density regions. The
velocity field tends to be more laminar along the direction towards the minor

consists of two distinct components, a nearly edge-on disk or ring, and a
swept-back feature, the result of interaction with the interstellar medium. We
resolve both components at unprecedented resolution with VLT/NACO H-band
imaging. Using optimized angular differential imaging techniques to remove the
light of the star, we reveal the disk component as a distinct narrow ring at
inclination i=84.3 \pm 1.0{\deg}. We determine a semi-major axis of a=61.25 \pm
0.85 AU and an eccentricity of e=0.045 \pm 0.015, assuming that periastron is
located along the apparent disk major axis. Therefore, the ring center is
offset from the star by at least 2.75 \pm 0.85 AU. The offset, together with a
relatively steep inner rim, could indicate a planetary companion that perturbs
the remnant planetesimal belt. From our imaging data we set upper mass limits
for companions that exclude any object above the deuterium-burning limit for
separations down to 0.3"". The ring shows a strong brightness asymmetry along
both the major and minor axis. A brighter front side could indicate
forward-scattering grains, while the brightness difference between the NE and
SW components can be only partly explained by the ring center offset,
suggesting additional density enhancements on one side of the ring. The

close-in orbits) are actually orbiting counter to the spin direction of the
star. Perturbations from a distant binary star companion can produce high
inclinations, but cannot explain orbits that are retrograde with respect to the
total angular momentum of the system. Such orbits in a stellar context can be
produced through secular (that is, long term) perturbations in hierarchical
triple-star systems. Here we report a similar analysis of planetary bodies,
including both octupole-order effects and tidal friction, and find that we can
produce hot Jupiters in orbits that are retrograde with respect to the total
angular momentum. With distant stellar mass perturbers, such an outcome is not
possible. With planetary perturbers, the inner orbit's angular momentum
component parallel to the total angular momentum need not be constant. In fact,
as we show here, it can even change sign, leading to a retrograde orbit. A
brief excursion to very high eccentricity during the chaotic evolution of the
inner orbit allows planet-star tidal interactions to rapidly circularize that
orbit, decoupling the planets and forming a retrograde hot Jupiter.

We use Monte Carlo simulations to derive the shear directly from measurements

of the shear obtained from lens modeling. We account for possible tidal
stripping of the group galaxies by varying the fraction of total mass
apportioned between the group dark matter halo and individual group galaxies.
The environment produces an average shear of gamma = 0.08 (ranging from 0.02 to
0.17), significant enough to affect quantities derived from lens observables.
However, the direction and magnitude of the shears do not match those obtained
from lens modeling in three of the six 4-image systems in our sample (B1422,
RXJ1131, and WFI2033). The source of this disagreement is not clear, implying
that the assumptions inherent in both the environment and lens model approaches
must be reconsidered. If only the local group environment of the lens is
included, the average shear is gamma = 0.05 (ranging from 0.01 to 0.14),
indicating that line-of-sight contributions to the lens potential are not
negligible. We isolate the effects of various theoretical and observational
uncertainties on our results. Of those uncertainties, the scatter in the
Faber-Jackson relation and error in the group centroid position dominate.
Future surveys of lens environments should prioritize spectroscopic sampling of

controversy. While Goldreich-Sridhar model (1995) predicts Kolmogorov's -5/3
slope of turbulence, shallower slopes were often reported by numerical studies.
We argue that earlier numerics was affected by driving due to a diffuse
locality of energy transfer in MHD case. Our highest-resolution simulation
(3072^2x1024) has been able to reach the asymptotic -5/3 regime of the energy
slope. Additionally, we found that so-called dynamic alignment, proposed in the
model with -3/2 slope, saturates and therefore can not affect asymptotic slope.
The observation of the asymptotic regime allowed us to measure Kolmogorov
constant C_KA=3.2+-0.2 for purely Alfv\'enic turbulence and C_K=4.1+-0.3 for
full MHD turbulence. These values are much higher than the hydrodynamic value
of 1.64. The larger value of Kolmogorov constant is an indication of a fairly
inefficient energy transfer and, as we show in this Letter, is in theoretical
agreement with our observation of diffuse locality. We also explain what has
been missing in numerical studies that reported shallower slopes.

enrichment, in which outflows expand anisotropically along the direction of
least resistance, distributing metals into the IGM. The metals carried by the
outflows are generated by two separate stellar populations: stars located near
the central AGN, and stars located in the greater galaxy. Using this algorithm,
we performed a series of 5 simulations of the propagation of AGN-driven
outflows in a cosmological volume of size (128/h Mpc)^3 in a Lambda-CDM
universe, and analyze the resulting metal enrichment of the IGM. We found that
the metallicity induced in the IGM is greatly dominated by AGNs having
bolometric luminosity L > 10^9 L_sun, sources with 10^8 < L / L_sun < 10^9
having a negligible contribution. Our simulations produced an average IGM
metallicity of [O/H] = -5 at z = 5.5, which then rises gradually, and remains
relatively flat at a value [O/H] = -2.8 between z = 2 and z = 0. The ejection
of metals from AGN host galaxies by AGN-driven outflows is found to enrich the
IGM to > 10 - 20% of the observed values, the number dependent on redshift. The
enriched IGM volume fractions are small at z > 3, then rise rapidly to the
following values at z = 0: 6 - 10% of the volume enriched to [O/H] > -2.5, 14 -
24% volume to [O/H] > -3, and 34 - 45% volume to [O/H] > -4. At z > 2, there is
a gradient of the induced enrichment, the metallicity decreasing with
increasing IGM density, enriching the underdense IGM to higher metallicities, a
trend more prominent with increasing anisotropy of the outflows. This can
explain observations of metal-enriched low-density IGM at z = 3 - 4.

formed on the surface. For the Si-face, layer-by-layer growth of the graphene
is observed in areas between the step bunches. At 1170 C, for the C-face, a
more 3-dimensional type of growth is found. The average thickness is then about
4 ML, but with a wide variation in local thickness (2 - 7 ML) over the surface.
The spatial arrangement of constant-thickness domains are found to be
correlated with step bunches on the surface, which form in a more restricted
manner than at 1320 C. It is argued that these domains are somewhat
disconnected, so that no strong driving force for planarization of the film
exists. In a 1-atm argon environment, permitting higher growth temperatures,
the graphene morphology for the Si-face is found to become more
layer-by-layer-like even for graphene thickness as low as 1 ML. However, for
the C-face the morphology becomes much worse, with the surface displaying
markedly inhomogeneous nucleation of the graphene. It is demonstrated that
these surfaces are unintentionally oxidized, which accounts for the
inhomogeneous growth.

  Anonymization",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the last decade there have been great strides made in developing
techniques to compute functions privately. In particular, Differential Privacy
gives strong promises about conclusions that can be drawn about an individual.
In contrast, various syntactic methods for providing privacy (criteria such as
kanonymity and l-diversity) have been criticized for still allowing private
information of an individual to be inferred. In this report, we consider the
ability of an attacker to use data meeting privacy definitions to build an
accurate classifier. We demonstrate that even under Differential Privacy, such
classifiers can be used to accurately infer ""private"" attributes in realistic
data. We compare this to similar approaches for inferencebased attacks on other
forms of anonymized data. We place these attacks on the same scale, and observe
that the accuracy of inference of private attributes for Differentially Private
data and l-diverse data can be quite similar.

starting from an $N$-particle ideal gas of mixed symmetry with three-body
nodes, which has double occupation of the lowest harmonic oscillator orbital

ground state of a Tonks-Girardeau gas, but is more complicated. It is proved
that in 1D any system of $N\ge 3$ bosons with three-body hard-core interactions
also has two-body soft-core interactions of generalized Lieb-Liniger delta
function form, as a consequence of the topology of the configuration space of
$N$ particles in 1D, i.e., wave functions with \emph{only} three-body hard core
zeroes are topologically impossible. This is in contrast with the case of 2D,
where pure three-body hard-core interactions do exist, and are closely related
to the fractional quantized Hall effect. The exact ground state is compared
with a previously-proposed Pfaffian-like approximate ground state, which
satisfies the three-body hard-core constraint but is not an exact energy
eigenstate. Both the exact ground state and the Pfaffian-like approximation
imply two-body soft-core interactions as well as three-body hard-core

caused by the same physical process. As motivation, we note that Linde's simple
chaotic inflation $V=(1/2)m^{2}\phi^{2}$ produces values of $n_{s}=0.967$ and
$r=0.13$, which are consistent with the WMAP 1-sigma error bars. We therefore
propose $V=(1/2)m_{2}^{2}\phi_{2}^{2}+(1/2)m_{1}^{2}\phi_{1}^{2}$ with
$m_{1}\sim10^{-5}$ and $m_{2}\leq10^{-60}$, where $c=1=\hbar$ and the reduced
Planck mass is set to unity. The field $\phi_{1}$ drives inflation and has
damped by now ($\phi_{1,0}=0$), while $\phi_{2}$ is currently rolling down its
potential to produce dark energy. Using this model, we derive the formula
$\delta w(z)\equiv w(z)+1=\delta w_{0}(H_0/H(z))^2$ via the slow-roll
approximation. Our numerical results from exact and self-consistent solution of
the equations of motion for $\phi_2$ and the Friedmann equations support this
formula, and it should hold for any slow-roll dark energy.
  Our potential can be easily realized in N-flation models with many fields,
and is easily falsifiable by upcoming experiments -- for example, if Linde's
chaotic inflation is ruled out. But if $r$ values consistent with Linde's
chaotic inflation are detected then one should take this model seriously
indeed.

widely considered as mysterious, but hints for it have been in fact detected in
several astronomical observations at optical, infrared, and radio wavelengths.
We call attention to the nature of galaxy merging, the observed rapid
microlensing of a quasar, the detection of ""cometary knots"" in planetary
nebulae, and the Lyman-alpha clouds as optical phenomena revealing the compact
objects. Radio observations of ""extreme scattering events"" and ""parabolic arcs""
and microwave observations of ""cold dust cirrus"" clouds are observed at 15 - 20
K temperatures are till now not considered in a unifying picture. Aims: The
theory of gravitational hydrodynamics predicts galactic dark matter arises from
Jeans clusters that are made up of almost a trillion micro brown dwarfs (mBDs)
of earth weight. It is intended to explain the aforementioned anomalous
observations and to make predictions within this framework. Methods: We employ
analytical isothermal modeling to estimate various effects. Results: Estimates
of their total number show that they comprise enough mass to constitute the
missing baryonic matter. Mysterious radio events are explained by mBD pair
merging in the Galaxy. The ""dust"" temperature of cold galaxy halos arises from
a thermostat setting due to a slow release of latent heat at the 14 K gas to
solid transition at the mBD surface. The proportionality of the central black
hole mass of a galaxy and its number of globular clusters is explained. The
visibility of an early galaxy at redshift 8.6 is obvious with most hydrogen
locked up in mBDs. Conclusions: Numerical simulations of various steps would
further test the approach. It looks promising to redo MACHO searches against
the Magellanic clouds.

experimentally detectable signal and a sufficiently accurate measurement. This
is illustrated by explicitly considering two key examples: First, for a weakly
interacting three-dimensional Bose gas it reproduces the expected result that
below the critical temperature the superfluid fraction closely follows the
condensate fraction. Second, it allows a clear quantitative differentiation of
the superfluid and the condensate density in a strongly interacting Bose gas.

  This technique to measure the turbulent response in a DNS numerical

linear response concept is invoked either by resorting to renormalized
perturbations theories or by introducing the well-known Fluctuation-Dissipation

  Though the results obtained in the present work are limited to relatively low

characteristic form and the time scaling properties of the response function
are investigated in the universal subrange of dissipative wavenumbers; a
comparison with the response approximation given by the FDR is proposed through
the independent DNS measurement of the correlation function. Very good

length, such as Planck length \cite{Floratos,Kempf}. It is natural to ask how
the existence of a minimal length may modify the results in elementary quantum
mechanics (QM) problems familiar to us \cite{Gasiorowicz}. In this paper we
address a simple problem from elementary non-relativistic quantum mechanics,
called ""particle in a box"", where the usual continuum (1+1)-space-time is
supplanted by a space-time lattice. Our lattice consists of a grid of
$\lambda_0 \times \tau_0 $ rectangles, where $\lambda_0$, the lattice
parameter, is a fundamental length (say Planck length) and, we take $\tau_0$ to
be equal to $\lambda_0/c$. The corresponding Schrodinger equation becomes a
difference equation, the solution of which yields the $q$-eigenfunctions and
$q$-eigenvalues of the energy operator as a function of $\lambda_0 $. The
$q$-eigenfunctions form an orthonormal set and both $q$-eigenfunctions and
$q$-eigenvalues reduce to continuum solutions as $ \lambda_0 \rightarrow 0 .$
The corrections to eigenvalues because of the assumed lattice is shown to be
$O(\lambda_0^2).$ We then compute the uncertainties in position and momentum,
$\Delta x, \Delta p$ for the box problem and study the consequent modification
of Heisenberg uncertainty relation due to the assumption of space-time lattice,
in contrast to modifications suggested by other investigations such as
\cite{Floratos}.

isomorphism class (over the integers) of the Hopf algebra $H_*(\Omega\Sigma X;

$H_*(\Omega\Sigma X; \coefZ)$ is isomorphic to a Lie-Hopf algebra, that is, to
a primitively generated Hopf algebra. We show that for a given $X$ these
invariants are obstructions to the existence of a homotopy equivalence $\Sigma

  Further on, using the notion of Hopf algebras, we establish new structural
properties of the cohomology ring, in particular, of the cup product. For
example, using the fact that the suspension of a polyhedral product $X$ is a
double suspension, we obtain a strong condition on the cohomology ring
structure of $X$. This gives an important application in toric topology. For an
algebra to be realised as the cohomology ring of a moment-angle manifold $\Z_P$
associated to a simple polytope $P$, we found an obstruction in the Hopf
algebra $H_*(\Omega\Sigma \Z_P)$.

of random bits needed for each party to $\Theta(\ell+\log n)$, where $\ell$ is
the security parameter, as long as $W$ has min-entropy $n^{\Omega(1)}$.
Previously, the best known result needs to use $\Theta((\ell+\log n)\log n)$
bits. Our result is also asymptotically optimal. Second, we generalize the
problem to the case where the two parties only have local weak random sources
instead of truly uniform random bits. We show that when each party has a local
weak random source with min-entropy $> n/2$, there is an efficient privacy
amplification protocol that works nearly as good as if the two parties have
access to local uniform random bits. Next, in the case where each party only
has a weak random source with arbitrarily linear min-entropy, we give an
efficient privacy amplification protocol where we can achieve security
parameter up to $\Omega(\log k)$. Our results give the first protocols that
achieve privacy amplification when each party only has access to a local weak
random source.

implications to a wide range of cellular processes. Using several simple
models, we show that one class of bistable chemical systems has a deterministic
counterpart in the nonlinear dynamics based on the Law of Mass Action, while
another class, widely known as noise-induced stochastic bistability, does not.
Observing the system's volume ($V$) playing a similar role as the inverse
temperature ($\beta$) in classical rate theory, an van't Hoff-Arrhenius like
analysis is introduced. In one-dimensional systems, a transition rate between
two states, represented in terms of a barrier in the landscape for the dynamics
$\Phi(x,V)$, $k\propto\exp\{-V\Delta\Phi^{\ddag}(V)\}$, can be understood from
a decomposition $\Delta\Phi^{\ddag}(V) \approx\Delta\phi_0^{\ddag}
\Delta\phi_1^{\ddag}/V$. Nonlinear bistability means $\Delta\phi_0^{\ddag}>0$
while stochastic bistability has $\Delta\phi_0^{\ddag}<0$ but
$\Delta\phi_1^{\ddag}>0$. Stochastic bistabilities can be viewed as remants (or
""ghosts) of nonlinear bifurcations or extinction phenomenon, and
$\Delta\phi_0^{\ddag}$ and $\Delta\phi_1^{\ddag}$ as ""enthalpic"" and ""entropic""

"1011.2571","Vladimir Braverman","Vladimir Braverman and Rafail Ostrovsky","Recursive Sketching For Frequency Moments",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a ground-breaking paper, Indyk and Woodruff (STOC 05) showed how to
compute $F_k$ (for $k>2$) in space complexity $O(\mbox{\em poly-log}(n,m)\cdot
n^{1-\frac2k})$, which is optimal up to (large) poly-logarithmic factors in $n$
and $m$, where $m$ is the length of the stream and $n$ is the upper bound on
the number of distinct elements in a stream. The best known lower bound for
large moments is $\Omega(\log(n)n^{1-\frac2k})$. A follow-up work of
Bhuvanagiri, Ganguly, Kesh and Saha (SODA 2006) reduced the poly-logarithmic
factors of Indyk and Woodruff to $O(\log^2(m)\cdot (\log n+ \log m)\cdot
n^{1-{2\over k}})$. Further reduction of poly-log factors has been an elusive
goal since 2006, when Indyk and Woodruff method seemed to hit a natural
""barrier."" Using our simple recursive sketch, we provide a different yet simple
approach to obtain a $O(\log(m)\log(nm)\cdot (\log\log n)^4\cdot n^{1-{2\over
k}})$ algorithm for constant $\epsilon$ (our bound is, in fact, somewhat
stronger, where the $(\log\log n)$ term can be replaced by any constant number
of $\log $ iterations instead of just two or three, thus approaching $log^*n$.
Our bound also works for non-constant $\epsilon$ (for details see the body of
the paper). Further, our algorithm requires only $4$-wise independence, in
contrast to existing methods that use pseudo-random generators for computing
large frequency moments.

investigate the neural mechanism for generating complex sequential behaviors.
To relate the findings from studying birdsongs to other sequential behaviors,
it is crucial to characterize the statistical properties of the sequencing
rules in birdsongs. However, the properties of the sequencing rules in
birdsongs have not yet been fully addressed. In this study, we investigate the
statistical propertiesof the complex birdsong of the Bengalese finch (Lonchura
striata var. domestica). Based on manual-annotated syllable sequences, we first
show that there are significant higher-order context dependencies in Bengalese
finch songs, that is, which syllable appears next depends on more than one
previous syllable. This property is shared with other complex sequential
behaviors. We then analyze acoustic features of the song and show that
higher-order context dependencies can be explained using first-order hidden
state transition dynamics with redundant hidden states. This model corresponds
to hidden Markov models (HMMs), well known statistical models with a large
range of application for time series modeling. The song annotation with these
models with first-order hidden state dynamics agreed well with manual
annotation, the score was comparable to that of a second-order HMM, and
surpassed the zeroth-order model (the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)), which does
not use context information. Our results imply that the hierarchical
representation with hidden state dynamics may underlie the neural
implementation for generating complex sequences with higher-order dependencies.

result in either evaporation of the disk or condensation of the hot corona. At
low mass accretion rates, evaporation dominates and can completely remove the
inner disk. At higher mass accretion rates, condensation becomes more efficient
in the very inner regions, so that part of the mass accretes via a weak
(initially formed) inner disk which is separated from the outer disk by a fully
evaporated region at mid radii. At still higher mass accretion rates,
condensation dominates everywhere, so there is a continuous cool disk extending
to the innermost stable circular orbit. We extend these calculations by
including the effect of irradiation by the hot corona on the disk structure.
The flux which is not reflected is reprocessed in the disk, adding to the
intrinsic thermal emission from gravitational energy release. This increases
the seed photons for Compton cooling of the hot corona, enhancing condensation
of the hot flow and re-inforcing the residual inner disk rather than
evaporating it. Our calculations confirm that a residual inner disk can
co-exist with a hard, coronally dominated, spectrum over a range of $0.006<\dot
m<0.016$ (for $\alpha=0.2$). This provides an explanation for the weak thermal
component seen recently in the low/hard state of black hole X-ray binary

natural hardness assumption concerning the problem of approximating the edge

connected to the Unique Games Conjecture (Khot, STOC 2002). In particular, the
Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis implies the Unique Games Conjecture
(Raghavendra, Steurer, STOC 2010).
  Our main result is that the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis is in fact
equivalent to a variant of the Unique Games Conjecture. More precisely, the
hypothesis is equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture restricted to instance
with a fairly mild condition on the expansion of small sets. Alongside, we
obtain the first strong hardness of approximation results for the Balanced
Separator and Minimum Linear Arrangement problems. Before, no such hardness was
known for these problems even assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.
  These results not only establish the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis as a
natural unifying hypothesis that implies the Unique Games Conjecture, all its
consequences and, in addition, hardness results for other problems like
Balanced Separator and Minimum Linear Arrangement, but our results also show
that the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis problem lies at the combinatorial heart
of the Unique Games Conjecture.
  The key technical ingredient is a new way of exploiting the structure of the
Unique Games instances obtained from the Small-Set Expansion Hypothesis via
(Raghavendra, Steurer, 2010). This additional structure allows us to modify
standard reductions in a way that essentially destroys their local-gadget
nature. Using this modification, we can argue about the expansion in the graphs
produced by the reduction without relying on expansion properties of the
underlying Unique Games instance (which would be impossible for a local-gadget
reduction).

numerous computational and other applications. Due to its application in
practice, speeding up the computation of a Johnson-Lindenstrauss style
dimension reduction is an important question. Recently, Dasgupta, Kumar, and
Sarlos (STOC 2010) constructed such a transform that uses a sparse matrix. This
is motivated by the desire to speed up the computation when applied to sparse
input vectors, a scenario that comes up in applications. The sparsity of their
construction was further improved by Kane and Nelson (ArXiv 2010).
  We improve the previous bound on the number of non-zero entries per column of
Kane and Nelson from $O(1/\epsilon \log(1/\delta)\log(k/\delta))$ (where the
target dimension is $k$, the distortion is $1\pm \epsilon$, and the failure
probability is $\delta$) to $$ O\left({1\over\epsilon}
\left({\log(1/\delta)\log\log\log(1/\delta) \over
\log\log(1/\delta)}\right)^2\right). $$

results are obtained by connecting the moments of an order 2 Rademacher chaos
to the combinatorial properties of random Eulerian multigraphs. Estimating the
chance that a random multigraph is composed of a given number of node-disjoint
Eulerian components leads to a new tail bound on the chaos. Our estimates may
be of independent interest, and as this part of the argument is decoupled from
the analysis of the coefficients of the chaos, we believe that our methods can

tight-binding model is used to calculate the NW electronic structure.
Linearized Boltzmann transport theory is applied, including phonon and surface
roughness scattering (SRS) mechanisms, for the mobility calculation. We find
that large mobility enhancements (of the order of 4X) can be achieved as the
diameter of the [110] and even more that of the [111] NWs scales down to D=3nm.
This enhancement originates from the increase in the dispersion curvatures and
consequently the hole velocities as the diameter is scaled. This benefit over
compensates the mobility reduction caused by SRS as the diameter reduces. The
mobility of the [100] NWs, on the other hand, is the lowest compared the other
two NW orientations, and additionally suffers as the diameter scales. The
bandstructure engineering techniques we describe are a generic feature of
anisotropic bulk bands, and can be also applied to 2D thin-body-layers as well

we align only the sequences of nucleotides which constitute pairs between two
different RNAs, while the secondary structure of each RNA comes into play only
by the combinatorial factors affecting the entropc contribution of each

because of its dependence on a tabulated cooling curve, the introduction of

with our original time-series photometric data. In conjunction with X-ray
observations, we discuss the origin of its optical and X-ray afterglows.
Methods. We observed the optical afterglow of Swift burst GRB 061121 with the
Kanata 1.5-m telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory. Our observation covers
a period just after an X-ray plateau phase. We also performed deep imaging with
the Subaru telescope in 2010 in order to estimate the contamination of the host
galaxy. Results. In the light curve, we find that the optical afterglow also
exhibited a break as in the X-ray afterglow. However, our observation suggests
a possible hump structure or a flattening period before the optical break in
the light curve. There is no sign of such a hump in the X-ray light curve.
Conclusions. This implies that the emitting region of optical was distinct from
that of X-rays. The hump in the optical light curve was possibly caused by the
passage of the typical frequency of synchrotron emission from another forward
shock distinct from the early afterglow. The observed decay and spectral
indices are inconsistent with the standard synchrotron-shock model. Hence, the
observation requires a change in microphysical parameters in the shock region
or a prior activity of the central engine. Alternatively, the emission during
the shallow decay phase may be a composition of two forward shock emissions, as
indicated by the hump structure in the light curve.

plasma in a weakly stratified atmosphere, representing hot coronal loops. In
most of earlier studies a time-independent equilibrium is considered. Here we
abandon this restriction and allow the equilibrium to develop as function of
time. In particular, the background plasma is assumed to be cooling due to
thermal conduction. The cooling is assumed to be on a time scale greater than
the characteristic travel times of the perturbations. We investigate the
influence of cooling of the background plasma on the properties of
magneto-acoustic waves. The MHD equations are reduced to a 1-D system modelling
magneto-acoustic modes progressing along a dynamically cooling coronal loop. A
time dependent dispersion relation which describes the propagation of the
magneto-acoustic waves is derived by using the WKB theory. An analytic solution
for the time-dependent amplitude of waves is obtained and the method of
characteristics is used to find an approximate analytical solution. Numerical
calculations are applied to the analytically derived solutions to obtain
further insight into the behavior of the MHD waves in a system with variable,
time-dependent background. The results show that there is a strong damping of
MHD waves that can be linked to the widely observed damping of hot coronal loop
oscillations. The damping also appears to be independent of position along the
loop. Studies of MHD wave behaviour in time-dependent background seem to be a
fundamental and very important next step in developing MHD wave theory
applicable to a wide range in solar physics.

investigation of time-dependent current of molecular devices under a step-like

contribute to the time-dependent current. Hence calculation beyond wideband
limit must be carried out for a quantitative analysis of transient dynamics of
molecules devices. Based on the exact non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)
formalism of calculating the transient current in Ref.\onlinecite{Maciejko}, we
develop two approximate schemes going beyond the wideband limit, they are all
suitable for first principles calculation using the NEGF combined with density
functional theory. Benchmark test has been done by comparing with the exact
solution of a single level quantum dot system. Good agreement has been reached
for two approximate schemes. As an application, we calculate the transient
current using the first approximated formula with opposite voltage
$V_L(t)=-V_R(t)$ in two molecular structures: Al-${\rm C}_{5}$-Al and Al-${\rm
C}_{60}$-Al. As illustrated in these examples, our formalism can be easily
implemented for real molecular devices. Importantly, our new formula has
captured the essential physics of dynamical properties of molecular devices and
gives the correct steady state current at $t=0$ and $t\rightarrow \infty$.

matter. This state is characterised by an energy gap for electronic excitations
that makes an insulator electrically inert at low energy. However, for complex
oxides, the very concept of an insulator must be re-examined. Complex oxides
behave differently from conventional insulators such as SiO2, on which the
entire semiconductor industry is based, because of the presence of multiple
defect levels within their band gap. As the semiconductor industry is moving to
such oxides for high-dielectric (high-k) materials, we need to truly understand
the insulating properties of these oxides under various electric field
excitations. Here we report a new class of material called nonlinear insulators
that exhibits a reversible electric-field-induced metal-insulator transition.
We demonstrate this behaviour for an insulating LaAlO3 thin film in a
metal/LaAlO3/Nb-SrTiO3 heterostructure. Reproducible transitions were observed
between a low-resistance metallic state and a high-resistance non-metallic
state when applying suitable voltages. Our experimental results exclude the
possibility that diffusion of the metal electrodes or oxygen vacancies into the
LaAlO3 layer is occurring. Instead, the phenomenon is attributed to the
formation of a quasi-conduction band (QCB) in the defect states of LaAlO3 that
forms a continuum state with the conduction band of the Nb-SrTiO3. Once this
continuum (metallic) state is formed, the state remains stable even when the
voltage bias is turned off. An opposing voltage is required to deplete the
charges from the defect states. Our ability to manipulate and control these
defect states and, thus, the nonlinear insulating properties of complex oxides
will open up a new path to develop novel devices.

individual molecular clouds to be well-resolved and their stellar associations
to be studied in detail. We model stellar radiative feedback with adaptive ray
tracing. A top-heavy initial mass function for the Population III stars is
considered, resulting in a plausible distribution of pair-instability
supernovae and associated metal enrichment. We find that the gas fraction
recovers from 5 percent to nearly the cosmic fraction in halos with merger
histories rich in halos above 10^7 solar masses. A single pair-instability
supernova is sufficient to enrich the host halo to a metallicity floor of
10^{-3} Z_\odot and to transition to Population II star formation. This
provides a natural explanation for the observed floor on damped Lyman alpha
(DLA) systems metallicities reported in the literature, which is of this order.
We find that stellar metallicities do not necessarily trace stellar ages, as
mergers of halos with established stellar populations can create superpositions

important block cipher in common use nowadays. This high assurance in AES is
given by its resistance to ten years of extensive cryptanalysis, that has shown
no weakness, not even any deviation from the statistical behaviour expected
from a random permutation. Only reduced versions of the ciphers have been
broken, but they are not usually implemented. In this paper we build a
distinguishing attack on the AES, exploiting the properties of a novel cipher
embedding. With our attack we give some statistical evidence that the set of
AES-$128$ encryptions acts on the message space in a way significantly
different than that of the set of random permutations acting on the same space.
While we feel that more computational experiments by independent third parties
are needed in order to validate our statistical results, we show that the
non-random behaviour is the same as we would predict using the property of our
embedding. Indeed, the embedding lowers the nonlinearity of the AES rounds and
therefore the AES encryptions tend, on average, to keep low the rank of
low-rank matrices constructed in the large space. Our attack needs $2^{23}$
plaintext-ciphertext pairs and costs the equivalent of $2^{48}$ encryptions.
  We expect our attack to work also for AES-$192$ and AES-$256$, as confirmed
by preliminary experiments.

demonstrate the presence of a very close BBH that has the binary orbit with an

There are at least two important differences between the proposed model-based

model is built up on the actually observed categorical variables and no
reduction (to 0--1 comparisons) of the available information takes place.
Second, the hierarchical structure of the model allows a two-way propagation of
the uncertainty between the parameter estimation step and the matching
procedure so that no plug-in estimates are used and the correct uncertainty is
accounted for both in estimating the population size and in performing the

particular relations and combining them to form the appropriate orthogonal

sampled from a genuinely high-dimensional structure---similar to standard

the data is of the type ""information${}+{}$noise."" In other words, each
observation is the sum of two independent elements: one sampled from a
""low-dimensional"" structure, the signal part of the data, the other being
high-dimensional noise, normalized to not overwhelm but still affect the
signal. We consider two types of noise, spherical and elliptical. In the
spherical setting, we show that the spectral properties of kernel random
matrices can be understood from a new kernel matrix, computed only from the
signal part of the data, but using (in general) a slightly different kernel.
The Gaussian kernel has some special properties in this setting. The elliptical
setting, which is important from a robustness standpoint, is less prone to easy
interpretation.

properties of phase coherent normal metal-superconductor hybrid systems.
Extensive numerical simulations were carried out for quasi-one dimensional and
two dimensional systems in both square lattice (Fermi electron) as well as
honeycomb lattice (Dirac electron). Our results show that when the Fermi energy
is within the superconducting energy gap $\Delta$, the Andreev conductance
fluctuation exhibits a universal value (UCF) which is approximately two times
larger than that in the normal systems. According to the random matrix theory,
the electron-hole degeneracy (ehD) in the Andreev reflections (AR) plays an
important role in classifying UCF. Our results confirm this. We found that in
the diffusive regime there are two UCF plateaus, one corresponds to the
complete electron-hole symmetry (with ehD) class and the other to conventional
electron-hole conversion (ehD broken). In addition, we have studied the Andreev
conductance distribution and found that for the fixed average conductance $,G>$
the Andreev conductance distribution is a universal function that depends only
on the ehD. In the localized regime, our results show that ehD continues to
serve as an indicator for different universal classes. Finally, if normal
transport is present, i.e., Fermi energy is beyond energy gap $\Delta$, the AR
is suppressed drastically in the localized regime by the disorder and the ehD
becomes irrelevant. As a result, the conductance distribution is that same as
that of normal systems.

combining with the tight-binding Hamiltonian, the Nernst and Seebeck
coefficients are obtained. Due to the electron-hole symmetry, the Nernst
coefficient is an even function of the Fermi energy while the Seebeck
coefficient is an odd function regardless of the magnetic field. In the
presence of a strong magnetic field, the Nernst and Seebeck coefficients are
almost independent of the chirality and width of the nanoribbon, and they show
peaks when the Fermi energy crosses the Landau levels. The height of $n$-th
(excluding $n=0$) peak is $[\ln2/|n|]$ for the Nernst effect and is $\ln2/n$
for the Seebeck effect. For the zeroth peak, it is abnormal with height
$[2\ln2]$ for the Nernst effect and the peak disappears for the Seebeck effect.
When the magnetic field is turned off, however, the Nernst effect is absent and
only Seebeck effect exists. In this case, the Seebeck coefficient strongly
depends on the chirality of the nanoribbon. The peaks are equidistant for the
nanoribbons with zigzag edge but are irregularly distributed for the armchair
edge. In particular, for the insulating armchair ribbon, the Seebeck
coefficient can be very large near the Dirac point. When the magnetic field
varies from zero to large values, the differences among the Seebeck
coefficients for different chiral ribbons gradually vanish and the nonzero
value of Nernst coefficient appears first near the Dirac point then gradually
extents to the whole energy region.

during market crashes, implying that firms go bankrupt with larger values of R.
Based on the Zipf analysis, we employ Bayes's theorem and relate the
conditional probability that a bankrupt firm has a ratio R with the conditional
probability of bankruptcy for a firm with a given R value. For 2,737 bankrupt
firms, we demonstrate size dependence in assets change during the bankruptcy
proceedings. Prepetition firm assets and petition firm assets follow Zipf
distributions but with different exponents, meaning that firms with smaller
assets adjust their assets more than firms with larger assets during the
bankruptcy process. We compare bankrupt firms with nonbankrupt firms by
analyzing the assets and liabilities of two large subsets of the US economy:
2,545 Nasdaq members and 1,680 New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) members. We find
that both assets and liabilities follow a Pareto distribution. The finding is
not a trivial consequence of the Zipf scaling relationship of firm size
quantified by employees-although the market capitalization of Nasdaq stocks
follows a Pareto distribution, the same distribution does not describe NYSE
stocks. We propose a coupled Simon model that simultaneously evolves both
assets and debt with the possibility of bankruptcy, and we also consider the
possibility of firm mergers.

effective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition of the star.
To extract information about the p-mode oscillations, we used a technique based
on the envelope autocorrelation function (EACF). From the Zeeman Doppler
imaging observations, we observe a magnetic field of ~5 gauss. From the
spectral analysis, HD 46375 is inferred to be an unevolved K0 type star with
high metallicity [Fe/H]=+0.39. Owing to the relative faintness of the star
(m_hip=8.05), the signal-to-noise ratio is too low to identify individual
modes. However, we measure the p-mode excess power and large separation Delta
nu_0=153.0 +/- 0.7 muHz. We are able do constrain the fundamental parameters of
the star thanks to spectrometric and seismic analyses. We conclude that HD
46375 is similar to a young version of Alpha-CenB. This work is of special
interest because of its combination of exoplanetary science and
asteroseismology, which are the subjects of the current Kepler mission and the

To this end, we use several methods to analyze the properties of volume changes

joint stochastic process that models these cross-correlations. Motivated by the
relationship between $| R|$ and $|\tilde R|$, we estimate the tail exponent
${\tilde\alpha}$ of the probability density function $P(|\tilde R|) \sim
|\tilde R|^{-1 -\tilde\alpha}$ for both the S\&P 500 index as well as the
collection of 1819 constituents of the New York Stock Exchange Composite index

the contact model for the spread of disease. We consider a `space-time'

studying it. The space-time Potts model emerges as a natural generalization of
the quantum Ising model. The basic properties of the phase transitions in these

FK-cluster, and the resulting lower bound on the critical value in $\ZZ$. We
also develop an alternative graphical representation of the quantum Ising
model, called the random-parity representation. This representation is based on
the random-current representation of the classical Ising model, and allows us
to study in much greater detail the phase transition and critical behaviour.
The random-parity representation is used to prove sharpness of the phase
transition in the quantum Ising model, and to establish bounds on some critical
exponents. We address these issues by using the random-parity representation to
establish certain differential inequalities, integration of which give the
results. Finally we explore some consequences and possible extensions of the

diversity exhibited by the Ap stars observed. We suggest that the Ap star
magnetism is not a result of stable configurations, but is the result of an
instability based on strong toroidal magnetic fields buried in the stars. The
highly nonaxisymmetric remainders of the instability are reminiscent of the
diversity of fields seen on Ap stars. The strengths of these remnant magnetic
fields is actually between a few per cent up to considerable fractions of the
internal toroidal field; this means field strengths of the order of kGauss
being compatible with what is observed. The magnetic fields emerge at the
surface rather quickly; rough estimates deliver time-scales of the order of a
few years. Since rotation stabilizes the instability, normal A stars may still
host considerable, invisible toroidal magnetic fields.

exoplanet with a 3.0236 day period. It was observed by the CoRoT satellite for
34 days during the fall of 2008. We attempt to identify at optical wavelengths,
the changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star. We then try to improve
the star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and the
use of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations. The data analysis relies
on the Fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series. We find evidence of
a sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with light
reflected by the planet. Its relative amplitude is Delta Fp/F* = [13.0, 26.8]
ppm, implying an albedo A=[0.16, 0.33] or a dayside visible brightness
temperature Tb ~ [1880,2030] K by assuming a radius R=1.1 R_Jup and an
inclination i=45 deg. Its orbital phase differs from that of the
radial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_RV. However, the tiny planetary
signal is strongly blended by another signal, which we attribute to a telluric
signal with a 1 day period. We show that this signal is suppressed, but not
eliminated, when using the time series for HD 46179 from the same CoRoT run as
a reference. This detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planet
should be confirmable with a longer CoRoT observation of the same field. In any
case, it demonstrates that non-transiting planets can be characterized using
ultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by CoRoT
and Kepler. The combined detection of solar-type oscillations on the same

the jet axis of leading unpolarized or (pseudo)scalar hadrons, namely pions,
produced in the jet fragmentation process. We identify the observable
leading-twist azimuthal asymmetries for the unpolarized and single-polarized
case related to quark and gluon-originated jets. We account for all physically
allowed combinations of the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton
distribution and fragmentation functions, with special attention to the Sivers,
Boer-Mulders, and transversity quark distributions, and to the Collins
fragmentation function for quarks (and to the analogous functions for gluons).
For each of these effects we evaluate, at central and forward rapidities and
for kinematical configurations accessible at BNL-RHIC, the corresponding
potentially maximized asymmetry (for pi+ production), obtained by saturating
natural positivity bounds (and the Soffer bound for transversity) for the
distribution and fragmentation functions involved and summing additively all
partonic contributions. We then estimate, for both neutral and charged pions,
the asymmetries involving TMD functions for which parameterizations are
available. We also study the role of the different mechanisms, and the
corresponding transverse single spin asymmetries, for large-pT inclusive jet
production.

two-dimensional fluid. We examine the dynamics of such colloids when they are
subject to a constant external force, which drives them in a particular
direction over the surface. Such a situation occurs, for example, for colloidal
particles that have settled to the bottom of their container, when the
container is tilted at an angle, so that they `sediment' to the lower edge of
the surface. We focus in particular on the case when there are attractive
forces between the colloids which causes them to phase separate into regions of
high density and low density and we study the influence of this phase
separation on the sedimentation process. We model the colloids as Brownian
particles and use both Brownian dynamics computer simulations and dynamical
density functional theory (DDFT) to obtain the time evolution of the ensemble
average one-body density profiles of the colloids. We consider situations where
the external potential varies only in one direction so that the ensemble
average density profiles vary only in this direction. We solve the DDFT in
one-dimension, by assuming that the density profile only varies in one
direction. However, we also solve the DDFT in two-dimensions, allowing the
fluid density profile to vary in both the $x$- and $y$-directions. We find that
in certain situations the two-dimensional DDFT is clearly superior to its
one-dimensional counterpart when compared with the simulations and we discuss
this issue.

quark-hadron phase transition during the early post bounce phase of
core-collapse supernovae. We construct a quark equation of state, based on the
bag model for strange quark matter. The transition between the hadronic and the
quark phases is constructed applying Gibbs conditions. The resulting
quark-hadron hybrid equations of state are used in core-collapse supernova
simulations, based on general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics and three
flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport in spherical symmetry. The formation of a
mixed phase reduces the adiabatic index, which induces the gravitational
collapse of the central protoneutron star. The collapse halts in the pure quark
phase, where the adiabatic index increases. A strong accretion shock forms,
which propagates towards the protoneutron star surface. Due to the density
decrease of several orders of magnitude, the accretion shock turns into a
dynamic shock with matter outflow. This moment defines the onset of the
explosion in supernova models that allow for a quark-hadron phase transition,
where otherwise no explosions could be obtained. The shock propagation across
the neutrinospheres releases a burst of neutrinos. This serves as a strong
observable identification for the structural reconfiguration of the stellar
core. The ejected matter expands on a short timescale and remains neutron-rich.
These conditions might be suitable for the production of heavy elements via the
r-process. The neutron-rich material is followed by proton-rich neutrino-driven
ejecta in the later cooling phase of the protoneutron star where the vp-process
might occur.

classical oscillator coupled to a molecular junction driven by a finite bias,
including the finite mass effect. We focus on two minimal models for the
molecular junction: Anderson-Holstein (AH) and two-site Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
(SSH) models. As concerns the oscillator dynamics, we are able to recover a
Langevin equation confirming what found by other authors with different
approaches and assessing that quantum effects come from the electronic
subsystem only. Solving numerically the stochastic equation, we study the
position and velocity distribution probabilities of the oscillator and the
electronic transport properties at arbitrary values of electron-oscillator
interaction, gate and bias voltages. The range of validity of the adiabatic
approximation is established in a systematic way by analyzing the behaviour of
the kinetic energy of the oscillator. Due to the dynamical fluctuations, at
intermediate bias voltages, the velocity distributions deviate from a gaussian
shape and the average kinetic energy shows a non monotonic behaviour. In this
same regime of parameters, the dynamical effects favour the conduction far from
electronic resonances where small currents are observed in the infinite mass
approximation. These effects are enhanced in the two-site SSH model due to the
presence of the intermolecular hopping t. Remarkably, for sufficiently large
hopping with respect to tunneling on the molecule, small interaction strengths
and at intermediate bias (non gaussian regime), we point out a correspondence
between the minima of the kinetic energy and the maxima of the dynamical
conductance.
