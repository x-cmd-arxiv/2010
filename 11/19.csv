in the Pleiades, PLZJ23, PLZJ93 and PLZJ100. We determine the effective

photometry we place an upper limit of 1100 K on the effective temperature of
PLZJ100 but lack the data required to determine the value more precisely. These
temperatures are in the T dwarf regime yet the methane colours indicate no
methane is present.We attribute this to youth/low gravity in line with
theoretical expectations. However, we find even less methane is present than
predicted by the models. PLZJ23 and PLZJ93 are also very bright in the [3.6]
micron waveband (PLZJ100 is not measured) compared to field brown dwarfs which
can also be explained by this lack of methane. The definition of the T spectral
class is the appearance of methane absorption, so strictly, via this
definition, PLZJ93 and PLZJ100 cannot be described as T dwarfs. The colours of
these two objects are, however, not compatible with those of L dwarfs. Thus we
have a classification problem and cannot assign these objects a (photometric)
spectral type.

Blue Galaxy NGC 7673 are studied in detail using 3D spectroscopic data taken
with the PPAK IFU at the 3.5-m telescope in CAHA. We derive integrated and
spatially resolved properties such as extinction, star formation rate and
metallicity for this galaxy. Our data show an extinction map with maximum
values located at the position of the main clumps of star formation showing
small spatial variations (E(B-V)_{t}=0.12-0.21 mag). We derive a H\alpha-based
SFR for this galaxy of 6.2 \pm 0.8 M_{\odot}/yr in agreement with the SFR
derived from infrared and radio continuum fluxes. The star formation is located
mainly in clumps A, B, C and F. Different properties measured in clump B makes
this region peculiar. We find the highest H\alpha luminosity with a SFR surface
density of 0.5 M_{\odot}yr^{-1}kpc^{-2} in this clump. In our previous work,
the kinematic analysis for this galaxy shows an asymmetrical ionized gas
velocity field with a kinematic decoupled component located at the position of
clump B. This region shows the absence of strong absorption features and the
presence of a Wolf-Rayet stellar population indicating this is a young burst of
massive stars. Furthermore, we estimate a gas metallicity of
12+log(O/H)=8.20\pm0.15 for the integrated galaxy using the R23 index. The
values derived for the different clumps with this method show small metallicity
variations in this galaxy, with values in the range 8.12 (for clump A) - 8.23
(for clump B) for 12+log(O/H). The analysis of the emission line ratios
discards the presence of any AGN activity or shocks as the ionization source in
this galaxy. Between the possible mechanisms to explain the starburst activity
in this galaxy, our 3D spectroscopic data support the scenario of an on-going
interaction with the possibility for clump B to be the dwarf satellite galaxy.

In both models the ultimate steady flow state is homogeneous at all shear

However, particularly in the SGR case, the transient bands can be extremely

cross-composition. A classical problem L cross-composes into a parameterized
problem Q if an instance of Q with polynomially bounded parameter value can
express the logical OR of a sequence of instances of L. Building on work by
Bodlaender et al. (ICALP 2008) and using a result by Fortnow and Santhanam
(STOC 2008) we show that if an NP-complete problem cross-composes into a
parameterized problem Q then Q does not admit a polynomial kernel unless the
polynomial hierarchy collapses. Our technique generalizes and strengthens the
recent techniques of using OR-composition algorithms and of transferring the
lower bounds via polynomial parameter transformations. We show its
applicability by proving kernelization lower bounds for a number of important
graphs problems with structural (non-standard) parameterizations, e.g.,
Chromatic Number, Clique, and Weighted Feedback Vertex Set do not admit
polynomial kernels with respect to the vertex cover number of the input graphs
unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, contrasting the fact that these
problems are trivially fixed-parameter tractable for this parameter. We have
similar lower bounds for Feedback Vertex Set.

(Susceptible $\to$ Infectious $\to$ Recovered) epidemic on a network of
individuals described by a random intersection graph. Individuals belong to a
random number of cliques, each of random size, and infection can be transmitted
between two individuals if and only if there is a clique they both belong to.
Both the clique sizes and the number of cliques an individual belongs to follow
mixed Poisson distributions. An infinite-type branching process approximation
(with type being given by the length of an individual's infectious period) for
the early stages of an epidemic is developed and made fully rigorous by proving
an associated limit theorem as the population size tends to infinity. This
leads to a threshold parameter $R_*$, so that in a large population an epidemic
with few initial infectives can give rise to a large outbreak if and only if
$R_*>1$. A functional equation for the survival probability of the
approximating infinite-type branching process is determined; if $R_*\le1$, this
equation has no nonzero solution, while if $R_*>1$, it is shown to have
precisely one nonzero solution. A law of large numbers for the size of such a
large outbreak is proved by exploiting a single-type branching process that
approximates the size of the susceptibility set of a typical individual.

past decade enabled the development and simulation of increasingly complex
mathematical models of cancer growth. These models typically involve many free
parameters whose determination is a substantial obstacle to model development.
Direct measurement of biochemical parameters in vivo is often difficult and
sometimes impracticable, while fitting them under data-poor conditions may
result in biologically implausible values.
  Results: We discuss different methodological approaches to estimate
parameters in complex biological models. We make use of the high computational
power of the Blue Gene technology to perform an extensive study of the
parameter space in a model of avascular tumor growth. We explicitly show that
the landscape of the cost function used to optimize the model to the data has a
very rugged surface in parameter space. This cost function has many local
minima with unrealistic solutions, including the global minimum corresponding
to the best fit.
  Conclusions: The case studied in this paper shows one example in which model
parameters that optimally fit the data are not necessarily the best ones from a
biological point of view. To avoid force-fitting a model to a dataset, we
propose that the best model parameters should be found by choosing, among
suboptimal parameters, those that match criteria other than the ones used to
fit the model. We also conclude that the model, data and optimization approach
form a new complex system, and point to the need of a theory that addresses
this problem more generally.

is close to one in LQC, grows and tends to 1 as one approaches the GR limit. We
study the origin of the tension between these results with those by Gibbons and
Turok, and offer an explanation that brings these apparent contradictory

different choices of initial conditions for the computation of probability. The
singularity free scenario of loop quantum cosmology offers a natural choice of

after an outburst event (between 2006 April 16 - 26 UT) and detected
crystalline silicates. The mineralogy of both fragments was dominated by
amorphous carbon and amorphous pyroxene. The grain size distribution (assuming
a Hanner modified power-law) for fragment SW3-[B] has a peak grain radius of
a_p ~ 0.5 micron, and for fragment SW3-[C], a_p ~ 0.3 micron; both values
larger than the peak grain radius of the size distribution for the dust ejected
from ecliptic comet 9P/Tempel 1 during the Deep Impact event (a_p = 0.2 micron.
The silicate-to-carbon ratio and the silicate crystalline mass fraction for the
submicron to micron-size portion of the grain size distribution on the nucleus
of fragment SW3-[B] was 1.341 +0.250 -0.253 and 0.335 +0.089 -0.112,
respectively, while on the nucleus of fragment SW3-[C] was 0.671 +0.076 -0.076
and 0.257 +0.039 -0.043, respectively. The similarity in mineralogy and grain
properties between the two fragments implies that 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 is
homogeneous in composition. The slight differences in grain size distribution
and silicate-to-carbon ratio between the two fragments likely arises because
SW3-[B] was actively fragmenting throughout its passage while the activity in
SW3-[C] was primarily driven by jets. The lack of diverse mineralogy in the
fragments SW3-[B] and SW3-[C] of 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 along with the
relatively larger peak in the coma grain size distribution suggests the parent
body of this comet may have formed in a region of the solar nebula with

localized notch in the gap and a characteristic phase difference across the
notch for all interaction strengths, from BEC to BCS regimes. However, they do
not follow the well-known Josephson-like sinusoidal relationship between
velocity and phase difference except in the far BEC limit: at unitary the
velocity has a nearly linear dependence on phase difference over an extended
range. For fixed phase difference the soliton is of nearly constant depth from
the BEC limit to unitarity and then grows progressively shallower into the BCS
limit, and on the BCS side Friedel oscillations are apparent in both gap
amplitude and phase. The crossover soliton appears fundamentally in the gap; we
show, however, that the density closely follows the gap, and the soliton is
therefore observable. We develop an approximate power law relationship to
express this fact: the density of grey crossover solitons varies as the square
of the gap amplitude in the BEC limit and a power of about 1.5 at unitarity.

dimension greater than or equal to four are studied. Gauge invariant
formulation for such currents and shadow fields is developed. Gauge symmetries
are realized by involving Stueckelberg and auxiliary fields. Gauge invariant
differential constraints for anomalous currents and shadow fields and
realization of global conformal symmetries are obtained. Gauge invariant
two-point vertices for anomalous shadow fields are also obtained. In
Stueckelberg gauge frame, these gauge invariant vertices become the standard
two-point vertices of CFT. Light-cone gauge two-point vertices of the anomalous
shadow fields are derived. AdS/CFT correspondence for anomalous currents and
shadow fields and the respective normalizable and non-normalizable solutions of
massive low-spin AdS fields is studied. The bulk fields are considered in
modified de Donder gauge that leads to decoupled equations of motion. We
demonstrate that leftover on-shell gauge symmetries of bulk massive fields
correspond to gauge symmetries of boundary anomalous currents and shadow
fields, while the modified (Lorentz) de Donder gauge conditions for bulk
massive fields correspond to differential constraints for boundary anomalous

phenomena. Protein conformational functionality is often dominated by
long-range hydro(phobic/philic) interactions which both drive protein
compaction and mediate protein-protein interactions. Superfamily transmembrane
GPCR are the largest family of proteins in the human genome; their amino acid
sequences form the largest data base for protein-membrane interactions. While
there are now structural data on the heptad transmembrane structures of
representatives of several heptad families, here we show that fresh insights
into global and some local chemical trends in GPCR properties can be obtained
accurately from sequences alone, especially by separating the extracellular and
cytoplasmic loops from transmembrane segments. The global mediation of
long-range water-protein interactions occurs in conjunction with modulation of
these interactions by roughened interfaces. Hydropathic roughening profiles are
defined here solely in terms of amino acid sequences, and knowledge of protein
coordinates is not required. Roughening profiles both for GPCR and some simpler
protein families display accurate and transparent connections to protein
functionality.

(antiLambda+antiSigma0+1.1*antiSigma-)/antiproton ratio of 3.5 has been
observed in the mid-rapidity and low transverse momentum region in central
Au+Au collisions at the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 4.9 GeV at the
Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS). This is an order of magnitude larger
than the values in peripheral Au+Au collisions and p+p collisions at the
corresponding energy. By using the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular
Dynamics (UrQMD) transport model, we demonstrate that the observed large ratio
can be explained by strong absorption of antiprotons (~99.9%) and antiLambdas
(~99%) in dense nuclear matter created in central collisions. We find within
the model that the initial antiLambda/antiproton ratio, mainly from string
fragmentation, does not depend on the collision centrality, and is consistent
with that observed in p+p collisions. This suggests that the observed large
(antiLambda+antiSigma0+1.1*antiSigma-)/antiproton ratio at the AGS does not
necessarily imply the formation of the QGP. We further study the excitation
function of the ratio in UrQMD, which may help in the search and study of the
QGP.

accounts for systematically different measurement errors. We find that neutron
stars that have evolved through different evolutionary paths reflect
distinctive signatures through dissimilar distribution peak and mass cutoff
values. Neutron stars in double neutron star and neutron star-white dwarf
systems show consistent respective peaks at 1.35 Msun and 1.50 Msun which
suggest significant mass accretion (Delta m~0.15 Msun) has occurred during the
spin up phase. The width of the mass distribution implied by double neutron
star systems is indicative of a tight initial mass function while the inferred
mass range is significantly wider for neutron stars that have gone through
recycling. We find a mass cutoff at 2 Msun for neutron stars with white dwarf
companions which establishes a firm lower bound for the maximum neutron star
mass. This rules out the majority of strange quark and soft equation of state
models as viable configurations for neutron star matter. The lack of truncation
close to the maximum mass cutoff suggests that the 2 Msun limit is set by
evolutionary constraints rather than nuclear physics or general relativity, and
the existence of rare super-massive neutron stars is possible.

generalized Sasakian manifold which satisfies an additional ""Einstein""

to a space of generalized Sasakian structures is simply the contact volume, and
that its minimization determines the Reeb vector field for such a solution. We
conjecture that this contact volume is equal to the inverse of the trial
central charge whose maximization determines the R-symmetry of any
four-dimensional N=1 superconformal field theory. This variational procedure
allows us to compute the contact volumes for a predicted infinite family of

Their parameter spaces are however rather large and complex, such that pinning
down the actual parameter values from experimental data can depend strongly on
the employed statistical framework and scanning algorithm. In frequentist
parameter estimation, a central requirement for properly constructed confidence
intervals is that they cover true parameter values, preferably at exactly the
stated confidence level when experiments are repeated infinitely many times.
Since most widely-used scanning techniques are optimised for Bayesian
statistics, one needs to assess their abilities in providing correct confidence
intervals in terms of the statistical coverage. Here we investigate this for
the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) when only
constrained by data from direct searches for dark matter. We construct
confidence intervals from one-dimensional profile likelihoods and study the
coverage by generating several pseudo-experiments for a few benchmark sets of
pseudo-true parameters. We use nested sampling to scan the parameter space and
evaluate the coverage for the benchmarks when either flat or logarithmic priors
are imposed on gaugino and scalar mass parameters. The sampling algorithm has
been used in the configuration usually adopted for exploration of the Bayesian
posterior. We observe both under- and over-coverage, which in some cases vary
quite dramatically when benchmarks or priors are modified. We show how most of
the variation can be explained as the impact of explicit priors as well as
sampling effects, where the latter are indirectly imposed by physicality
conditions. For comparison, we also evaluate the coverage for Bayesian credible
intervals, and observe significant under-coverage in those cases.

more realistic since it predicts neutrino oscillations in space. Besides
oscillations among different neutrino flavors, we also study transitions

which will be explored in this thesis. The possibility now exists
experimentally to exploit these high momentum particles to uniquely probe the
unprecedented state of matter produced in heavy ion collisions. At the same
time naive theoretical expectations have been dashed by data.
  The first puzzle we confront is that of the enormous intermediate-pT
azimuthal anisotropy, or v2, of jets observed at RHIC. The second puzzle is the
surprisingly similar suppression of light mesons and nonphotonic electrons,
which precludes perturbative predictions predicated on gluon bremsstrahlung
radiation as the dominant energy loss channel. Near qualitative agreement
results from including collisional energy loss and integrating over the
fluctuating jet pathlengths. Another conjecture for heavy quark energy loss
comes via explicit construction using the AdS/CFT correspondence; the momentum
loss of a hanging dragging string moving through the deconfined plasma leads to
qualitative agreement with heavy quark decay data. We propose a robust test to
experimentally differentiate these two competing ideas: the ratio of charm to
bottom suppression rapidly approaches 1 for pQCD but is independent of momentum
and well below 1 for AdS/CFT. Finally as a warmup problem to calculating the
photon bremsstrahlung associated with jet energy loss we quantify improvements
to the perturbative estimates of the Ter-Mikayelian effect.

evolution of macroscopic systems considered as problem of incomplete
information. Two different MaxEnt approaches are introduced in this work, both
applied to prediction of time evolution for closed Hamiltonian systems. The
first one is based on Liouville equation for the conditional probability
distribution, introduced as a strict microscopic constraint on time evolution
in phase space. The conditional probability distribution is defined for the set
of microstates associated with the set of phase space paths determined by
solutions of Hamilton's equations. The MaxEnt inference algorithm with
Shannon's concept of the conditional information entropy is then applied to
prediction, consistently with this strict microscopic constraint on time
evolution in phase space. The second approach is based on the same concepts,
with a difference that Liouville equation for the conditional probability
distribution is introduced as a macroscopic constraint given by a phase space
average. We consider the incomplete nature of our information about microscopic
dynamics in a rational way that is consistent with Jaynes' formulation of
predictive statistical mechanics. Maximization of the conditional information
entropy subject to this macroscopic constraint leads to a loss of correlation
between the initial phase space paths and final microstates. Information
entropy is the theoretic upper bound on the conditional information entropy,
with the upper bound attained only in case of the complete loss of correlation.
In this alternative approach to prediction of macroscopic time evolution,
maximization of the conditional information entropy is equivalent to the loss
of statistical correlation. In accordance with Jaynes, irreversibility appears
as a consequence of gradual loss of information about possible microstates of
the system.

explore the possibility that such systems are not binaries at all, but actually
coeval, or dynamical formed, triple systems. The tertiary induces Kozai
oscillations in the inner binary, driving it to high eccentricity, and reducing
its gravitational wave (GW) merger timescale. This effect significantly
increases the allowed range of binary period P such that the merger time is
t_merge < t_H. In principle, Chandrasekhar-mass binaries with P ~ 300 days can
merge in < t_H if they contain a prograde solar-mass tertiary at high enough
inclination. For retrograde tertiaries, the maximum P such that t_merge < t_H
is yet larger. In contrast, P < 0.3 days is required in the absence of a
tertiary. I discuss implications of these findings for the production of
transients formed via compact object binary mergers. Based on the statistics of
solar-type binaries, I argue that many such binaries should be in triple
systems affected by the Kozai resonance. If true, expectations for the mHz GW
signal from individual sources, the diffuse background, and the foreground for
GW experiments like LISA are modified. This work motivates future studies of
triples systems of A, B,and O stars, and new types of searches for WD-WD
binaries in triple systems.

mechanisms. Large Nernst effects, a decade ago a topic mainly in vortex
dynamics in superconductors, have recently attracted interest in correlated
systems like cuprate metals and heavy fermion systems. However, it has been
found that these ``giant"" Nernst signals stay within one order of magnitude of
the classical Sondheimer formula for a Fermi liquid. It therefore seems that a
large Nernst effect neither relies on nor is sensitive to strong correlations.
This might, however, be different in some recently studied supposedly
correlated systems like FeSB_2. We do not address these systems specifically,
but take them only as one inspiration for considering a theoretical scenario
where correlations could actually sizably modify the Sondheimer formula. We
point out that an enhanced Nernst signal would follow from the phenomenological
Boltzmann approach introduced by Coleman, Schofield and Tsvelik proposed to
capture electronic correlations by imposing different relaxation times on the
charge conjugation even and odd Majorana components of the electron.

networks present a wide range of applications, from the analysis of dynamical
processes taking place in the network to spectral techniques aiming to rank the
importance of nodes in the network. A common approach to study the relationship
between the structure of a network and its eigenvalues is to use synthetic
random networks in which structural properties of interest, such as degree
distributions, are prescribed. Although very common, synthetic models present
two major flaws: (\emph{i}) These models are only suitable to study a very
limited range of structural properties, and (\emph{ii}) they implicitly induce
structural properties that are not directly controlled and can deceivingly
influence the network eigenvalue spectrum. In this paper, we propose an
alternative approach to overcome these limitations. Our approach is not based
on synthetic models, instead, we use algebraic graph theory and convex
optimization to study how structural properties influence the spectrum of
eigenvalues of the network. Using our approach, we can compute with low
computational overhead global spectral properties of a network from its local
structural properties. We illustrate our approach by studying how structural
properties of online social networks influence their eigenvalue spectra.

absorbing material is located at a different place from the UV absorbing wind,

crises. The persistent recurrence of such economic crises calls for an
understanding of their generic features rather than treating them as singular
events. The global economic system is a highly complex system and can best be
viewed in terms of a network of interacting macroeconomic agents. In this
regard, from the perspective of collective network dynamics, here we explore
how the topology of global macroeconomic network affects the patterns of
spreading of economic crises. Using a simple toy model of crisis spreading, we
demonstrate that an individual country's role in crisis spreading is not only
dependent on its gross macroeconomic capacities, but also on its local and
global connectivity profile in the context of the world economic network. We
find that on one hand clustering of weak links at the regional scale can
significantly aggravate the spread of crises, but on the other hand the current
network structure at the global scale harbors a higher tolerance of extreme
crises compared to more ""globalized"" random networks. These results suggest
that there can be a potential hidden cost in the ongoing globalization movement
towards establishing less-constrained, trans-regional economic links between
countries, by increasing the vulnerability of global economic system to extreme
crises.

play a key role in making decisions whose eventual outcome is impacted by human
choice behavior. In most scenarios, the choice model, which can effectively be
viewed as a distribution over permutations, must be learned from observed data.
The observed data, in turn, may frequently be viewed as (partial, noisy)
information about marginals of this distribution over permutations. As such,
the search for an appropriate choice model boils down to learning a
distribution over permutations that is (near-)consistent with observed
information about this distribution.
  In this work, we pursue a non-parametric approach which seeks to learn a
choice model (i.e. a distribution over permutations) with {\em sparsest}
possible support, and consistent with observed data. We assume that the data
observed consists of noisy information pertaining to the marginals of the
choice model we seek to learn. We establish that {\em any} choice model admits
a `very' sparse approximation in the sense that there exists a choice model
whose support is small relative to the dimension of the observed data and whose
marginals approximately agree with the observed marginal information. We
further show that under, what we dub, `signature' conditions, such a sparse
approximation can be found in a computationally efficiently fashion relative to
a brute force approach. An empirical study using the American Psychological
Association election data-set suggests that our approach manages to unearth
useful structural properties of the underlying choice model using the sparse
approximation found. Our results further suggest that the signature condition
is a potential alternative to the recently popularized Restricted Null Space
condition for efficient recovery of sparse models.

of the trial wavefunction, and assume the Central Limit Theorem to be valid. In
this paper we provide an analysis of random error in estimation and
optimisation that leads naturally to new sampling strategies with improved
computational and statistical properties. A rigorous lower limit to the random
error is derived, and an efficient sampling strategy presented that
significantly increases computational efficiency. In addition the infinite
variance heavy tailed random errors of optimum parameters in conventional
methods are replaced with a Normal random error, strengthening the theoretical
basis of optimisation. The method is applied to a number of first-row systems,
and compared with previously published results.

X-ray emission, associated with its radio lobes and/or host galaxy. After
careful subtraction of the X-ray and non-X-ray background and contaminating
X-ray sources, the X-ray spectrum of the faint emission was reproduced by a sum
of the power-law (PL) and soft thermal components. The soft component was
attributed to the thermal plasma emission from the host galaxy. The photon
index of the PL component, $\Gamma = 1.35_{-0.86}^{+0.56}$$_{-0.10}^{+0.11}$
where the first and second errors represent the statistical and systematic
ones, was found to agree with the synchrotron radio index from the lobes,
$\Gamma_{\rm R} = 1.7$. Thus, the PL component was attributed to the inverse
Compton (IC) X-rays from the synchrotron electrons in the lobes. The X-ray flux
density at 1 keV was derived as $13.6\pm 5.4_{-3.6}^{+4.0}$ nJy with the photon
index fixed at the radio value. The X-ray surface brightness from these lobes
($\sim 0.2$ nJy arcmin$^{-2}$) is lowest among the lobes studied through the IC
X-ray emission. In combination with the synchrotron radio flux density, $7.5
\pm 0.2$ Jy at 327.4 MHz, the electron energy density spatially averaged over
the lobes was evaluated to be the lowest among those radio galaxies, as $u_{\rm
e} = (5.8 \pm 2.3 _{-1.7}^{+1.9}) \times 10^{-14}$ ergs cm$^{-3}$ over the
electron Lorentz factor of $10^{3}$ -- $10^{5}$. The magnetic energy density
was calculated as $u_{\rm m}=(3.1_{-1.0}^{+2.5}$$_{-0.9}^{+1.4}) \times
10^{-14}$ ergs cm$^{-3}$, corresponding to the magnetic field strength of
$0.88_{-0.16}^{+0.31}$$_{-0.14}^{+0.19}$ $\mu$G. These results suggest that the
energetics in the 3C 35 lobes are nearly consistent with equipartition between
the electrons and magnetic fields.

both as steady state shear banding and transiently after a large step strain or
during start up to a steady uniform shear rate. Steady state shear banding is a
hallmark of models with a non-monotonic constitutive relation between total
shear stress and applied shear rate, but transient banding is sometimes seen in
fluids that do not shear band at steady state. We model this behavior using the
diffusive Rolie-Poly model in a Newtonian solvent, whose constitutive behavior
can be monotonic or non-monotonic depending on the degree of convected
constraint release (CCR). We study monotonic constitutive behaviour. Linear
stability analysis of start up to a sufficiently high shear rate shows that
spatial fluctuations are unstable at early times. There is a strong correlation
between this instability and the negative slope of the (time dependent)
constitutive curve. If the time integral of the most unstable eigenvalue is
sufficiently large then the system exhibits transient shear bands that later
vanish in steady state. We show how perturbations, due to fluctuations or the
inhomogeneous stresses, can trigger this instability. This transient behavior
is similar to recent observations in entangled polymer solutions

precisely, an infinite nonlinear slab is illuminated by an incident field which
is the sum of three plane waves of the same frequency, but with different
propagation vectors and amplitudes, in such a way that the resulting incident
field is periodic. Moreover, the height of the slab is of the same order of the
wavelength, and therefore the so-called slowly varying envelope approximation
cannot be used. In our approach we take into account some retroactions of the
scattered fields between them (for instance, we do not use the nondepletion of
the pump beam). As a result, a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential
equations has to be solved. To do this, the finite element method (FEM)
associated with perfectly matched layers is well suited. Nevertheless, when
using the FEM, the sources have to be located in the meshed area, which is of
course impossible when dealing with plane waves. To get round this difficulty,
the real incident field is simulated by a virtual field emitted by an
appropriate antenna located in the meshed domain and lying above the obstacle

parameter d and by a function f* which specifies the short-range dependence
structure of the process. Our setting is semi-parametric since both f* and d
are unknown and d is the only parameter of interest. The memory parameter d is
estimated by regressing the logarithm of the estimated variance of the wavelet
coefficients at different scales. The two estimators of d that we consider are
based on robust estimators of the variance of the wavelet coefficients, namely
the square of the scale estimator proposed by Rousseeuw and Croux (1993) and
the median of the square of the wavelet coefficients. We establish a Central
Limit Theorem for these robust estimators as well as for the estimator of d
based on the classical estimator of the variance proposed by Moulines, Roueff

claims and compare the performance of the different estimators. The properties
of the three estimators are also compared on the Nile River data and the
Internet traffic packet counts data. The theoretical results and the empirical
evidence strongly suggest using the robust estimators as an alternative to
estimate the memory parameter d of Gaussian time series.

planning, query answering is important, and therefore query optimization
techniques for ASP are of great interest. Magic Sets are one of these
techniques, originally defined for Datalog queries (ASP without disjunction and
negation). Dynamic Magic Sets (DMS) are an extension of this technique, which
has been proved to be sound and complete for query answering over ASP programs
with stratified negation.
  A distinguishing feature of DMS is that the optimization can be exploited
also during the nondeterministic phase of ASP engines. In particular, after
some assumptions have been made during the computation, parts of the program
may become irrelevant to a query under these assumptions. This allows for
dynamic pruning of the search space, which may result in exponential
performance gains.
  In this paper, the correctness of DMS is formally established and proved for
brave and cautious reasoning over the class of super-consistent ASP programs
(ASP^{sc} programs). ASP^{sc} programs guarantee consistency (i.e., have answer
sets) when an arbitrary set of facts is added to them. This result generalizes
the applicability of DMS, since the class of ASP^{sc} programs is richer than
ASP programs with stratified negation, and in particular includes all
odd-cycle-free programs. DMS has been implemented as an extension of DLV, and
the effectiveness of DMS for ASP^{sc} programs is empirically confirmed by
experimental results with this system.

possible to accurately retrieve the magnetic field vector in regions with very
low polarization signals (e.g: internetwork), employing the \ion{Fe}{I} line
pair at 6300 {\AA}. We first perform inversions of the Stokes vector observed
with Hinode/SP in the quiet Sun at disk center in order to confirm the
distributions retrieved by other authors. We then carry out several Monte-Carlo
simulations with synthetic data where we show that the observed distribution of
the magnetic field vector can be explained in terms of purely vertical
($\gamma=0\deg$) and weak fields ($\bar{B}<20$ G), that are misinterpreted by
the analysis technique (Stokes inversion code) as being horizontal ($\gamma
\approx 90\deg$) and stronger ($\bar{B} \approx 100$ G), due to the effect of
the photon noise. This casts doubts as to whether previous results, presenting
the distributions for the magnetic field vector peaking at $\gamma=90\deg$ and
$\bar{B}=100$ G, are actually correct. We propose that an accurate
determination of the magnetic field vector can be achieved by decreasing the
photon noise to a point where most of the observed profiles posses Stokes $Q$
or $U$ profiles that are above the noise level. Unfortunately, for noise levels
as low as $2.8\times 10^{-4}$ only 30% of the observed region with Hinode/SP
have strong enough $Q$ or $U$ signals, implying that the magnetic field vector
remains unknown in the rest of the internetwork.

effects on the order parameter space. Indeed, the order parameter field is
replaced by a statistical distribution function that is carried by the fluid
flow. Inspired by Doi's model of colloidal suspensions, the present theory is
derived from a hybrid moment closure for Yang-Mills Vlasov plasmas. This hybrid
formulation is constructed under the assumption that inertial effects dominate
over dissipative phenomena, so that the total energy is conserved. After
presenting the basic geometric properties of the theory, the effect of
Yang-Mills fields is considered and a direct application is presented to
magnetized fluids with quadrupolar order (spin nematic phases). Hybrid models
are also formulated for complex fluids with symmetry breaking. For the special
case of liquid crystals, the moment method can be applied to the hybrid
formulation to study to the dynamics of cubatic phases.

selected sample of DA white dwarfs near the blue edge of the DAV (g-mode)

models. A set of high quality time-series data on nine targets has been
obtained in 3 photometric bands (Sloan u', g', r') using ULTRACAM at the VLT
with a typical time resolution of a few tens of ms. Such high resolution is
required because theory predicts very short periods, of the order of a second,
for the p-modes in white dwarfs. The data have been analyzed using Fourier
transform and correlation analysis methods. Results: P-modes have not been
detected in any of our targets. The upper limits obtained for the pulsation
amplitude, typically less than 0.1%, are the smallest limits reported in the
literature. The Nyquist frequencies are large enough to fully cover the
frequency range of interest for the p-modes. For the brightest target of our
sample, G 185-32, a p-mode oscillation with a relative amplitude of 5x10**(-4)
would have been easily detected, as shown by a simple simulation. For G 185-32
we note an excess of power below ~2 Hz in all the three nights of observation,
which might be due in principle to tens of low-amplitude close modes. However,
neither correlation analysis nor Fourier transform of the amplitude spectrum
show significant results. We also checked the possibility that the p-modes have
a very short lifetime, shorter than the observing runs, by dividing each run in
several subsets and analyzing these subsets independently. The amplitude
spectra show only a few peaks with S/N ratio higher than 4 sigma but the same
peaks are not detected in different subsets, as we would expect, and we do not

descriptor of ordered structures, departing from the definition of three
conditions to be satisfied for a hierarchical structure: {\em order}, {\em
predictability} and {\em pyramidal structure}. According to these principles we
define a hierarchical index taking concepts from graph and information theory.
This estimator allows to quantify the hierarchical character of any system
susceptible to be abstracted in a feedforward causal graph, i.e., a directed
acyclic graph defined in a single connected structure. Our hierarchical index
is a balance between this predictability and pyramidal condition by the
definition of two entropies: one attending the onward flow and other for the
backward reversion. We show how this index allows to identify hierarchical,
anti-hierarchical and non hierarchical structures. Our formalism reveals that
departing from the defined conditions for a hierarchical structure, feedforward
trees and the inverted tree graphs emerge as the only causal structures of
maximal hierarchical and anti-hierarchical systems, respectively. Conversely,
null values of the hierarchical index are attributed to a number of different
configuration networks; from linear chains, due to their lack of pyramid
structure, to full-connected feedforward graphs where the diversity of onward
pathways is canceled by the uncertainty (lack of predictability) when going
backwards. Some illustrative examples are provided for the distinction among
these three types of hierarchical causal graphs.

playing, somehow, the role of a high-pass filter, is then designed in order to
infer the original velocity signal from the perturbed one. The quality of this

directions of progress in the {\sc $c$-Balanced Separator} problem. More
specifically, we propose a family of mathematical programs, that depend upon a
parameter $p > 0$, and is an extension of the uniform version of the SDPs
proposed by Goemans and Linial for this problem. In fact for the case, when
$p=1$, if one can solve this program in polynomial time then simply using the
Goemans-Williamson's randomized rounding algorithm for {\sc Max Cut}
\cite{WG95} will give an $O(1)$-factor approximation algorithm for {\sc
$c$-Balanced Separator} improving the best known approximation factor of
$O(\sqrt{\log n})$ due to Arora, Rao and Vazirani \cite{ARV}. This family of
programs is not convex but one can transform them into so called
\emph{\textbf{concave programs}} in which one optimizes a concave function over
a convex feasible set. It is well known that the optima of such programs lie at
one of the extreme points of the feasible set \cite{TTT85}. Our main
contribution is a combinatorial characterization of some extreme points of the
feasible set of the mathematical program, for $p=1$ case, which to the best of
our knowledge is the first of its kind. We further demonstrate how this
characterization can be used to solve the program in a restricted setting.
Non-convex programs have recently been investigated by Bhaskara and
Vijayaraghvan \cite{BV11} in which they design algorithms for approximating
Matrix $p$-norms although their algorithmic techniques are analytical in

chemically enriched region, such as a superbubble, and the outward-decreasing
abundance naturally leads to the hard spectrum of CR helium if CRs escape from
the supernova remnant (SNR) shock in an energy-dependent way. We provide a
simple analytical spectrum that also fits well the hardening (2) because of the
decreasing Mach number in the hot superbubble with ~ 10^6 K. Our model predicts

of the standard finite difference methods is proven for the formulation in the
linear regime around flat space, a special case of which is the numerical
stability of BSSN. Numerical evolutions are presented and compared with a
standard BSSN implementation. We find that a significant portion of the
parameter space leads to stable evolutions and that standard BSSN is located
near the edge of the stability region. Non-standard parameter choices typically
result in smoother behaviour of the evolution variables close to the puncture
and thus hold promise for improved accuracy in, e.g., long-term BH binary
inspirals, and for overcoming (numerical) stability problems still encountered
in some types of black-hole simulations, e.g., in $D \ge 6$ dimensions.

important material sodium niobate as a function of temperature on heating over
300-1075 K. Our high resolution powder neutron diffraction data show variety of
structural phase transitions ranging from non-polar antiferrodistortive to
ferroelectric and antiferroelectric in nature. Discontinuous jump in lattice
parameters is found only at 633 K that indicates that the transition of
orthorhombic antiferroelectric P (space group Pbcm) to R (space group Pbnm)
phase is first order in nature, while other successive phase transitions are of
second order. New superlattice reflections appear at 680 K (R phase) and 770 K
(S phase) that could be indexed using an intermediate long-period modulated
orthorhombic structure whose lattice parameter along <001> direction is 3 and 6
times that of the CaTiO3-like Pbnm structure respectively. The correlation of
superlattice reflections with the phonon instability is discussed. The critical
exponent ({\beta}) for the second order tetragonal to cubic phase transition at
950 K, corresponds to a value {\beta}$\approx 1/3$, as obtained from the
temperature variation of order parameters (tilt angle and intensity of
superlattice reflections). It is argued that this exponent is due to a second
order phase transition close to a tricritical point. Based on our detailed
temperature dependent neutron diffraction studies, the phase diagram of sodium
niobate is presented that resolves existing ambiguities in the literature.

Tauri star on the disk chemical composition. For the first time we utilize a
comprehensive model of dust evolution which includes growth, fragmentation and
sedimentation. Specific attention is paid to the influence of grain evolution
on the penetration of the UV field in the disk. A chemical model that includes
a comprehensive set of gas phase and grain surface chemical reactions is used
to simulate the chemical structure of the disk. The main effect of the grain
evolution on the disk chemical composition comes from sedimentation, and, to a
lesser degree, from the reduction of the total grain surface area. The net
effect of grain growth is suppressed by the fragmentation process which
maintains a population of small grains, dominating the total grain surface
area. We consider three models of dust properties. In model GS both growth and
sedimentation are taken into account. In models A5 and A4 all grains are
assumed to have the same size (10(-5) cm and 10(-4) cm, respectively) with
constant gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100. Like in previous studies, the
""three-layer"" pattern (midplane, molecular layer, hot atmosphere) in the disk
chemical structure is preserved in all models, but shifted closer to the
midplane in models with increased grain size (GS and A4). Unlike other similar
studies, we find that in models GS and A4 column densities of most gas-phase
species are enhanced by 1-3 orders of magnitude relative to those in a model
with pristine dust (A5), while column densities of their surface counterparts
are decreased. We show that column densities of certain species, like C2H,
HC(2n+1)N (n=0-3), H2O and some other molecules, as well as the C2H2/HCN
abundance ratio which are accessible with Herschel and ALMA can be used as

100 km. The protons come from just above the local horizon, and move along the
magnetic field in the solar wind reference frame. We compared the observed
proton flux with the predictions from analytical models of an electrostatic
plasma expansion into a vacuum. The observed velocity was higher than the
velocity predicted by analytical models by a factor of 2 to 3. The simple
analytical models cannot explain the observed ion dynamics along the magnetic
field in the vicinity of the Moon.

Bose-Einstein condensate to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BEC-BCS) crossover. We
derive an exact equation relating the phase jump across the soliton to its
energy, and hence obtain an expression for the soliton period. Our analytic
approach is supported by simulations of the time-dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes
equations, which show that the period dramatically increases as the soliton
becomes shallower on the BCS side of the resonance. Finally, we propose an
experimental protocol to test our predictions.

tomography, we consider how to incorporate the imperfections and restrictions
of available measurements directly into the quantification of entanglement.
Exploiting the idea that the recently introduced semiquantum nonlocal games as
the gauge of the amount of entanglement in a state, we define an effective
entanglement functional giving us effective entanglement when the measurement
operators one has at their disposal are restricted by either fundamental
considerations, such as superselection rules, or practical inability to conduct
precise measurements. We show that effective entanglement is always reduced by
restricting measurements. We define effective entanglement as the least amount
of entanglement necessary to play all semiquantum nonlocal games at least as
well with unrestricted measurements as with the more entangled original state
and restricted measurements. We show that simple linear relationship between
effective and conventional G-concurrence, generalization of concurrence, can be
obtained when completely positive maps are used to describe measurement
restrictions. We consider how typical measurement errors like photon loss and
phase damping degrade effective entanglement in quantum optical experiments, as
well as the impact of mass superselection rules on entanglement of massive
indistinguishable particles. The flexibility of the effective entanglement
formalism allows this single-particle entanglement to be calculated in the
presence of a local Bose Einstein condensate reference frame with varying phase
uncertainty, thereby interpolating between the complete breaking or strict
application of the super-selection rule.

  confinement",,,"10.1103/PhysRevB.83.214509",,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  It is well-known that the formation of discrete electron levels strongly
influences the pairing in metallic nanograins. Here we focus on another effect
of quantum confinement in superconducting grains that was not studied
previously, i.e., spatially nonuniform pairing. This effect is very significant
when single-electron levels form bunches and/or a kind of shell structure: in
highly symmetric grains the order parameter can exhibit variations with
position by an order of magnitude. Nonuniform pairing is closely related to a
quantum-confinement induced modification of the pairing-interaction matrix
elements and size-dependent pinning of the chemical potential to groups of
degenerate or nearly degenerate levels. For illustration we consider spherical
metallic nanograins. We show that the relevant matrix elements are as a rule
enhanced in the presence of quantum confinement, which favors spatial
variations of the order parameter, compensating the corresponding energy cost.
The size-dependent pinning of the chemical potential further increases the
spatial variation of the pair condensate. The role of nonuniform pairing is
smaller in less symmetric confining geometries and/or in the presence of
disorder. However, it always remains of importance when the energy spacing
between discrete electron levels $\delta$ is approaching the scale of the bulk
gap $\Delta_B$, i.e., $\delta > 0.1$-$0.2\,\Delta_B$.

and demand and use the models to determine how the trip length distribution is
affected by the relative shortage or excess of supply, the spatial clustering
of supply and demand, and the degree of attraction or repulsion between supply
and demand at different spatial scales. The models have a multiplicative
structure and in certain cases possess scale invariance properties. Using
detailed population data in metropolitan US regions validates the demand model.
The trip length distribution, evaluated under destination choice models of the
intervening opportunities type, has quasi-analytic form.We take advantage of
this feature to study the sensitivity of the trip length distribution to
parameters of the demand, supply and destination choice models. We find that
trip length is affected in important but different ways by the spatial density
of potential destinations, the dependence among their attractiveness levels,
and the correlation between supply and demand at different spatial scales.
