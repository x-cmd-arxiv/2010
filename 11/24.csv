slightly generalize the formalism introduced by \cite{DUD03} to cover a large

bounded by the minimum of a Hoeffding-type bound and a Vapnik-type bounds, and
thus is smaller than 1 even for small learning set. Finally, we give a simple

non-Fermi- liquid behavior which is mainly driven by single-ion effects. The
substitution of Ni by Cu causes a reduction of both, the RKKY coupling and
Kondo interaction, coming along with a dramatic change of the crystal field
(CF) splitting. Thereby a quasi-quartet ground state observed in CeNi9Ge4
reduces to a two-fold degenerate one in CeNi8CuGe4. This leads to a
modiffcation of the effective spin degeneracy of the Kondo lattice ground state
and to the appearance of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. To obtain a better
understanding of consequences resulting from a reduction of the effective spin
degeneracy, we stepwise replaced Ni by Co. Thereby an increase of the Kondo and
RKKY interactions through the reduction of the effective d-electron count is
expected. Accordingly, a paramagnetic Fermi liquid ground state should arise.
Our experimental studies, however, reveal AFM order already for small Co
concentrations, which becomes even more pronounced with increasing Co content
x. Thereby the modiffcation of the effective spin degeneracy seems to play a
crucial role in this system.

show that $G$ has a \emph{non-linear} faithful action on a polynomial ring $U$
of dimension $n=\mathrm{log}_p(|G|)$ such that the invariant ring $U^G$ is also
polynomial. This contrasts with the case of \emph{linear and graded} group
actions with polynomial rings of invariants, where the classical theorem of
Chevalley-Shephard-Todd and Serre requires $G$ to be generated by
pseudo-reflections.
  Our result is part of a general theory of ""trace surjective $G$-algebras"",
which, in the case of $p$-groups, coincide with the Galois ring-extensions in
the sense of \cite{chr}. We consider the \emph{dehomogenized symmetric algebra}
$D_k$, a polynomial ring with non-linear $G$-action, containing $U$ as a
retract and we show that $D_k^G$ is a polynomial ring. Thus $U$ turns out to be
\emph{universal} in the sense that every trace surjective $G$-algebra can be
constructed from $U$ by ""forming quotients and extending invariants"". As a
consequence we obtain a general structure theorem for Galois-extensions with
given $p$-group as Galois group and any prescribed commutative $k$-algebra $R$
as invariant ring. This is a generalization of the Artin-Schreier-Witt theory

measurements for 60 objects per field using a single, custom-built instrument
that is fiber fed from the SDSS 2.5-m telescope. From our 20 radial velocity
measurements spread over a ~370 d time baseline, we derive a Keplerian orbital
fit with semi-amplitude K=2.533+/-0.025 km/s, period P=5.8953+/-0.0004 d, and
eccentricity consistent with circular. Independent follow-up radial velocity
data confirm the orbit. Adopting a mass of 1.37+/-0.11 M_Sun for the slightly
evolved F9 host star, we infer that the companion has a minimum mass of
28.0+/-1.5 M_Jup, a semimajor axis 0.071+/-0.002 AU assuming an edge-on orbit,
and is probably tidally synchronized. We find no evidence for coherent
instrinsic variability of the host star at the period of the companion at
levels greater than a few millimagnitudes. The companion has an a priori
transit probability of ~14%. Although we find no evidence for transits, we
cannot definitively rule them out for companion radii ~<1 R_Jup.

exponent of the system, this remains a challenging task for continuous systems,
especially if only short time series are available (e.g., in case of
experimental data). In this work, we demonstrate that nonlinear measures based
on recurrence plots obtained from such trajectories provide a practicable
alternative for numerically detecting shrimps. Traditional diagonal line-based
measures of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) as well as measures from
complex network theory are shown to allow an excellent classification of
periodic and chaotic behavior in parameter space. Using the well-studied
R\""ossler system as a benchmark example, we find that the average path length

particularly powerful discriminatory statistics for the identification of

In the absence of the
surface tension effect at the air-fluid interface, the long time behavior of a
free surface with small amplitude has been an intriguing question since the
work of Beale \cite{beale_1}. In this monograph, we develop a new mathematical
framework to resolve this question. If the free interface is horizontally
infinite, we establish that it decays to a flat surface at an algebraic rate.
On the other hand, if the free interface is periodic, we establish that it
decays at an almost exponential rate, i.e. at an arbitrarily fast algebraic
rate determined by the smallness of the data. Our framework contains several
novel techniques, which include: (1) a local well-posedness theory of the
Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of a moving boundary; (2) a two-tier
energy method that couples the boundedness of high-order energy to the decay of
low-order energy, the latter of which is necessary to balance out the growth of
the highest derivatives of the free interface; (3) control of both negative and
positive Sobolev norms, which enhances interpolation estimates and allows for
the decay of infinite surface waves; (4) a localization procedure that is
compatible with the energy method and allows for curved lower surface geometry
in the periodic case. Our decay results lead to the construction of
global-in-time solutions to the surface wave problem.

the process of ionization. In the interstellar medium atoms heavier then
hydrogen which start the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) are never fully
ionized at the moment of injection. We will show that electrons in the atomic
shells are stripped during the acceleration process, when the atoms already
move relativistically. For typical environment around SNRs the dominant
ionization process is the photo-ionization due to the background galactic
radiation. The ionization has two interesting consequences. First, because the
total photo-ionization time is comparable to the beginning of the Sedov-Taylor
phase, the maximum energy which ions can achieve is smaller than the standard
result of the DSA, which predict $E_{\max}\propto Z_N$. As a consequence the
structure of the CR spectrum in the {\it knee} region can be affected. The
second consequence is that electrons are stripped from atoms when they already
move relativistically hence they can start the DSA without any pre-acceleration
mechanism. We use the linear quasi-stationary approach to compute the spectrum
of ions and electrons accelerated after being stripped. We show that the number
of these secondary electrons is enough to account for the synchrotron radiation
observed from young SNRs, if the amplification of the magnetic field occurs.

pairing symmetry of agents $(i,j)\Leftrightarrow(j,i)$. The results demonstrate
that a ""chaotic gas-like model"" can reproduce the Exponential and Power law
distributions observed in real economies. Moreover, it controls the transition
between them. This may give some insight of the micro-level causes that
originate unfair distributions of money in a global society. Ultimately, the
chaotic model makes obvious the inherent instability of asymmetric scenarios,
where sinks of wealth appear and doom the market to extreme inequality.

study the thermodynamics and phase structure of the same in a grand canonical

canonical ensemble boundary potential is fixed instead of the charge as in

here. In the grand canonical ensemble there is an analog of Hawking-Page

diffraction of the scattered light. In the linear convective regime we find
that diffractive effects on SRS from a wide speckled laser beam tend to
increase the SRS threshold with increase of density, so long as the interaction

the resulting intermediate excited states allowing for the creation of high

consequences of this excitation mechanism are demonstrated through simulations
of recent experiments in argon clusters interacting with XUV radiation, in

with our hypothesis that XUV-cluster interactions provide a unique window into
the role of excited atomic states due to the relative lack of photoionization

holes (BH) to study the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a cold
dark matter universe. The model predicts the BH mass, spin and mass accretion
history. BH mass grows via accretion triggered by discs becoming dynamically
unstable or galaxy mergers (called the starburst mode) and accretion from
quasi-hydrostatic hot gas haloes (called the hot-halo mode). By taking into
account AGN obscuration, we obtain a very good fit to the observed luminosity
functions (LF) of AGN (optical, soft and hard X-ray, and bolometric) for a wide
range of redshifts (0<z<6). The model predicts a hierarchical build up of BH
mass, with the typical mass of actively growing BHs increasing with decreasing
redshift. Remarkably, despite this, we find downsizing in the AGN population,
in terms of the differential growth with redshift of the space density of faint
and bright AGN. This arises naturally from the interplay between the starburst
and hot-halo accretion modes. The faint end of the LF is dominated by massive
BHs experiencing quiescent accretion via a thick disc, primarily during the
hot-halo mode. The bright end of the LF, on the other hand, is dominated by AGN
which host BHs accreting close to or in excess of the Eddington limit during
the starburst mode. The model predicts that the comoving space density of AGN
peaks at z~3, similar to the star formation history. However, when taking into
account obscuration, the space density of faint AGN peaks at lower redshift
(z<2) than that of bright AGN (z~2-3). This implies that the cosmic evolution
of AGN is shaped in part by obscuration.

strongly on host luminosity. Bright primaries (M_r<-21.5) host on average ~6
satellites with M_r<-14.5, while primaries with -21.5<M_r<-20.5 have less than
1 satellite per host. We provide Schechter function fits to the luminosity
distributions of satellite galaxies with faint-end slopes -1.3+/-0.2. This
shows that satellites of bright primaries lack an excess population of faint
objects, in agreement with the results in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies.

model we developed earlier that includes ionization via collisional excitation
as an intermediate step. We find that the dynamics of these irradiated clusters
is dominated by collisions. Larger clusters are more highly collisional,
produce higher charge states, and do so more rapidly than smaller clusters.
Higher charge states produced via collisions are found to reduce the overall
photon absorption, since charge states of Ar$^{2+}$ and higher are no longer
photo-accessible. We call this mechanism \textit{collisionally reduced
photoabsorption}, and it decreases the effective cluster photoabsorption
cross-section by more than 30% for Ar$_{55}$ and 45% Ar$_{2057}$. compared to
gas targets with the same number of atoms. An investigation of the shell
structure soon after the laser interaction shows an almost uniformly charged
core with a modestly charged outer shell which evolves to a highly charged
outer shell through collisions. This leads to the explosion of the outer
positive shell and a slow expansion of the core, as was observed in mixed
clusters at shorter wavelength [1]. The time evolution of the electron kinetic
energy distribution begins as a (mostly) Maxwellian distribution. Larger
clusters initially have higher temperature, but are overtaken by smaller
temperature after the laser pulse. The electron velocity distribution of large
clusters quickly become isotropic while smaller clusters retain the inherent
anisotropy created by photoionization.Lastly, the total electron kinetic energy
distribution is integrated over the spacial profile of the laser and the
log-normal distribution of cluster size for comparison with a recent experiment
[2], and good agreement is found.

feedback from multiple supernovae occurring in an OB association. Yet most
extragalactic HI holes have neither a demonstrated expansion velocity, nor an
identified OB association inside them. In this work, we report on the discovery
of an unbroken expanding HI supershell in the nearby spiral galaxy M101, with
an UV emitting OB association inside it. We measure its size (500 pc) and
expansion velocity (20 km/s) by identifying both its approaching and receding
components in the position-velocity space, using 21 cm emission spectroscopy.
This provides us with an ideal system to test the theory of supershells driven
by the mechanical feedback from multiple supernovae. The UV emission of the
cluster inside the supershell is compared with simulated spectral energy
distribution of synthetic clusters of the appropriate age (~15 Myr). The
observed UV flux is found to be consistent with an association of the
appropriate mass (~10^5 Solar Mass) and age required by the energy budget of
the supershell. Properties of this supershell and another previously reported

uniquely favorable due to its superior electrostatic control, reduced carrier
thermalization rate, and beneficial quantum confinement effects that reduce the
off-state leakage below the thermionic limit. Because of higher source
injection compared to staggered-gap and homojunction geometries, BG-TFET
delivers superior performance that is comparable to MOSFET's. BG-TFET even

protocol is a basic voting scheme which allows voters to interact in order to
compute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional in the sense that
regardless of the behavior of the dishonest participants nothing can be learned

Unfortunately, a single dishonest participant can make the protocol abort, in
which case the dishonest participants can nevertheless learn the outcome of the
tally. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which improves the
communication complexity by limiting interaction to be only between voters and
authorities and among the authorities themselves; the simultaneous broadcast is
also limited to the authorities. In the second protocol, as long as a single
authority is honest, the privacy is unconditional, however, a single corrupt
authority or a single corrupt voter can cause the protocol to abort. Our final
protocol provides a safeguard against corrupt voters by enabling a verification
technique to allow the authorities to revoke incorrect votes without aborting

metallic environment produces a honeycomb sheet with in-plane oscillating
long-ranged interactions. We find the ground state of the interacting system in
a variational mean-field method and show that the Fermi wave vector, kF, of the
metal determines which phase occurs in the honeycomb lattice sheet. This is
analogous to the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism in which the

Tuning kF and the interaction strength may lead to a variety of ordered phases,
including a topological insulator and anomalous quantum-hall states with

either to kinematics, such as biconical outflows and/or disk rotation of the

of two distinct NLRs in a merging pair of AGNs. Here we report follow-up near
infrared (NIR) imaging and optical slit spectroscopy of 31 double-peaked [OIII]
type 2 AGNs drawn from the SDSS parent sample presented in Liu et al (2010).
These data reveal a mixture of origins for the double-peaked feature. Roughly
10% of our objects are best explained by binary AGNs at (projected) kpc-scale
separations, where two stellar components with spatially coincident NLRs are
seen. ~ 50% of our objects have [OIII] emission offset by a few kpc,
corresponding to the two velocity components seen in the SDSS spectra, but
there are no corresponding double stellar components seen in the NIR imaging.
For those objects with sufficiently high quality slit spectra, we see velocity
and/or velocity dispersion gradients in [OIII] emission, suggestive of the
kinematic signatures of a single NLR. The remaining ~40% of our objects are
ambiguous, and will need higher spatial resolution observations to distinguish
between the two scenarios. Our observations therefore favor the kinematics
scenario with a single AGN for the majority of these double-peaked [OIII] type
2 AGNs. We emphasize the importance of combining imaging and slit spectroscopy
in identifying kpc binary AGNs, i.e., in no cases does one of these alone allow
an unambiguous identification. We estimate that ~ 0.5-2.5% of the z<0.3 type 2

current main two approaches to parton determination (Hessian and Monte Carlo)
and their use in conjunction with different kinds of parton parametrization. We
summarize the way different physical processes can be used to constrain

the initial geometric triangularity at a fixed impact-parameter and unique to
the structure of jet-induced Mach cone and expanding hot spots dragged by

interference of fermions in the framework of General Nonlocality (GN) [J. Math.
Phys. 49, 033513 (2008)] by studying the self-(inter)action of matter wave.
From the metric of the GN, we derive a special formalism to interpret the
interference contrast when the self-action is perturbative. According to the
formalism, the characteristic of interference pattern is in agreement with
experiment qualitatively. As examples, we apply the formalism to the cases
governed by Schr\""odinger current and Dirac current respectively, both of which
are relevant to topology. The gap between these two cases corresponds to the
fermion magnetic moment, which is possible to test in the near future. In
addition, a general interference formalism for both perturbative and
non-perturbative self-actions is presented. By analyzing the general formalism
we predict that in the nonperturbative limit there is no interference at all.
And by comparison with the special formalism of Schr\""odinger current, the
coupling strength of self-action in the limit is found to be $\infty$. In the
perturbative case, the interference from self-action turns out to be the same
as that from standard approach of quantum theory. Then comparing the
corresponding coefficients quantitatively we conclude that the coupling
strength of self-action in this case falls in the interval $[0,1]$.

480 days of Fermi operation. We find that the average LAT gamma-ray spectrum of
Mrk 501 can be well described by a single power-law function with a photon
index of 1.78 +/- 0.03. While we observe relatively mild flux variations with
the Fermi-LAT (within less than a factor of 2), we detect remarkable spectral
variability where the hardest observed spectral index within the LAT energy
range is 1.52 +/- 0.14, and the softest one is 2.51 +/- 0.20. These unexpected
spectral changes do not correlate with the measured flux variations above
0.3GeV. In this paper, we also present the first results from the
4.5-month-long multifrequency campaign (2009 March 15 - August 1) on Mrk 501,
which included the VLBA, Swift, RXTE, MAGIC and VERITAS, the F-GAMMA,
GASP-WEBT, and other collaborations and instruments which provided excellent
temporal and energy coverage of the source throughout the entire campaign. The
average spectral energy distribution of Mrk 501 is well described by the
standard one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. In the framework of this
model, we find that the dominant emission region is characterized by a size <~
0.1 pc (comparable within a factor of few to the size of the partially-resolved
VLBA core at 15-43 GHz), and that the total jet power (~10^{44} erg s^{-1})
constitutes only a small fraction (~10^{-3}) of the Eddington luminosity. The
energy distribution of the freshly-accelerated radiating electrons required to
fit the time-averaged data has a broken power-law form in the energy range
0.3GeV-10TeV, with spectral indices 2.2 and 2.7 below and above the break
energy of 20GeV. We argue that such a form is consistent with a scenario in
which the bulk of the energy dissipation within the dominant emission zone of
Mrk 501 is due to relativistic, proton-mediated shocks.

perturbative SU(3) symmetry breaking is also analyzed by including all relevant

with other determinations in the context of conventional heavy baryon chiral
perturbation theory for three flavors of light quarks and at the physical value

defined on the partitions of the underlying set of a finite metric space. In
this paper, we construct a framework for studying what happens when we instead
impose various structural conditions on the clustering schemes, under the
general heading of functoriality. Functoriality refers to the idea that one
should be able to compare the results of clustering algorithms as one varies
the data set, for example by adding points or by applying functions to it. We
show that within this framework, one can prove a theorems analogous to one of
J. Kleinberg, in which for example one obtains an existence and uniqueness
theorem instead of a non-existence result.
  We obtain a full classification of all clustering schemes satisfying a
condition we refer to as excisiveness. The classification can be changed by
varying the notion of maps of finite metric spaces. The conditions occur
naturally when one considers clustering as the statistical version of the
geometric notion of connected components. By varying the degree of
functoriality that one requires from the schemes it is possible to construct
richer families of clustering schemes that exhibit sensitivity to density.

receiver and an adversarial wiretapper, each equipped with multiple antennas.
In a departure from existing work, the wiretapper possesses a novel capability
to act either as a passive eavesdropper or as an active jammer, under a
half-duplex constraint. The transmitter therefore faces a choice between
allocating all of its power for data, or broadcasting artificial interference
along with the information signal in an attempt to jam the eavesdropper
(assuming its instantaneous channel state is unknown). To examine the resulting
trade-offs for the legitimate transmitter and the adversary, we model their
interactions as a two-person zero-sum game with the ergodic MIMO secrecy rate
as the payoff function. We first examine conditions for the existence of
pure-strategy Nash equilibria (NE) and the structure of mixed-strategy NE for
the strategic form of the game.We then derive equilibrium strategies for the
extensive form of the game where players move sequentially under scenarios of
perfect and imperfect information. Finally, numerical simulations are presented
to examine the equilibrium outcomes of the various scenarios considered.

signature generally arises from pair production of heavy charged particles
which each decay into a lepton and a weakly interacting stable particle. Here
this class of processes is analyzed with minimal model assumptions by
considering all possible combinations of spin 0, 1/2 or 1, and of weak
iso-singlets, -doublets or -triplets for the new particles. Adding to existing
work on mass and spin measurements, two new variables for spin determination
and an asymmetry for the determination of the couplings of the new particles
are introduced. It is shown that these observables allow one to independently
determine the spin and the couplings of the new particles, except for a few
cases that turn out to be indistinguishable at the LHC. These findings are
corroborated by results of an alternative analysis strategy based on an
automated likelihood test.

object that is to be coded and stored over a set of storage nodes; it is
allowed to store any amount of coded data in each node, as long as the total

subsequently attempts to recover the original data object by accessing only the

successful recovery can be achieved whenever the total amount of data accessed

optimal storage allocation that maximizes the probability of successful

securely obtain an upper-bound on the distance to another entity, the prover.
Thus far, DB was considered mostly in the context of a single prover and a
single verifier. There has been no substantial prior work on secure DB in group
settings, where a set of provers interact with a set of verifiers. The need for
group distance bounding (GDB) is motivated by many practical scenarios,
including: group device pairing, location-based access control and secure
distributed localization. GDB is also useful in mission-critical networks and
automotive computer systems. This paper addresses, for the first time, GDB
protocols by utilizing the new passive DB primitive and the novel mutual
multi-party GDB protocol. We show how they can be used to construct secure and
efficient GDB protocols for various settings. We analyze security and

truly continuous atom laser is to outcouple atoms from a partially condensed
Bose gas, whilst continuously reloading the system with non-condensed thermal
atoms and performing evaporative cooling. Here we use quantum kinetic theory to
model this system and estimate feasible limits for the operation of such a
scheme. For sufficiently high temperatures, the figure of merit for the source
is shown to be the phase-space flux. The dominant process limiting the usage of
sources with low phase-space flux is the three-body loss of the condensed gas.
We conclude that certain double-magneto-optical trap (MOT) sources may produce
substantial mean condensate numbers through continuous evaporation, and provide
an atom laser source with a narrow linewidth and reasonable flux.

that electrons do in the long wavelength limit. Therefore we can use sound
attenuation to measure the spinon mass and lifetime. Furthermore, transverse
ultrasonic attenuation is a direct probe of the onset of pairing because the
Meissner effect of the gauge field causes a ""rapid fall"" of the attenuation at

programming and stochastic orders in a partially observed Markov decision
process (POMDP) framework. A stochastic gradient algorithm is presented to
estimate the optimal linear approximation to this threshold curve. We
illustrate these results by first considering quickest time detection with
phase-type distributed change time and a variance stopping penalty. Then it is
proved that the threshold switching curve also arises in several other Bayesian
decision problems such as quickest transient detection, exponential delay
(risk-sensitive) penalties, stopping time problems in social learning, and
multi-agent scheduling in a changing world. Using Blackwell dominance, it is
shown that for dynamic decision making problems, the optimal decision policy is
lower bounded by a myopic policy. Finally, it is shown how the achievable cost
of the optimal decision policy varies with change time distribution by imposing
a partial order on transition matrices.

the top-15 US institutions and there the NOVA staff performs in these respects
as good or almost as good as that of American top institutes. From a citation
analysis through the use of ADS we conclude that the impact ratio of Dutch
astronomical publications is rising which is opposite to what is reported by
NOWT. This difference is most likely caused by a better separation of astronomy
and physics in ADS than in World of Knowledge. ADS probably finds more

z_abs=2.58 DLA on the line-of-sight to the z=3.07 quasar SDSS
J091826.16+163609.0. The galaxy counterpart of the DLA is detected in the OIII
5007 and OII 3726,3729 emission lines redshifted into the NIR at an impact
parameter of 16 kpc. Ly-alpha emission is not detected. The upper limit implies
that Ly-alpha emission from this galaxy is suppressed by more than an order of
magnitude. The DLA is amongst the most metal-rich DLAs studied so far at
comparable redshifts. We find evidence for substantial depletion of refractory
elements onto dust grains. Fitting the main metal line component of the DLA,
which is located at z_abs=2.5832 and accounts for at least 85% of the total
column density of low-ionisation species, we measure metal abundances from
ZnII, SII, SiII, CrII, MnII, FeII and NiII of -0.12, -0.26, -0.46, -0.88,
-0.92, -1.03 and -0.78, respectively. In addition, we detect absorption in the
Lyman and Werner bands of hydrogen, which represents the first detection of H_2
molecules with X-shooter. The background quasar Q0918+1636 is amongst the
reddest QSOs at redshifts 3.02<z<3.12 from the SDSS catalogue. Its UV to NIR
spectrum is well fitted by a composite QSO spectrum reddened by SMC/LMC-like
extinction curves at z_abs=2.58 with a significant amount of extinction given
by A_V = 0.2 mag. This supports previous claims that there may be more
metal-rich DLAs missing from current samples due to dust reddening of the
background QSOs. The fact that there is evidence for dust both in the central
emitting regions of the galaxy (as evidenced by the lack of Ly-alpha emission)

which is thought to be the final epoch of the cosmic reionization. In a
$\approx530$ arcmin$^2$ deep image of the SSA22 field taken through a
narrowband filter NB912 installed in the Subaru/Suprime-Cam, we have found only
14 LAE candidates with $L_{\rm Ly\alpha}\ga3\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Even
applying the same colour selection criteria, the number density of the LAE
candidates is a factor of 3 smaller than that found at the same redshift in the
Subaru Deep field (SDF). Assuming the number density in the SDF is a cosmic
average, the probability to have a number density equal to or smaller than that
found in the SSA22 field is only 7% if we consider fluctuation by the
large-scale structure (i.e. cosmic variance) and Poisson error. Therefore, the
SSA22 field may be a rare void at $z=6.5$. On the other hand, we have found
that the number density of $i'$-drop galaxies with $25.5<z'<26.0$ in the SSA22
field agrees well with that in the SDF. If we consider a scenario that a larger
neutral fraction of intergalactic hydrogen, $x_{\rm HI}$, in the SSA22 field
obscures a part of Ly$\alpha$ emission, $x_{\rm HI}$ in the SSA22 field should
be about 2 times larger than that in the SDF. This can be translated into
$x_{\rm HI}<0.9$ at $z=6.5$ in the SSA22 field. A much larger survey area than
previous ones is required to overcome a large fluctuation reported here and to
obtain a robust constraint on $x_{\rm HI}$ at the end of the reionization from
LAEs.

in a starved magnetospheric region, above which the outflow associated with the

by the radiative inefficient flow in the vicinity of the black hole, can lead
to injection of seed charges on open magnetic field lines, with a density that
depends sensitively on accretion rate, $n_\pm\propto\dot{m}^{4}$. For an
accretion rate that corresponds to the inferred jet power, and to a fit of the
observed SED by an ADAF model, the density of injected pairs is found to be
smaller than the Goldreich-Julian density by a factor of a few. It is also
shown that inverse Compton scattering of ambient photons by electrons
(positrons) accelerating in the gap can lead to a large multiplicity, $\sim
10^3$, while still allowing photons at energies of up to a few TeV to freely
escape the system. The estimated gap width is not smaller than $0.01 r_s$ if
the density of seed charges is below the Goldreich-Julian value. The VHE power
radiated by the gap can easily account for the luminosity of the TeV source
detected by H.E.S.S. The strong dependence of injected pair density on
accretion rate should render the gap emission highly intermittent. We also
discuss briefly the application of this mechanism to Sgr A$^\star$.

started with extreme variability likely due to variable absorption, although
intrinsic white dwarf variations are not excluded. About 32 days later, a
steady decline in count-rate set in. NLTE model atmosphere spectral fits during
the super-soft phase show that the effective temperature of the white dwarf
increases from ~65 eV to ~90 eV during the extreme variability phase, falling
slowly after about day 60 and more rapidly after day 80. The bolometric
luminosity is seen to be approximately constant and close to Eddington from day
45 up to day 60, the subsequent decline possibly signalling the end of
extensive nuclear burning. Before the decline, a multiply-periodic, ~35 s
modulation of the soft X-rays was present and may be the signature of a nuclear
fusion driven instability. Our measurements are consistent with a white dwarf
mass near the Chandrasekhar limit; combined with a deduced accumulation of mass
transferred from its binary companion, this leads us to suggest RS Oph is a
strong candidate for a future supernova explosion. The main uncertainty now is
whether the WD is the CO type necessary for a SN Ia. This may be confirmed by

be much greater than the Larmor radius, thus thermal conduction is anisotropic
and along magnetic field lines. In this case, if the temperature decreases
outward, the flow may be subject to a buoyancy instability (the magnetothermal
instability, or MTI). The MTI amplifies the magnetic field, and aligns field
lines with the radial direction. If the accretion flow is differentially
rotating, the magnetorotational instability (MRI) may also be present. Using
two-dimensional, time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we investigate
the interaction between these two instabilities. We use global simulations that
span over two orders of magnitude in radius, centered on the region around the
Bondi radius where the infall time of gas is longer than the growth time of
both the MTI and MRI. Significant amplification of the magnetic field is
produced by both instabilities, although we find that the MTI primarily
amplifies the radial component, and the MRI primarily the toroidal component,
of the field, respectively. Most importantly, we find that if the MTI can
amplify the magnetic energy by a factor $F_t$, and the MRI by a factor $F_r$,
then when the MTI and MRI are both present, the magnetic energy can be
amplified by a factor of $F_t \cdot F_r$. We therefore conclude that
amplification of the magnetic energy by the MTI and MRI operates independently.
We also find that the MTI contributes to the transport of angular momentum,
because radial motions induced by the MTI increase the Maxwell (by amplifying
the magnetic field) and Reynolds stresses. Finally, we find that thermal
conduction decreases the slope of the radial temperature profile. The increased
temperature near the Bondi radius decreases the mass accretion rate.

E, Nov. 2010",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the central challenges facing modern neuroscience is to explain the
ability of the nervous system to coherently integrate information across
distinct functional modules in the absence of a central executive. To this end
Tononi et al. [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 5033 (1994)] proposed a measure of
neural complexity that purports to capture this property based on mutual
information between complementary subsets of a system. Neural complexity, so
defined, is one of a family of information theoretic metrics developed to
measure the balance between the segregation and integration of a system's
dynamics. One key question arising for such measures involves understanding how
they are influenced by network topology. Sporns et al. [Cereb. Cortex 10, 127
(2000)] employed numerical models in order to determine the dependence of
neural complexity on the topological features of a network. However, a complete
picture has yet to be established. While De Lucia et al. [Phys. Rev. E 71,
016114 (2005)] made the first attempts at an analytical account of this
relationship, their work utilized a formulation of neural complexity that, we
argue, did not reflect the intuitions of the original work. In this paper we
start by describing weighted connection matrices formed by applying a random
continuous weight distribution to binary adjacency matrices. This allows us to
derive an approximation for neural complexity in terms of the moments of the
weight distribution and elementary graph motifs. In particular we explicitly
establish a dependency of neural complexity on cyclic graph motifs.

an unsolved problem in standard econometric and financial economic approaches.
A large part of the problem is that the fundamental value of an asset is, in
general, not directly observable and it is poorly constrained to calculate.
Further, it is not possible to distinguish between an exponentially growing
fundamental price and an exponentially growing bubble price. We present a
series of new models based on the Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model, which
is a flexible tool to detect bubbles and predict changes of regime in financial
markets. Our new models identify the fundamental value of an asset price and
crash nonlinearity from a bubble calibration. In addition to forecasting the
time of the end of a bubble, the new models can also estimate the fundamental
value and the crash nonlinearity. Besides, the crash nonlinearity obtained in
the new models presents a new approach to possibly identify the dynamics of a
crash after a bubble. We test the models using data from three historical
bubbles ending in crashes from different markets. They are: the Hong Kong Hang
Seng index 1997 crash, the S&P 500 index 1987 crash and the Shanghai Composite
index 2009 crash. All results suggest that the new models perform very well in
describing bubbles, forecasting their ending times and estimating fundamental
value and the crash nonlinearity. The performance of the new models is tested
under both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian residual assumption. Under the
Gaussian residual assumption, nested hypotheses with the Wilks statistics are
used and the p-values suggest that models with more parameters are necessary.
Under non-Gaussian residual assumption, we use a bootstrap method to get type I
and II errors of the hypotheses. All tests confirm that the generalized JLS
models provide useful improvements over the standard JLS model.

question. Although accretion of gaseous water could not be the only possible
origin of the observed icy mantles covering dust grains in cold molecular
clouds, it is well known that water accreted from the gas phase on surfaces
kept at 10 K forms ice films that exhibit a very high porosity. It is also
known that in the dark clouds H2 formation occurs on the icy surface of dust
grains and that part of the energy (4.48 eV) released when adsorbed atoms react
to form H2 is deposited in the ice. The experimental study described in the
present work focuses on how relevant changes of the ice morphology result from
atomic hydrogen exposure and subsequent recombination. Using the
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) technique and a method of inversion
analysis of TPD spectra, we show that there is an exponential decrease in the
porosity of the amorphous water ice sample following D-atom irradiation. This
decrease is inversely proportional to the thickness of the ice and has a value
of Phi_0 = 2 x 10^16 D-atoms/cm^2 per layer of H2O. We also use a model which
confirms that the binding sites on the porous ice are destroyed regardless of
their energy depth, and that the reduction of the porosity corresponds in fact
to a reduction of the effective area. This reduction appears to be compatible
with the fraction of D2 formation energy transferred to the porous ice network.
Under interstellar conditions, this effect is likely to be efficient and,
together with other compaction processes, provides a good argument to believe
that interstellar ice is amorphous and non-porous.

assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that adjacent nodes do not share
the same color. The optimization version of the problem concerns the
minimization of the number of used colors. In this paper we deal with the
problem of finding valid colorings of graphs in a distributed way, that is, by
means of an algorithm that only uses local information for deciding the color
of the nodes. Such algorithms prescind from any central control. Due to the
fact that quite a few practical applications require to find colorings in a
distributed way, the interest in distributed algorithms for graph coloring has
been growing during the last decade. As an example consider wireless ad-hoc and
sensor networks, where tasks such as the assignment of frequencies or the
assignment of TDMA slots are strongly related to graph coloring.
  The algorithm proposed in this paper is inspired by the calling behavior of
Japanese tree frogs. Male frogs use their calls to attract females.
Interestingly, groups of males that are located nearby each other desynchronize
their calls. This is because female frogs are only able to correctly localize
the male frogs when their calls are not too close in time. We experimentally
show that our algorithm is very competitive with the current state of the art,
using different sets of problem instances and comparing to one of the most

modulations of the primordial power spectrum. We develop the statistical tools
needed for investigating whether these modulations are evident in the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB). The free parameters of the models are two
directional parameters (theta,phi), the signal amplitude A*, and a tilt
parameter n* that modulates correlation power on different scales. The
signature of the model corresponds to a kind of hemispherical power asymmetry.
When analyzing the 7-year WMAP data we find a weak signature for a preferred
direction in the Q-, V-, and W bands with direction (l,b) = (-225 deg,-25 deg)
+- (20 deg, 20 deg), which is close to another previously discovered
hemispherical power asymmetry. Although these results are intriguing, the
significance of the detection in the W-, V- and Q-bands are nonzero at about 2
sigma, suggesting that the simplest parameterization of the leading correction
represents only partially the effects of the space-time non-commutativity
possibly responsible for the hemispherical asymmetry. Our constraints on the

force-free magnetostatic solutions above a boundary surface on which only the
distribution of the normal magnetic field component is given. The method relies
on the theory of force-free electrodynamics and applies directly to the
reconstruction of the solar coronal magnetic field for a given distribution of
the photospheric radial field component. The method works as follows: we start
with any initial magnetostatic global field configuration (e.g. zero, dipole),
and along the boundary surface we create an evolving distribution of tangential
(horizontal) electric fields that, via Faraday's equation, give rise to a
respective normal field distribution approaching asymptotically the target
distribution. At the same time, these electric fields are used as boundary
condition to numerically evolve the resulting electromagnetic field above the
boundary surface, modelled as a thin ideal plasma with non-reflecting,
perfectly absorbing outer boundaries. The simulation relaxes to a nonlinear
force-free configuration that satisfies the given normal field distribution on
the boundary. This is different from existing methods relying on a fixed
boundary condition - the boundary evolves toward the a priori given one, at the
same time evolving the three-dimensional field solution above it. Moreover,
this is the first time a nonlinear force-free solution is reached by using only
the normal field component on the boundary. This solution is not unique, but
depends on the initial magnetic field configuration and on the evolutionary
course along the boundary surface. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that the formalism of force-free electrodynamics, used very successfully in
other astrophysical contexts, is applied to the global solar magnetic field.

star-forming disks with deep SINFONI AO spectroscopy at the ESO VLT. The clumps
reside in disk regions where the Toomre Q-parameter is below unity, consistent
with their being bound and having formed from gravitational instability. Broad
H{\alpha}/[NII] line wings demonstrate that the clumps are launching sites of
powerful outflows. The inferred outflow rates are comparable to or exceed the
star formation rates, in one case by a factor of eight. Typical clumps may lose
a fraction of their original gas by feedback in a few hundred million years,
allowing them to migrate into the center. The most active clumps may lose much
of their mass and disrupt in the disk. The clumps leave a modest imprint on the
gas kinematics. Velocity gradients across the clumps are 10-40 km/s/kpc,
similar to the galactic rotation gradients. Given beam smearing and clump
sizes, these gradients may be consistent with significant rotational support in
typical clumps. Extreme clumps may not be rotationally supported; either they
are not virialized, or they are predominantly pressure supported. The velocity
dispersion is spatially rather constant and increases only weakly with star
formation surface density. The large velocity dispersions may be driven by the
release of gravitational energy, either at the outer disk/accreting streams
interface, and/or by the clump migration within the disk. Spatial variations in
the inferred gas phase oxygen abundance are broadly consistent with inside-out
growing disks, and/or with inward migration of the clumps.

- the spatial congestion game (SCG), which is a generalization of the classical
congestion game (CG). In a classical congestion game, multiple users share the
same set of resources and a user's payoff for using any resource is a function
of the total number of users sharing it. As a potential game, this game enjoys
some very appealing properties, including the existence of a pure strategy Nash
equilibrium (NE) and that every improvement path is finite and leads to such a
NE (also called the finite improvement property or FIP). While it's tempting to
use this model to study spectrum sharing, it does not capture the spatial reuse
feature of wireless communication, where resources (interpreted as channels)
may be reused without increasing congestion provided that users are located far
away from each other. This motivates us to study an extended form of the
congestion game where a user's payoff for using a resource is a function of the
number of its interfering users sharing it. This naturally results in a spatial
congestion game (SCG), where users are placed over a network (or a conflict
graph). We study fundamental properties of a spatial congestion game; in
particular, we seek to answer under what conditions this game possesses the
finite improvement property or a Nash equilibrium. We also discuss the
implications of these results when applied to wireless spectrum sharing.

assembly pathway allows dodecahedral shells to form readily, whereas these
structures never form in the absence of the template. Secondly, we consider the
self-assembly of multi-shell structures, where the central icosahedral core is
known to form readily on its own, and which could then template the growth of
further layers. We are able to find conditions under which two- and three-shell
structures successfully assemble, illustrating the power of the templating
approach.

communities has attracted widespread attention. In this paper, I argue that the
consistency of pattern arises because diverse ecological mechanisms share a
common symmetry with regard to measurement scale. By symmetry, I mean that
different ecological processes preserve the same measure of information and
lose all other information in the aggregation of various perturbations. I frame
these explanations of symmetry, measurement, and aggregation in terms of a
recently developed extension to the theory of maximum entropy. I show that the
natural measurement scale for the species abundance distribution is log-linear:
the information in observations at small population sizes scales
logarithmically and, as population size increases, the scaling of information
grades from logarithmic to linear. Such log-linear scaling leads naturally to a
gamma distribution for species abundance, which matches well with the observed
patterns. Much of the variation between samples can be explained by the
magnitude at which the measurement scale grades from logarithmic to linear.
This measurement approach can be applied to the similar problem of allelic
diversity in population genetics and to a wide variety of other patterns in
biology.

given examples? We assume signals are generated from a fixed distribution, and
study this questions from a statistical learning theory perspective.
  We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for
two types of constraints on the coefficient selection, as measured by the
expected L_2 error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case
of l_1 regularized coefficient selection we provide a generalization bound of
the order of O(sqrt(np log(m lambda)/m)), where n is the dimension, p is the
number of elements in the dictionary, lambda is a bound on the l_1 norm of the
coefficient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing
results. For the case of representing a new signal as a combination of at most
k dictionary elements, we provide a bound of the order O(sqrt(np log(m k)/m))
under an assumption on the level of orthogonality of the dictionary (low Babel
function). We further show that this assumption holds for most dictionaries in
high dimensions in a strong probabilistic sense. Our results further yield fast

manifolds associated to discrete group duals. The basic representation theory
problem is to compute the law of the main character of the relevant quantum
group, and our main result here is as follows: for the group Z_s^{*n}, with s>4
and n>1, half of the character follows the compound free Poisson law with
respect to the measure $\underline{\epsilon}$/2, where $\epsilon$ is the
uniform measure on the s-th roots of unity, and
$\epsilon\to\underline{\epsilon}$ is the canonical projection map from complex
to real measures. We discuss as well a number of technical versions of this
result, notably with the construction of a new quantum group, which appears as
a ""representation-theoretic limit"", at s equal to infinity.

asymptotic limit of the rank 1 real Wishart spiked model. In this paper, we
consider $N$-dimensional real Wishart matrices $S$ in the class
$W_{\mathbb{R}}\left(\Sigma,M\right)$ in which all but one eigenvalues of
$\Sigma$ is $1$. Let the non-trivial eigenvalue of $\Sigma$ be $1+\tau$, then
as $N$, $M\rightarrow\infty$, with $N/M=\gamma^2$ finite and non-zero, the
eigenvalue distribution of $S$ will converge into the Machenko-Pastur
distribution inside a bulk region. As $\tau$ increases from zero, one starts
seeing stray eigenvalues of $S$ outside of the support of the Machenko-Pastur
density. As the first of these stray eigenvalues leaves the bulk region, a
phase transition will occur in the largest eigenvalue distribution of the
Wishart matrix. In this paper will compute the asymptotics of the largest
eigenvalue distribution when the phase transition occur. In the this first half
of the paper, we will establish the results that are valid for all $N$ and $M$
and will use them to carry out the asymptotic analysis in the second half of
the paper, which will follow shortly. In particular, we have derived a formula
for the integral $\int_{O(N)}e^{-\tr(XgYg^T)}g^T\D g$ when $X$, $Y$ are
symmetric and $Y$ is a rank 1 matrix. This allows us to write down a Fredholm
determinant formula for the largest eigenvalue distribution and analyze it
using orthogonal polynomial techniques. This approach is very different from a
recent paper by Bloemendal and Virag, in which the largest eigenvalue
distribution was obtained using stochastic operator method.

  23rd 2010",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the discovery of brown dwarfs in 1994, and the discovery of dust cloud
formation in the latest Very Low Mass Stars (VLMs) and Brown Dwarfs (BDs) in
1996, the most important challenge in modeling their atmospheres as become the
understanding of cloud formation and advective mixing. For this purpose, we
have developed radiation hydrodynamic 2D model atmosphere simulations to study
the formation of forsterite dust in presence of advection, condensation, and
sedimentation across the M-L-T VLMs to BDs sequence (Teff = 2800 K to 900 K,
Freytag et al. 2010). We discovered the formation of gravity waves as a driving
mechanism for the formation of clouds in these atmospheres, and derived a rule
for the velocity field versus atmospheric depth and Teff , which is relatively
insensitive to gravity. This rule has been used in the construction of the new
model atmosphere grid, BT-Settl, to determine the microturbulence velocity, the
diffusion coefficient, and the advective mixing of molecules as a function of
depth. This new model grid of atmospheres and synthetic spectra has
beencomputedfor100,000K>Teff >400K,5.5>logg>-0.5,and[M/H]=+0.5to -1.5, and the
reference solar abundances of Asplund et al. (2009). We found that the new
solar abundances allow an improved (close to perfect) reproduction of the
photo- metric and spectroscopic VLMs properties, and, for the first time, a
smooth transition between stellar and substellar regimes -- unlike the
transition between the NextGen models from Hauschildt et al. 1999a,b, and the
AMES-Dusty models from Allard et al. 2001). In the BDs regime, the BT-Settl
models propose an improved explanation for the M-L-T spectral transition. In
this paper, we therefore present the new BT-Settl model atmosphere grid, which
explains the entire transition from the stellar to planetary mass regimes.

have been powered by the dynamical decay of a non-hierarchical multiple system
$\sim$500 years ago that ejected the massive stars I, BN, and source n, with
velocities of about 10 to 30 km s$^{-1}$. New proper motion measurements of
H$_2$ features show that within the errors of measurement, the outflow
originated from the site of stellar ejection. Combined with published data,
these measurements indicate an outflow age of $\sim$500 years, similar to the
time since stellar ejection. The total kinetic energy of the ejected stars and
the outflow is about 2 to $6 \times 10^{47}$ ergs. It is proposed that the
gravitational potential energy released by the formation of a short-period
binary, most likely source I, resulted in stellar ejection and powered the
outflow. A scenario is presented for the formation of a compact,
non-hierarchical multiple star system, its decay into an ejected binary and two
high-velocity stars, and launch of the outflow. Three mechanisms may have
contributed to the explosion in the gas: (i) Unbinding of the circum-cluster
envelope following stellar ejection, (ii) disruption of circumstellar disks and
high-speed expulsion of the resulting debris during the final stellar
encounter, and (iii) the release of stored magnetic energy. Plausible
proto-stellar disk end envelope properties can produce the observed outflow
mass, velocity, and kinetic energy distributions. The ejected stars may have
acquired new disks by fall-back or Bondi-Hoyle accretion with axes roughly
orthogonal to their velocities. The expulsion of gas and stars from OMC1 may
have been driven by stellar interactions.

(3.6cm), with the VLA and the Effelsberg 100m telescope to obtain the highest
quality radio continuum images of a nearby spiral galaxy. These radio data were
combined with deconvolved Spitzer IRAC 8mum and MIPS 24mum images to search for
and investigate local changes in the radio-IR correlation.
  Utilizing wavelet decomposition, we compare the distribution of the radio and
IR emission on spatial scales between 200pc and 30kpc. We show that the
radio-IR correlation is not uniform across the galactic disk. It presents a
complex behavior with local extrema corresponding to various galactic
structures, such as complexes of HII regions, spiral arms and interarm
filaments, indicating that the contribution of the thermal and non-thermal
radio emission is a strong function of environment. In particular, the relation
of the 24mum and 20cm emission presents a linear relation within the spiral
arms and globally over the galaxy, while it deviates from linearity in the
interarm and outer regions as well in the inner region, with two different
behaviours: it is sublinear in the interarm and outer region and over-linear in
the central 3.5kpc. Our analysis suggests that the changes in the radio/IR
correlation reflect variations of ISM properties between spiral arms and
interarm region. The good correlation in the spiral arms implies that 24mum and
20cm are tracing recent star formation, while a change in the dust opacity,
'Cirrus' contribution to the IR emission and/or the relation between the
magnetic field strength and the gas density can explain the different relations
found in the interarm, outer and inner regions.
