embedded in giant molecular clouds. In these environments, the background UV
radiation fields impinging upon circumstellar disks can often dominate over the
radiation fields produced by each disk's central star. As a result, this
background radiation can drive the evaporation of circumstellar disks and lead
to the loss of planet forming potential within a cluster. This paper presents a
detailed analysis of this process for clusters whose stellar membership falls
within the range $100 \le N \le 1000$. For these intermediate-sized clusters,
the background UV field is often dominated by the most massive stellar member.
Due to the steep slope of the initial mass function, the amount of background
UV light that bathes clusters of similar size displays significant variance. As
a result, we perform a statistical analysis of this problem by calculating
distributions of FUV flux values impinging upon star/disk systems for several
cluster scenarios. We find that in the absence of dust attenuation, giant
planet formation would likely be inhibited in approximately half of systems
forming within intermediate-sized clusters regardless of stellar membership. In
contrast, the presence of dust can significantly lower this value, with the
effect considerably more pronounced in more populated clusters.

of the LT code rate and coding gain, shows that among uncoded FSK and various
classical channel coding schemes, the optimized LT coded FSK is the most
energy-efficient scheme for distance d greater than the pre-determined
threshold level d_T , where the optimization is performed over coding and
modulation parameters. In addition, although the optimized uncoded FSK
outperforms coded schemes for d < d_T , the energy gap between LT coded and
uncoded FSK is negligible for d < d_T compared to the other coded schemes.
These results come from the flexibility of the LT code to adjust its rate to
suit instantaneous channel conditions, and suggest that LT codes are beneficial

suggests that this cluster has recently undergone major merger events that
involve two or more cluster components. In this paper, we study the gas
structure and dynamics by means of spectral-imaging analysis of X-ray data
obtained from XMM-Newton and Chandra observations. From the evidence of a cold
front, we infer the westward motion of a cool core across the E-W elongated
atmosphere of the main cluster A2163-A. Located close to a galaxy over-density,
this gas 'bullet' appears to have been spatially separated from its galaxy (and
presumably dark matter component) as a result of high-velocity accretion.
  From gas brightness and temperature profile analysis performed in two
opposite regions of the main cluster, we show that the ICM has been
adiabatically compressed behind the crossing 'bullet' possibly because of shock
heating, leading to a strong departure of the ICM from hydrostatic equilibrium
in this region. Assuming that the mass estimated from the Yx proxy best
indicates the overall mass of the system and that the western cluster sector is
in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium before subcluster accretion, we infer a
merger scenario between two subunits of mass ratio 1:4, leading to a present
total system mass of M500 $\propto 1.9 \times 1015 M_{\odot}$. The exceptional
properties of A2163 present various similarities with those of 1E0657-56, the

yield injection into the ISM by all sources as well as dust destruction due to
SN shocks in the ISM. We ascertain the temporal progression of the dust mass,
the dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal mass ratios as well as other physical
properties of a galaxy and study their dependence on the mass of the galaxy,
the IMF, dust production efficiencies and dust destruction in the ISM. The
amount of dust and the physical properties of a galaxy strongly depend on the
initial gas mass available. Overall, while the total amount of dust produced
increases with galaxy mass, the detailed outcome depends on the SN dust
production efficiency, the IMF and the strength of dust destruction in the ISM.
Dust masses are higher for IMFs biased towards higher stellar masses, despite
the fact that these IMFs are more strongly affected by dust destruction in the
ISM. The sensitivity to the IMF increases as the mass of the galaxy decreases.
SNe are primarily responsible for a significant enrichment with dust at early
epochs (< 200 Myr). Dust production with a dominant contribution by AGB stars
is found to be insufficient to account for dust masses in excess of 10^8 Msun
within 400 Myr after starburst. We find that galaxies with initial gas masses
between 1-5 x 10^11 Msun are sufficiently massive to enable production of dust
masses >10^8 Msun. Our preferred scenario is dominated by SN dust production in
combination with top-heavy IMFs and moderate dust destruction in the ISM.

energy spectrum that transitions into a $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum, with increasing
wavenumber $k$. The transition occurs near a transition wavenumber $k_t$,
located near the Rossby deformation wavenumber $k_R$. The Tung-Orlando theory
interprets this spectrum as a double downscale cascade of potential enstrophy
and energy, from large scales to small scales, in which the downscale potential
enstrophy cascade coexists with the downscale energy cascade over the same
length-scale range. We show that, in a temperature forced two-layer
quasi-geostrophic model, the rates with which potential enstrophy and energy
are injected place the transition wavenumber $k_t$ near $k_R$. We also show
that if the potential energy dominates the kinetic energy in the forcing range,
then the Ekman term suppresses the upscale cascading potential enstrophy more
than it suppresses the upscale cascading energy, a behavior contrary to what
occurs in two-dimensional turbulence. As a result, the ratio $\gn/\gee$ of
injected potential enstrophy over injected energy, in the downscale direction,
decreases, thereby tending to decrease the transition wavenumber $k_t$ further.
Using a random Gaussian forcing model, we reach the same conclusion, under the
modeling assumption that the asymmetric Ekman term predominantly suppresses the
bottom layer forcing, thereby disregarding a possible entanglement between the
Ekman term and the nonlinear interlayer interaction. Based on these results, we
argue that the Tung-Orlando theory can account for the approximate coincidence
between $k_t$ and $k_R$. We also identify certain open questions that require
further investigation via numerical simulations.

cluttered background, illumination variation, occlusion, and noise, among
others. This paper presents a robust contour tracking method by contributing to
some of the key issues involved, including (a) a region functional formulation
and its optimization; (b) design of a robust and effective feature; and (c)
development of an integrated tracking algorithm. First, we formulate a region
functional based on robust Earth Mover's distance (EMD) with kernel density for
distribution modeling, and propose a two-phase method for its optimization. In
the first phase, letting the candidate contour be fixed, we express EMD as the
transportation problem and solve it by the simplex algorithm. Next, using the
theory of shape derivative, we make a perturbation analysis of the contour
around the best solution to the transportation problem. This leads to a partial
differential equation (PDE) that governs the contour evolution. Second, we
design a novel and effective feature for tracking applications. We propose a
dimensionality reduction method by tensor decomposition, achieving a
low-dimensional description of SIFT features called Tensor-SIFT for
characterizing local image region properties. Applicable to both color and
gray-level images, Tensor-SIFT is very distinctive, insensitive to illumination
changes, and noise. Finally, we develop an integrated algorithm that combines
various techniques of the simplex algorithm, narrow-band level set and fast
marching algorithms. Particularly, we introduce an inter-frame initialization
method and a stopping criterion for the termination of PDE iteration.
Experiments in challenging image sequences show that the proposed work has
promising performance.

nonlinear physical systems where it is known as the kink-soliton. Our approach
enables the conversion of hierarchical structural information into a

of a small number of global parameters that are in principle computable from
atomary level considerations. As an example we describe in detail how the
native fold of the myoglobin 1M6C emerges from a combination of kink-solitons

no overhead for deletions. All these bounds are essentially optimal. While DHT
schemes with similar guarantees are already known in the literature, this work
is new in the following aspects:
  (1) It presents a rigorous mathematical analysis of the scheme under a
general stochastic model of churn and shows the above guarantees;
  (2) The theoretical analysis is complemented by a simulation-based analysis
that validates the asymptotic bounds even in moderately sized networks and also
studies performance under changing stable network size;
  (3) The presented scheme seems especially suitable for maintaining dynamic
structures under churn efficiently. In particular, we show that a spanning tree
of low diameter can be efficiently maintained in constant time and logarithmic

states are realized by utilizing both charge and spin of carriers. Spin-valve
structures used in modern hard drive read-heads and magnetic random access
memories comprise two ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes whose relative
magnetization orientations can be switched between parallel and antiparallel
configurations, yielding the desired giant or tunneling magnetoresistance
effect. In this paper we demonstrate >100$% spin-valve-like signal in a
NiFe/IrMn/MgO/Pt stack with an antiferromagnet (AFM) on one side and a
non-magnetic metal on the other side of the tunnel barrier. FM moments in NiFe
are reversed by external fields <50mT and the exchange-spring effect of NiFe on
IrMn induces rotation of AFM moments in IrMn which is detected by the measured
tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR). Our work demonstrates a
spintronic element whose transport characteristics are governed by an AFM. It
demonstrates that sensitivity to low magnetic fields can be combined with
large, spin-orbit coupling induced magneto-transport anisotropy using a single
magnetic electrode. The AFM-TAMR provides means to study magnetic
characteristics of AFM films by an electronic transport measurement.

The resonance enhancement, which can be a measure of the area of sign reversal

other iron-based superconductors without line nodes. This fact indicates that
the sign reversal between the FSs is still dominant in this system, and the

Hence the system can hold relatively high-Tc. Comparison with theoretical

We find that thin networks are linearly stable, whereas thick networks are

antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, whose preliminary version has been sketched
recently by the present author [1](arXiv:0901.3896v2 (cond.-mat.sup-con)).
Starting from the t-J Hamiltonian, I show that the formal failure of the
perturbation theory leads to a transformation to the pseudogap phase. This
phase is characterized by the aggregation of the holes into rows and columns,
which in turn results in two internal fields. The first is the modulated AFM
field, whose main evidence comes from Neutron scattering experiments. The
second internal field is made up by the checkerboard charge density waves that
have been observed by Scanning Tunneling Measurements. The present paper deals
mainly with the internal field of the first type, and discusses the second type
only tentatively. Formalism is derived that yields the ground state, the
internal field, the Hamiltonian, and the propagators of the condensed phase.
Our results resolve the presumably inherent self contradictory concept of
pseudogap. It is shown that the excitation energy spectrum is gapless despite
the order parameter that is inherent to the condensed system. In addition, it
is shown qualitatively that our model predicts ""Fermi surface"" that is in
agreement with experiment.

a master equation, which we treat within a generalized Gutzwiller mean field
approximation for density matrices. The dissipative processes are engineered
such that the system, in the absence of interaction between the bosons, is
driven into a homogeneous steady state with off-diagonal long range order. We
investigate how the coherent interaction affects qualitatively the properties
of the steady state of the system and derive a nonequilibrium phase diagram
featuring a phase transition into a steady state without long range order. The
phase diagram exhibits also an extended domain where an instability of the
homogeneous steady state gives rise to a persistent density pattern with
spontaneously broken translational symmetry. In the limit of small particle
density, we provide a precise analytical description of the time-evolution
during the instability. Moreover, we investigate the transient following a

One of the questions was, which surfaces satisfy the following property (which
is called Veech's dichotomy): Any direction is either completely periodic or
uniquely ergodic. In an important paper Veech gave a sufficient condition for
this dichotomy. He showed that if the stabilizer of a translation surface is a
lattice in $SL_2(\R)$, then the surface satisfies Veech's dichotomy. Later,
Smillie and Weiss proved that this condition is not necessary. They constructed
a translation surface which satisfies Veech's dichotomy but is not a lattice
surface. Their construction was based on previous work of Hubert and Schmidt,
by taking a branched cover over a lattice surface, where the branch locus is a
single non-periodic connection point. In this work we tried to answer the
following question: Is there a flat structure obtained from a billiard table
that satisfies Veech's dichotomy, but its Veech group is not a lattice? We
prove that in the entire list of possible candidates for such a construction,
an example does not exist.

energies, where the most extreme flux and spectral variations are expected to
occur, witnessing changes in the accretion flow or in the kinematics of the
plasma. In active galactic nuclei of blazar type, these variations are the most
dramatic. By following blazar outbursts from their onset and by correlating the
observed variations at many different wavelengths we can reconstruct the
behavior of the plasma and map out the development of the flare within the jet.
The advent of the Fermi satellite has allowed the start of a systematic and
intensive monitoring program of blazars. Blazar outbursts are very effectively
detected by the LAT instrument in the MeV-GeV domain, and these can be promptly
followed up with other facilities. Based on a Fermi LAT detection of a high
MeV-GeV state, we have observed the blazar PKS 1502+106 with the INTEGRAL
satellite between 9 and 11 August 2008. Simultaneous Swift observations have
been also accomplished, as well as optical follow-up at the Nordic Optical
Telescope. The IBIS instrument onboard INTEGRAL detected a source at a position
inconsistent with the optical coordinates of PKS 1502+106, but consistent with
those of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mkn 841, located at 6.8 arcmin south-west from
the blazar, which is therefore responsible for all the hard X-ray flux detected
by IBIS. At the location of the blazar, IBIS sets an upper limit of ~10^{-11}
erg/s/cm2 on the 15-60 keV flux, that turns out to be consistent with a model
of inverse Compton scattering accounting for the soft X-ray and gamma-ray
spectra measured by Swift XRT and Fermi LAT, respectively. The gamma-ray
spectrum during the outburst indicates substantial variability of the
characteristic energy of the inverse Compton component in this
blazar.(abridged).

known, but the implementation of this idea for effective field theories with a
dimensional coupling constant is in general less useful. Nevertheless there are
multiple attempts to define running couplings including the effects of gravity,
with varying conclusions. We sort through many of the issues involved, most
particularly the idea of operator mixing and also the kinematics of crossing,
using calculations in Yukawa and lambda phi^4 theory as illustrative examples.
We remain in the perturbative regime. In some theories with a high permutation
symmetry, such as lambda phi^4, a reasonable running coupling can be defined.
However in most cases, such as Yukawa and gauge theories, a running coupling
fails to correctly account for the energy dependence of the interaction
strength. As a byproduct we also contrast on-shell and off-shell renormalizaton
schemes and show that operators which are normally discarded, such as those
that vanish by the equations of motion, are required for off-shell
renormalization of effective field theories. Our results suggest that the
inclusion of gravity in the running of couplings is not useful or universal in
the description of physical processes.
