shear oscillations within an accuracy of about a few per cent. For dipole
magnetic fields between 5 x 10^13 and 10^15 G the Alfv\'en oscillations become
modified substantially by the presence of the crust. Those quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) split into three families: Lower QPOs near the equator,
Edge QPOs related to the last open field line and Upper QPOs at larger distance
from the equator. Edge QPOs are called so because they are related to an edge
in the corresponding Alfv\'en continuum. The Upper QPOs are of the same kind,
while the Lower QPOs are turning-point QPOs, related to a turning point in the

similar fashion to low-mass stars. Jet-driven molecular outflows play an
important role in this scenario, and their study can help to understand the
process of high-mass star formation and the different evolutionary phases
involved. Observations towards low-mass protostars so far favour an
evolutionary picture in which jets are always associated with Class 0 objects
while more evolved Class I/II objects show less evidence of powerful jets. The
present study aims at checking whether an analogous picture can be found in the
high-mass case. The IRAM 30-m telescope (Spain) has been used to perform
single-pointing SiO(2-1) and (3-2) observations towards a sample of 57
high-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages. Continuum data at
different wavelengths, from mid-IR to 1.2 mm, have been gathered to build the
spectral energy distributions of all the clumps and estimate their bolometric
luminosities. SiO emission at high velocities, characteristic of molecular
jets, is detected in 88% of our sources, a very high detection rate indicating
that there is ongoing star formation activity in most of the sources of our
sample. The SiO(2-1) luminosity drops with L/M, which suggests that jet
activity declines as time evolves. This represents the first clear evidence of
a decrease of SiO outflow luminosity with time in a homogeneous sample of
high-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages. The SiO(3-2) to
SiO(2-1) integrated intensity ratio shows only minor changes with evolutionary
state.

of novel measurement techniques. One particularly promising new technique
demonstrated in recent experiments uses strong fluorescent laser scattering
from neutral atoms confined in a short-period optical lattice to measure the
position of individual atoms in the sample. A crucial condition for the
measurements is that atomic hopping between lattice sites must be strongly
suppressed despite substantial photon recoil heating. This article models
three-dimensional polarization gradient cooling of atoms trapped within a
far-detuned optical lattice. The atomic dynamics are simulated using a hybrid
Monte Carlo and master equation analysis in order to predict the frequency of
processes which give rise to degradation or loss of the fluorescent signal
during measurements. It is shown, consistent with the experimental results,
that there exists a wide parameter range in which the lifetime of
strongly-fluorescing isolated lattice-trapped atoms is limited by background
gas collisions rather than radiative processes. In these cases the total number
of scattered photons can be as large as 10^8 per atom. The performance of the
technique is related to relevant experimental parameters.

in the physical literature is studied. It is shown that, in contrast to other
existing relativistic models, the one considered in this paper is invariant
under Lorentz transformations in the absence of friction. A similar property
(invariance by Galilean transformations in the absence of friction) is verified
in the non-relativistic case. In the first part of the paper some fundamental
mathematical properties of the relativistic Fokker-Planck equation are
established. In particular, it is proved that the model is compatible with the
finite propagation speed of particles in relativity. In the second part of the
paper, two non-linear relativistic mean-field models are introduced. One is
obtained by coupling the relativistic Fokker-Planck equation to the Maxwell
equations of electrodynamics, and is therefore of interest in plasma physics.
The other mean-field model couples the Fokker-Planck dynamics to a relativistic
scalar theory of gravity (the Nordstr\""om theory) and is therefore of interest
in gravitational physics. In both cases the existence of steady states for all
possible prescribed values of the mass is established. In the gravitational
case this result is better than for the corresponding non-relativistic model,
the Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck system, for which existence of steady states
is known only for small mass.

  Electrolyte Solution Under an External Electric Field","63 pages, 11 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we follow the general idea of the Onsager--Wilson theory of
strong binary electrolyte solutions and completely calculate the velocity
profile of ionic flow by first formally solving the hydrodynamic (Stokes)
equation for the ionic solutions subjected to an external electric field by a
Fourier transform method and then explicitly evaluating the formal Fourier
transform solutions as functions of spatial positions and field strength. Thus
the axial and transversal components of the velocity and the accompanying
nonequilibrium pressure are explicitly obtained. They are rare examples for
solutions of a hydrodynamic equation for flow in an external electric field.
The present results make it possible to investigate ways to overcome the
mathematical difficulty (divergence) inherent to the method of evaluating the
formal solutions that Wilson used in his dissertation on the conductance theory
(namely, the Onsager--Wilson theory) for strong binary electrolytes. Some
examples for the velocity profiles are numerically computed. They show how ions
might move in the ionic solution under an external electric field. A possible
way to get rid of the divergence causing terms for the electrophoretic effect
is examined. In the sequels, the results obtained in this work will be applied
to study ionic conductivity and related transport processes in electrolyte
solutions.

near infrared (so-called IR flares). One model of these events consists in a
hotspot orbiting on the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the hole.
These outbursts can be used as a probe of the central gravitational potential.
One main scientific goal of the second generation VLTI instrument GRAVITY is to
observe these flares astrometrically. Here, the astrometric precision of
GRAVITY is investigated in imaging mode, which consists in analysing the image
computed from the interferometric data. The capability of the instrument to put
in light the motion of a hotspot orbiting on the ISCO of our central black hole
is then discussed.
  We find that GRAVITY's astrometric precision for a single star in imaging
mode is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius of Sgr A*. The instrument can
also demonstrate that a body orbiting on the last stable orbit of the black
hole is indeed moving. It yields a typical size of the orbit, if the source is
as bright as m_K=14.
  These results show that GRAVITY allows one to study the close environment of
Sgr A*. Having access to the ISCO of the central massive black hole probably
allows constraining general relativity in its strong regime. Moreover, if the
hotspot model is appropriate, the black hole spin can be constrained.

perturbations of the Maxwellian equilibrium states, as announced in
\cite{gsNonCutA}. We more generally cover collision kernels with parameters
$s\in (0,1)$ and $\gamma$ satisfying $\gamma > -n$ in arbitrary dimensions
$\mathbb{T}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\ge 2$. Moreover, we prove rapid
convergence as predicted by the celebrated Boltzmann $H$-theorem. When $\gamma
\ge -2s$, we have exponential time decay to the Maxwellian equilibrium states.
When $\gamma <-2s$, our solutions decay polynomially fast in time with any
rate. These results are completely constructive. Additionally, we prove sharp
constructive upper and lower bounds for the linearized collision operator in
terms of a geometric fractional Sobolev norm; we thus observe that a spectral
gap exists only when $\gamma \ge -2s$, as conjectured in Mouhot-Strain
\cite{MR2322149}. It will be observed that this fundamental equation, derived
by both Boltzmann and Maxwell, grants a basic example where a range of
geometric fractional derivatives occur in a physical model of the natural
world. Our methods provide a new understanding of the grazing collisions in the

the so called {\em multibreather stability theorem} previously developed by
some of the authors [Physica D {\bf 180} 235]. A numerical analysis confirms
the analytical predictions and gives a detailed picture of the existence and
stability properties for arbitrary frequency and coupling.

consensus algorithms, which iteratively compute the measurement average by
message passing among nodes. It is usually assumed that these algorithms
converge faster with a greater exchange of information (i.e., by increased
network connectivity) in every iteration. However, when interference is taken
into account, it is no longer clear if the rate of convergence increases with
network connectivity. We study this problem for randomly-placed
consensus-seeking nodes connected through an interference-limited network. We
investigate the following questions: (a) How does the rate of convergence vary
with increasing communication range of each node? and (b) How does this result
change when each node is allowed to communicate with a few selected far-off
nodes? When nodes schedule their transmissions to avoid interference, we show
that the convergence speed scales with $r^{2-d}$, where $r$ is the
communication range and $d$ is the number of dimensions. This scaling is the
result of two competing effects when increasing $r$: Increased schedule length
for interference-free transmission vs. the speed gain due to improved
connectivity. Hence, although one-dimensional networks can converge faster from
a greater communication range despite increased interference, the two effects
exactly offset one another in two-dimensions. In higher dimensions, increasing
the communication range can actually degrade the rate of convergence. Our
results thus underline the importance of factoring in the effect of
interference in the design of distributed estimation algorithms.

Here, we investigate possible theoretical explanations, including proton

In particular, we investigate a conceivable small modification of the spectral
function of vacuum polarization in between the electron and muon energy scales
due to a virtual millicharged particle and due to an unstable vector boson
originating from a hidden sector of an extended standard model. We find that a
virtual millicharged particle which could explain the muonic Lamb shift
discrepancy alters theoretical predictions for the muon anomalous magnetic
moment by many standard deviations and therefore is in conflict with
experiment. Also, we find no parameterizations of an unstable virtual vector
boson which could simultaneously explain both ""muonic"" discrepancies without
significantly altering theoretical predictions for electronic hydrogen, where
theory and experiment currently are in excellent agreement. A process-dependent
correction involving electron screening is evaluated to have the right sign and
order-of-magnitude to explain the observed effect in muonic hydrogen.
Additional experimental evidence from light muonic atoms and ions is needed in

Our finding calls for a re-examination of the definition of a topological

non-interacting electrons in the presence of strong disorder. In the clean
limit, the model displays a topological insulating phase with spin-Chern number
$C_s$=2 and gapped edge states. In the presence of disorder, level statistics
on energy spectrum reveals regions of extended states displaying levitation and

robust against disorder. By driving the Fermi level over the mobility edges, it
is shown that this invariant is precisely the spin-Chern number. The protection

In particular, we exhibit the paramount role of the unstable manifold of
selected periodic orbits which lead to a delay in these double ionizations.
Among delayed double ionizations, we consider the case of ""Recollision
Excitation with Subsequent Ionization"" (RESI) and, as a hallmark of this
mechanism, we predict oscillations in the ratio of RESI to double ionization

the potential improvement in well productivity, well placement decision is an
important issue in field development. Considering complex reservoir geology and
high reservoir heterogeneities, stochastic optimization methods are the most
suitable approaches for optimum well placement. This paper proposes an
optimization methodology to determine optimal well location and trajectory
based upon the Covariance Matrix Adaptation - Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) which
is a variant of Evolution Strategies recognized as one of the most powerful
derivative-free optimizers for continuous optimization. To improve the
optimization procedure, two new techniques are investigated: (1). Adaptive
penalization with rejection is developed to handle well placement constraints.
(2). A meta-model, based on locally weighted regression, is incorporated into
CMA-ES using an approximate ranking procedure. Therefore, we can reduce the
number of reservoir simulations, which are computationally expensive. Several
examples are presented. Our new approach is compared with a Genetic Algorithm
incorporating the Genocop III technique. It is shown that our approach
outperforms the genetic algorithm: it leads in general to both a higher NPV and
a significant reduction of the number of reservoir simulations.

compression problem where computation of a function (or, some functions) of
sources located at certain nodes in a network is desired at receiver(s). The
rate region of this problem has been considered in the literature under certain
restrictive assumptions, particularly in terms of the network topology, the
functions and the characteristics of the sources. In this paper, we present
results that significantly relax these assumptions. Firstly, we consider this
problem for an arbitrary tree network and asymptotically lossless computation.
We show that, for depth one trees with correlated sources, or for general trees
with independent sources, a modularized coding scheme based on graph colorings
and Slepian-Wolf compression performs arbitrarily closely to rate lower bounds.
For a general tree network with independent sources, optimal computation to be
performed at intermediate nodes is derived. We introduce a necessary and
sufficient condition on graph colorings of any achievable coding scheme, called
coloring connectivity condition (C.C.C.).
  Secondly, we investigate the effect of having several functions at the
receiver. In this problem, we derive a rate region and propose a coding scheme
based on graph colorings. Thirdly, we consider the functional compression
problem with feedback. We show that, in this problem, unlike Slepian-Wolf
compression, by having feedback, one may outperform rate bounds of the case
without feedback. Fourthly, we investigate functional computation problem with
distortion. We compute a rate-distortion region for this problem. Then, we
propose a simple suboptimal coding scheme with a non-trivial performance
guarantee. Finally, we introduce cases where finding minimum entropy colorings
and therefore, optimal coding schemes can be performed in polynomial time.

black hole at the Galactic centre. We find a generic set of solutions, and make
specific predictions for currently feasible rotation measure (RM) observations,
which are accessible to current instruments including the EVLA, GMRT and ALMA.
The slow time variability of the RM is a key quantitative signature of this
accretion flow. The time variability of RM can be used to quantitatively
measure the nature of the accretion flow, and to differentiate models.
Sensitive measurements of RM can be achieved using RM synthesis or using
pulsars.
  Our energy conserving ideal magneto-hydrodynamical simulations, which achieve
high dynamical range by means of a deformed-mesh algorithm, stretch from
several Bondi radii to about one thousandth of that radius, and continue for
tens of Bondi times. Magnetized flows which lack outward convection possess
density slopes around -1, almost independent of physical parameters, and are
more consistent with observational constraints than are strongly convective
flows We observe no tendency for the flows to become rotationally supported in
their centres, or to develop steady outflow.
  We support these conclusions with formulae which encapsulate our findings in
terms of physical and numerical parameters. We discuss the relation of these
solutions to other approaches. The main potential uncertainties are the
validity of ideal MHD and the absence of a fully relativistic inner boundary
condition. The RM variability predictions are testable with current and future
telescopes.

show a prominent emission line at 9735A and 9858A respectively: the lines have

blue side and a tail on the red side. The asymmetry is quantitatively
comparable to the observed asymmetry in z ~ 6 Ly-alpha lines, where absorption
by neutral hydrogen in the IGM truncates the blue side of the emission line

lower redshift and we are observing either [OII], [OIII] or H-alpha emission:

galaxies in the reionization epoch. Based on their redshifts and broad--band

about an order of magnitude stronger than constraints on this population
derived from the intensity of the IGRB alone. We also examine the possibility
of a MSP component in the IGRB mimicking a dark matter signal in

what enrichment patterns can reproduce the observed median optical depth of CIV

constraints if the z=3 IGM was primarily enriched by galaxies that reside in
low-mass (m_tot<10^10 M_sun) haloes that can eject metals out to distances

observations as they are too rare for their outflows to cover a sufficiently
large fraction of the volume. Galaxies need to enrich gas out to distances that
are much greater than the virial radii of their host haloes. Assuming the
metals to be well mixed on small scales, our modeling requires that the
fractions of the simulated volume and baryonic mass that are polluted with

using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on board the Hubble Space Telescope.
Previous studies of this early-type galaxy (ETG) indicate that it has a large
reservoir of molecular gas, exhibits a kinematically decoupled core (likely
indication of recent merging) and strong, central H_B absorption (indicative of
young stars). The core of NGC 4150 shows ubiquitous near-UV emission and
remarkable dusty substructure. Our analysis shows this galaxy to lie in the
near-UV green valley, and its pixel-by-pixel photometry exhibits a narrow range
of near-UV/optical colours that are similar to those of nearby E+A
(post-starburst) galaxies. We parametrise the properties of the recent star
formation (age, mass fraction, metallicity and internal dust content) in the
NGC 4150 pixels by comparing the observed near-UV/optical photometry to stellar
models. The typical age of the recent star formation (RSF) is around 0.9 Gyrs,
consistent with the similarity of the near-UV colours to post-starburst
systems, while the morphological structure of the young component supports the
proposed merger scenario. The RSF metallicity, representative of the
metallicity of the gas fuelling star formation, is around 0.3 - 0.5 Zsun.
Assuming that this galaxy is a merger and that the gas is sourced mainly from
the infalling companion, these metallicities plausibly indicate the gas-phase
metallicity (GPM) of the accreted satellite. Comparison to the local mass-GPM
relation suggests (crudely) that the mass of the accreted system is around
3x10^8 Msun, making NGC 4150 a 1:20 minor merger. A summation of the pixel RSF
mass fractions indicates that the RSF contributes about 2-3 percent of the
stellar mass. This work reaffirms our hypothesis that minor mergers play a
significant role in the evolution of ETGs at late epochs.

present the first results, based on Gemini GMOS-S nod-and-shuffle spectroscopy
of seven galaxy groups selected from spectroscopically confirmed, extended XMM
detections in COSMOS. In total we have over 100 confirmed group members, and
four of the groups have >15 members. The dynamical mass estimates are in good
agreement with the masses estimated from the X-ray luminosity, with most of the
groups having 13<log(Mdyn/Msun)<14. Our spectroscopic sample is statistically
complete for all galaxies with Mstar>1E10.1 Msun, and for blue galaxies we
sample masses as low as Mstar=1E8.8 Msun. Like lower-redshift groups, these
systems are dominated by red galaxies, at all stellar masses Mstar>1E10.1 Msun.
Few group galaxies inhabit the ""blue cloud"" that dominates the surrounding
field; instead, we find a large and possibly distinct population of galaxies
with intermediate colours. The ""green valley"" that exists at low redshift is
instead well-populated in these groups, containing ~30 per cent of galaxies.
These do not appear to be exceptionally dusty galaxies, and about half show
prominent Balmer-absorption lines. Furthermore, their HST morphologies appear
to be intermediate between those of red-sequence and blue-cloud galaxies of the
same stellar mass. We postulate that these are a transient population,
migrating from the blue cloud to the red sequence, with a star formation rate
that declines with an exponential timescale 0.6 Gyr< tau < 2 Gyr. Their
prominence among the group galaxy population, and the marked lack of blue,
star-forming galaxies, provides evidence that the group environment either
directly reduces star formation in member galaxies, or at least prevents its
rejuvenation during the normal cycle of galaxy evolution.

address this issue by characterizing the variability in neutrino cooled

exhibiting a Double- Continuum Fano (DCF) optical resonance. Such metamaterial
is described as a birefringent medium supporting a discrete ""dark""
electromagnetic state weakly coupled to the continua of two nondegen- erate
""bright"" bands of orthogonal polarizations. It is demonstrated that light
propagation through such DCF metamaterial can be slowed down over a broad
frequency range when the medium param- eters (e.g. frequency of the ""dark""
mode) are adiabatically changed along the optical path. Using a specific
metamaterial implementation, we demonstrate that the DCF approach to slow light
(SL) is superior to that of the EIT because it enables spectrally uniform group
velocity and transmission coefficient.

  and Market Structure","61 pages",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we study stochastic dynamic games with many players; these are
a fundamental model for a wide range of economic applications. The standard
solution concept for such games is Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), but it is
well known that MPE computation becomes intractable as the number of players
increases. We instead consider the notion of stationary equilibrium (SE), where
players optimize assuming the empirical distribution of others' states remains
constant at its long run average. We make two main contributions. First, we
provide a rigorous justification for using SE. In particular, we provide a
parsimonious collection of exogenous conditions over model primitives that
guarantee existence of SE, and ensure that an appropriate approximation
property to MPE holds, in a general model with possibly unbounded state spaces.
Second, we draw a significant connection between the validity of SE, and market
structure: under the same conditions that imply SE exist and approximates MPE
well, the market becomes fragmented in the limit of many firms. To illustrate
this connection, we study in detail a series of dynamic oligopoly examples.
These examples show that our conditions enforce a form of ""decreasing returns
to larger states""; this yields fragmented industries in the limit. By contrast,
violation of these conditions suggests ""increasing returns to larger states""
and potential market concentration. In that sense, our work uses a fully
dynamic framework to also contribute to a longstanding issue in industrial
organization: understanding the determinants of market structure in different
industries.

pendant branches leading to tips can be very short compared to branches deeper

birth-death models. We show how censoring at the present both makes average

roughly equal in length. Although dependent on whether we condition on the size
of the tree, its age, or both, these results hold both for the Yule model and
for birth-death models with moderate extinction. Importantly, the rough
equivalency in interior and exterior branch lengths means the loss of
evolutionary history with loss of species can be roughly linear. Under these

transport through a single-molecule magnet (SMM) with an arbitrary angle
between the applied magnetic field and the SMM's easy axis above the sequential
tunneling threshold, since the angle $\theta$ cannot be controlled in
present-day SMM experiments. In the absence of the small transverse anisotropy,
when the coupling of the SMM with the incident-electrode is stronger than that
with the outgoing-electrode, i.e., $\Gamma_{L}/\Gamma_{R}\gg1$, the maximum
peak of shot noise first increases and then decreases with increasing $\theta$
from 0 to $0.5\pi$. In particular, the shot noise can reach up to
super-Poissonian value from sub-Poissonian value when considering the small
transverse anisotropy. For $\Gamma_{L}/\Gamma_{R}\ll1$, the maximum peaks of
the shot noise and skewness can be reduced from a super-Poissonian to a
sub-Poissonian value with increasing $\theta$ from 0 to $0.5\pi$; the
super-Poissonian behavior of the skewness is more sensitive to the small
$\theta$ than shot noise, which is suppressed when taking into account the
small transverse anisotropy. These characteristics of shot noise can be
qualitatively attributed to the competition between the fast and slow transport
channels. The predictions regarding of the $\theta$-dependence of high order
current cumulants are very interesting for a better understanding electron
transport through SMM, and will allow for experimental tests in the near

construct in $\tilde O(S)$ time a data structure of size $O(S)$ that answers
distance queries in $\tilde O(n/\sqrt S)$ time per query.
  As a consequence, we obtain an improvement over the fastest algorithm for
k-many distances in planar graphs whenever $k\in[\sqrt n,n)$.
  * We provide a linear-space exact distance oracle for planar graphs with
query time $O(n^{1/2+eps})$ for any constant eps>0. This is the first such data
structure with provable sublinear query time.
  * For edge lengths at least one, we provide an exact distance oracle of space
$\tilde O(n)$ such that for any pair of nodes at distance D the query time is
$\tilde O(min {D,\sqrt n})$. Comparable query performance had been observed
experimentally but has never been explained theoretically.
  Our data structures are based on the following new tool: given a
non-self-crossing cycle C with $c = O(\sqrt n)$ nodes, we can preprocess G in
$\tilde O(n)$ time to produce a data structure of size $O(n \lg\lg c)$ that can
answer the following queries in $\tilde O(c)$ time: for a query node u, output
the distance from u to all the nodes of C. This data structure builds on and
extends a related data structure of Klein (SODA'05), which reports distances to
the boundary of a face, rather than a cycle.
  The best distance oracles for planar graphs until the current work are due to
Cabello (SODA'06), Djidjev (WG'96), and Fakcharoenphol and Rao (FOCS'01). For
$\sigma\in(1,4/3)$ and space $S=n^\sigma$, we essentially improve the query

diagonal terms. These terms emerge due to the presence of a correlational
structure (embedding constraints) among the statistical variables on the larger
manifold and are characterized by macroscopic correlational coefficients r_{k}.
First, we observe a power law decay of the information geometric complexity at
a rate determined by the coefficients r_{k} and conclude that the non-trivial
off diagonal terms lead to the emergence of an asymptotic information geometric
compression of the explored macrostates {\Theta} on M_{s}. Finally, we observe
that the presence of such embedding constraints leads to an attenuation of the
asymptotic exponential divergence of the Jacobi vector field intensity.

protocol cannot cause more harm than in an ideal computation where parties give
their inputs to a trusted party which returns the output of the functionality
to all parties. In particular, in the ideal model such computation is fair --
all parties get the output. Cleve (STOC 1986) proved that, in general, fairness
is not possible without an honest majority. To overcome this impossibility,
Gordon and Katz (Eurocrypt 2010) suggested a relaxed definition -- 1/p-secure
computation -- which guarantees partial fairness. For two parties, they
construct 1/p-secure protocols for functionalities for which the size of either
their domain or their range is polynomial (in the security parameter). Gordon
and Katz ask whether their results can be extended to multiparty protocols.
  We study 1/p-secure protocols in the multiparty setting for general
functionalities. Our main result is constructions of 1/p-secure protocols when
the number of parties is constant provided that less than 2/3 of the parties
are corrupt. Our protocols require that either (1) the functionality is
deterministic and the size of the domain is polynomial (in the security
parameter), or (2) the functionality can be randomized and the size of the
range is polynomial. If the size of the domain is constant and the
functionality is deterministic, then our protocol is efficient even when the
number of parties is O(log log n) (where n is the security parameter). On the
negative side, we show that when the number of parties is super-constant,
1/p-secure protocols are not possible when the size of the domain is
polynomial.

increases, a narrow-gap topologically trivial insulator undergoes a series of

with stellar noise produced by 3 different physical phenomena: oscillations,
granulation phenomena (granulation, meso- and super-granulation) and activity.
On solar type stars, these 3 types of perturbation can induce m/s RV variation,
but on different time scales: 3 to 15 minutes for oscillations, 15 minutes to
1.5 days for granulation phenomena and 10 to 50 days for activity. The high
precision observational strategy used on HARPS, 1 measure per night of 15
minutes, on 10 consecutive days each month, is optimized, due to a long
exposure time, to average out the noise coming from oscillations (Dumusque et
al. 2010) but not to reduce the noise coming from granulation and activity. The
smallest planets found with this strategy (Mayor et al. 2009) seems to be at
the limit of the actual observational strategy and not at the limit of the
instrumental precision. To be able to find Earth mass planets in the habitable
zone of solar-type stars (200 days for a K0 dwarf), new observational
strategies, averaging out simultaneously all type of stellar noise, are
required.

  on a Budget",,,,,"cs.DS cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The neighbourhood function N(t) of a graph G gives, for each t, the number of
pairs of nodes <x, y> such that y is reachable from x in less that t hops. The
neighbourhood function provides a wealth of information about the graph (e.g.,
it easily allows one to compute its diameter), but it is very expensive to
compute it exactly. Recently, the ANF algorithm (approximate neighbourhood
function) has been proposed with the purpose of approximating NG(t) on large
graphs. We describe a breakthrough improvement over ANF in terms of speed and
scalability. Our algorithm, called HyperANF, uses the new HyperLogLog counters
and combines them efficiently through broadword programming; our implementation
uses overdecomposition to exploit multi-core parallelism. With HyperANF, for
the first time we can compute in a few hours the neighbourhood function of
graphs with billions of nodes with a small error and good confidence using a
standard workstation. Then, we turn to the study of the distribution of the
shortest paths between reachable nodes (that can be efficiently approximated by
means of HyperANF), and discover the surprising fact that its index of
dispersion provides a clear-cut characterisation of proper social networks vs.

transition involves first the grain boundary, while for $g \sim g_{intr}$ the
transition occurs into the whole grain. The different intergrain coupling is
considered by modelling the superconducting material as a disordered network of

disorder, the resistive transition occurs for lower temperatures and the curve
broadens. These features are enhanced in disordered superconductors with strong
links. The different behaviour is further checked by estimating the average
network resistance for weak and strong links in the framework of the effective
medium approximation theory. These results may be relevant to shed light on
long standing puzzles as: (i) enhancement of the superconducting transition

framework of the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model. A phase transition from
quark--gluon plasma to hadrons, a hadronization, has been conjectured in order
to allow modifications in the phase space volume and thus in single--particle
distribution function. Implementing both modifications in the grand--canonical
partition function and taking into account the experimental acceptance in
heavy-ion collisions, the antiproton-to-proton ratios over center-of-mass
energies $\sqrt{s}$ ranging from AGS to RHIC are very well reproduced by the
HRG model. Comparing with the same particle ratios in $pp$ collisions results
in a gradually narrowing discrepancy with increasing $\sqrt{s}$. At LHC energy,
the ALICE antiproton-to-proton ratios in $pp$ collisions turn to be very well
described by HRG model as well. It is likely that the ALICE heavy-ion program
will produce the same antiproton-to-proton ratios as the $pp$ program.
Furthermore, the ratio gets very close to unity indicating that the
matter-antimatter asymmetry nearly vanishes. The chemical potential calculated
at this energy strengthens the assumption of almost fully matter-antimatter
symmetry at LHC energy.

erg/s) and therefore X-rays are expected to affect the physics and chemistry of
the upper layers of their surrounding protoplanetary disks.
  Aim: The effects and importance of X-rays on the chemical and hydrostatic
structure of protoplanetary disks are investigated, species tracing X-ray
irradiation (for L_X >= 10^29 erg/s) are identified and predictions for [OI],
[CII] and [NII] fine structure line fluxes are provided.
  Methods: We have implemented X-ray physics and chemistry into the
chemo-physical disk code ProDiMo. We include Coulomb heating and H2 ionization
as heating processes and primary and secondary ionization due to X-rays in the
chemistry.
  Results: X-rays heat up the gas causing it to expand in the optically thin
surface layers. Neutral molecular species are not much affected in their
abundance and spatial distribution, but charged species such as N+, OH+, H2O+
and H3O+ show enhanced abundances in the disk surface.
  Conclusions: Coulomb heating by X-rays changes the vertical structure of the
disk, yielding temperatures of ~ 8000 K out to distances of 50 AU. The chemical
structure is altered by the high electron abundance in the gas in the disk
surface, causing an efficient ion-molecule chemistry. The products of this,
OH+, H2O+ and H3O+, are of great interest for observations of low-mass young
stellar objects with the Herschel Space Observatory. [OI] (at 63 and 145 mic)

are connected by bipartite entangled states. These networks are characterized
by a complex structure, which dramatically affects how information is
transmitted through them. For pure quantum state links, quantum networks
exhibit a remarkable feature absent in classical networks: it is possible to
effectively rewire the network by performing local operations on the nodes. We
propose a family of such quantum operations that decrease the entanglement
percolation threshold of the network and increase the size of the giant
connected component. We provide analytic results for complex networks with
arbitrary (uncorrelated) degree distribution. These results are in good
agreement with numerical simulations, which also show enhancement in correlated
and real world networks. The proposed quantum preprocessing strategies are not
robust in the presence of noise. However, even when the links consist of
(noisy) mixed state links, one can send quantum information through a
connecting path with a fidelity that decreases with the path length. In this
noisy scenario, complex networks offer a clear advantage over regular lattices,
namely the fact that two arbitrary nodes can be connected through a relatively
small number of steps, known as the small world effect. We calculate the
probability that two arbitrary nodes in the network can successfully
communicate with a fidelity above a given threshold. This amounts to working
out the classical problem of percolation with limited path length. We find that
this probability can be significant even for paths limited to few connections,
and that the results for standard (unlimited) percolation are soon recovered if
the path length exceeds by a finite amount the average path length, which in
complex networks generally scales logarithmically with the size of the network.

$\ZZ/2\ZZ$, the corresponding family of Lattes maps are Belyi morphisms if and
only if the isogeny is multiplication by two. This family form a continuous
family of Belyi maps. Elliptic curves with complex multiplication also
determine a family over $\ZZ$ of Belyi morphisms. We give the explicit formulas
for the first few Belyi morphisms when the curve has complex multiplication by
3rd root of unity.

gap equation recent lattice results for the gluon and ghost propagators. The
Ansatz employed for the quark-gluon vertex is purely non-Abelian, introducing a
crucial dependence on the ghost dressing function and the quark-ghost
scattering amplitude. The numerical impact of these quantities is considerable:
the need to invoke confinement explicitly is avoided, and the dynamical quark
masses generated are of the order of 300 MeV. In addition, the pion decay
constant and the quark condensate are computed, and are found to be in good
agreement with phenomenology.

long-standing problem in nonlinear physics. The onset of entrainment in
populations of large but finite size exhibits strong sensitivity to
fluctuations in the oscillator density at the synchronizing frequency. This is
the source for the unusual values assumed by the correlation size exponent
$\nu'$. Locally coupled oscillators on a $d$-dimensional lattice exhibit two
types of frequency entrainment: symmetry-breaking at $d > 4$, and aggregation
of compact synchronized domains in three and four dimensions. Various critical
properties of the transition are well captured by finite-size scaling relations
with simple yet unconventional exponent values.

EOT appears not only for screens perforated by holes or slits, but also for
screens loaded by any defects, including opaque defects. These results widen
the scope of EOT concept, opening up the way to the study of new physical
effects.

Heavisidian monopoles in gravitational interactions, a unified theory of
gravi-electromagnetism has been developed on generalizing the
Schwinger-Zwanziger formulation of dyon to quaternion in simple and consistent
manner. Starting with the four Lorentz like forces on different charges, we
have generalized the Schwinger-Zwanziger quantization parameters in order to
obtain the angular momentum for unified fields of dyons and gravito-dyons (i.e.
Gravi-electromagnetism). Taking the unified charge as quaternion, we have
reformulated manifestly covariant and consistent theory for the dynamics of
four charges namely electric, magnetic, gravitational and Heavisidian
associated with gravi electromagnetism.
