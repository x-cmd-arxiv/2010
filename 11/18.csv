quotes a private communication by Jorge Ize claiming that any bifurcation

steady states. The proof should come from the fact that any absolutely
irreducible representation possesses an odd dimensional fixed point space.
  In this paper we show that there are many examples of groups which have
absolutely irreducible representations but no odd dimensional fixed point
space. This observation may be relevant also for some degree theoretic
considerations concerning equivariant bifurcation. Moreover we show that our
examples give rise to some interesting Hamiltonian dynamics and we show that
despite some complications we can go a long way towards doing explicit

samples of ""projected"" mass and orbital radius, respectively. We present a new
method for estimating the probability density distribution (density) of the
unprojected quantity from such samples. For a sample of n data values, the
method involves solving n simultaneous linear equations to determine the
weights of delta functions for the raw, unsmoothed density of the unprojected
quantity that cause the associated cumulative distribution function (CDF) of
the projected quantity to exactly reproduce the empirical CDF of the sample at
the locations of the n data values. We smooth the raw density using
nonparametric kernel density estimation with a normal kernel of bandwidth
\sigma. We calibrate the dependence of \sigma on n by Monte Carlo experiments
performed on samples drawn from a theoretical density, in which the integrated
square error is minimized. We scale this calibration to the ranges of real RV
samples using the Normal Reference Rule. The resolution and amplitude accuracy
of the estimated density improve with n. For typical RV and ML samples, we
expect the fractional noise at the PDF peak to be approximately 80 n^{-\log 2}.
For illustrations, we apply the new method to 67 RV values given a similar
treatment by Jorissen et al. in 2001, and to the 308 RV values listed at

by N=2 supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics with gauge group SU(2) x U(1) and
N_f=2 matter hypermultiplets, perturbed by a Fayet-Iliopoulos term which breaks
the supersymmetry down to N=0 on a metastable vacuum. In the hidden sector the
Kahler potential is renormalized. Upon identifying a hidden sector modulus with
the renormalization scale, and extrapolating to the strongly coupled regime
using the Seiberg-Witten solution, the contribution from the hidden sector to
the MSSM renormalization group flows is computed. For concreteness, we consider
a model in which the renormalization effects are communicated to the MSSM
sector via gauge mediation. In contrast to the perturbative toy examples of
hidden sector renormalization studied in the literature, we find that our
strongly coupled model exhibits rather intricate effects on the MSSM soft
scalar mass spectrum, depending on how the hidden sector fields are coupled to
the messenger fields. This model provides a concrete example in which the
low-energy spectrum of MSSM particles that are expected to be accessible in
collider experiments is obtained using strongly coupled hidden sector dynamics.

destroys molecules within the pristine gas, and only the polluted material,

the cosmological linear-perturbation theory lead to supersonic coherent
baryonic flows just after recombination (i.e. z~1020), with rms velocities of
~30 km/s relative to the underlying dark-matter distribution, on comoving
scales of ~<3 Mpc/h. To study the impact of these coherent flows we performed
high-resolution N-body plus SPH simulations in boxes of 5.0 and 0.7 Mpc/h, for
bulk-flow velocities of 0 (as reference), 30 and 60 km/s. The simulations
follow the evolution of cosmic structures by taking into account detailed,
primordial, non-equilibrium gas chemistry (i.e. H, He, H2, HD, HeH, etc.),
cooling, star formation, and feedback effects from stellar evolution. We find
that these bulk flows suppress star formation in low-mass haloes (i.e.
Mvir<~10^8Msun until z~13, lower the abundance of the first objects by ~1%-20%,
and, as consequence, delay cosmic star formation history by ~2e7yr. The gas
fractions in individual objects can change up to a factor of two at very early
times. Coherent bulk flow, therefore, has implications for (i) the
star-formation in the lowest-mass haloes (e.g. dSphs), (ii) the start of
reionization by suppressing it in some patches of the Universe, and (iii) the
heating (i.e. spin temperature) of neutral hydrogen. We speculate that the
patchy nature of reionization and heating on several Mpc scales could lead to

objects, located in the North America/Pelican Nebula Complex, was announced.
Early observations indicated that these objects may belong to the FUor or EXor
class of young eruptive stars. The eruptions of FUors and EXors are often
explained by enhanced accretion of material from the circumstellar disk to the
protostar. Aims. In order to determine the true nature of these two objects, we
started an optical and near-infrared monitoring program, and complemented our
data with archival observations and data from the literature. Methods. We plot
and analyze pre-outburst and outburst spectral energy distributions (SEDs),
multi-filter light curves, and color-color diagrams. Results. HBC 722
brightened monotonically in about two months, and the SED obtained during
maximum brightness indicates the appearance of a hot, single-temperature
blackbody. The current fading rate implies that the star will return to
quiescence in about a year, questioning its classification as a bone fide FUor.
The outburst of VSX J205126.1+440523 happened more gradually, but reached an
unprecedentedly high amplitude. At 2.5 months after the peak, its light curves
show a deep minimum, when the object was close to its pre-outburst optical
brightness. Further monitoring indicates that it is still far from being
quiescent. Conclusions. The shape of the light curves, the bolometric
luminosities and accretion rates suggest that these objects do not fit into the
classic FUor group. Although HBC 722 exhibit all spectral characteristics of a
bona fide FUor, its luminosity and accretion rate is too low, and its timescale
is too fast compared to classical FUors. VSX J205126.1+440523 seems to be an
example where quick extinction changes modulate the light curve.

with stellar background. This increase of eccentricity reduces the merging
timescale of the binary through the gravitational radiation to the value well
below the Hubble Time. It also gives the theoretical explanation of the
existence of eccentric binary such as that in OJ287 \citep{lehto96,
valtonen08}. In self-consistent N-body simulations, this increase of
eccentricity is always observed. On the other hand, the result of scattering
experiment between SMBH binaries and field stars \citep{quinlan96} indicated no
increase of eccentricity. This discrepancy leaves the high eccentricity of the
SMBH binaries in $N$-body simulations unexplained. Here we present a
stellar-dynamical mechanism that drives the increase of the eccentricity of an
SMBH binary with large mass ratio. There are two key processes involved. The
first one is the Kozai mechanism under non-axisymmetric potential, which
effectively randomizes the angular momenta of surrounding stars. The other is
the selective ejection of stars with prograde orbits. Through these two
mechanisms, field stars extract the orbital angular momentum of the SMBH
binary. Our proposed mechanism causes the increase in the eccentricity of most
of SMBH binaries, resulting in the rapid merger through gravitational wave
radiation. Our result has given a definite solution to the ""last-parsec

semi-coherent large scale motions in which turbulence plays only a smaller
diffusive role that enables magnetic flux linkage.

a prescribed non-equilibrium static structure factor S_0(k; {\phi}). The
evolution of the {\alpha}- relaxation time {\tau}{\alpha} (k) and long-time

monitored for an array of volume fractions. For a given waiting time the plot
of {\tau}{\alpha} (k; {\phi}, tw) as a function of {\phi} exhibits two regimes
corresponding to samples that have fully equilibrated within this waiting time
({\phi} \leq {\phi}(c) (tw)), and to samples for which equilibration is not yet
complete ({\phi} \geq {\phi}(c) (tw)). The crossover volume fraction {\phi}(c)
(tw) increases with tw but seems to saturate to a value {\phi}(a) \equiv
{\phi}(c) (tw \rightarrow \infty) \approx 0.582. We also find that the waiting

strongly as {\phi} approaches {\phi}^(a), thus suggesting that the measurement

Pauli particles can be described entirely from within a Clifford algebra taken
over the reals. There is no need to appeal to any `wave function'. To describe
a quantum system, we define the Clifford density element [CDE] as a product of
an element of a minimal left ideal and its Clifford conjugate. The properties
of the system are then completely specified in terms of bilinear invariants of
the first and second kind calculated using the CDE. Thus the quantum properties
of a system can be completely described from within the algebra without the
need to appeal to any Hilbert space representation.
  Furthermore we show that the essential bilinear invariants of the second kind
are simply the Bohm energy and the Bohm momentum, entities that make their
appearance in the Bohm interpretation. We also show how these parameters emerge
from standard quantum field theory in the low energy, single particle
approximation. There is no need to appeal to classical mechanics at any stage.
This clearly shows that the Bohm approach is entirely within the standard
quantum formalism. The method has enabled us to lay the foundations of an
approach that can be extended to provide a complete relativistic version of
Bohm model. In this paper we confine our attention to the details of the
non-relativistic case and will present its relativistic extension in a

common perception that it is not possible to construct a fully relativistic

version by using an approach based on Clifford algebras outlined in two earlier
papers by Hiley and by Hiley and Callaghan. The relativistic model is different
from the one originally proposed by Bohm and Hiley and by Doran and Lasenby. We
obtain exact expressions for the Bohm energy-momentum density, a relativistic
quantum Hamilton-Jacobi for the conservation of energy which includes an
expression for the quantum potential and a relativistic time development
equation for the spin vectors of the particle. We then show that these reduce
to the corresponding non-relativistic expressions for the Pauli particle which
have already been derived by Bohm, Schiller and Tiomno and in more general form
by Hiley and Callaghan. In contrast to the original presentations, there is no
need to appeal to classical mechanics at any stage of the development of the
formalism. All the results for the Dirac, Pauli and Schroedinger cases are
shown to emerge respectively from the hierarchy of Clifford algebras
C(13),C(30), C(01) taken over the reals as Hestenes has already argued. Thus
quantum mechanics is emerging from one mathematical structure with no need to

(eruptive) flares. A deeper study of this scenario reveals, however, a number
of open issues. Among them is the fundamental question, how the magnetic energy
is transferred from large, accumulation scales to plasma scales where its
actual dissipation takes place. In order to investigate this transfer over a
broad range of scales we address this question by means of a high-resolution
MHD simulation. The simulation results indicate that the magnetic-energy
transfer to small scales is realized via a cascade of consecutive smaller and
smaller flux-ropes (plasmoids), in analogy with the vortex-tube cascade in
(incompressible) fluid dynamics. Both tearing and (driven) ""fragmenting
coalescence"" processes are equally important for the consecutive fragmentation
of the magnetic field (and associated current density) to smaller elements. At
the later stages a dynamic balance between tearing and coalescence processes
reveals a steady (power-law) scaling typical for cascading processes. It is
shown that cascading reconnection also addresses other open issues in solar
flare research such as the duality between the regular large-scale picture of
(eruptive) flares and the observed signatures of fragmented (chaotic) energy
release, as well as the huge number of accelerated particles. Indeed,
spontaneous current-layer fragmentation and formation of multiple channelised
dissipative/acceleration regions embedded in the current layer appears to be
intrinsic to the cascading process. The multiple small-scale current sheets may
also facilitate the acceleration of a large number of particles. The structure,
distribution and dynamics of the embedded potential acceleration regions in a
current layer fragmented by cascading reconnection are studied and discussed.

below the Central Andes during Eocene-Oligocene times, and below Peru and
North-Central Chile since Pliocene, resulted (1) in the shortening of the
continental plate interiors at a large distance from the trench, (2) in
stronger interplate coupling and ultimately, (3) in a decrease of the

may thus explain the diminution of the convergence velocity between the Nazca

on slab dynamics. Oceanic ridges parallel to the trench have a stronger effect
on the process of subduction because they simultaneously affect a longer trench
segment. Large buoyant slab segments sink more slowly into the asthenosphere,
and their subduction result in a diminution of the velocity of subduction of
the plate. We observe a steeping of the slab below those buoyant anomalies,
resulting in smaller radius of curvature of the slab, that augments the energy
dissipated in folding the plate and further diminishes the velocity of
subduction. When the 3D geometry of a buoyant plateau is modelled, the dip of
the slab above the plateau decreases, as a result of the larger velocity of
subduction of the dense ""normal"" oceanic plate on both sides of the plateau.
Such a perturbation of the dip of the slab maintains long time after the
plateau has been entirely incorporated into the subduction zone. We compare
experiments with the present-day subduction zone below South America.
Experiments suggest that a modest ridge perpendicular to the trench such as the
present-day Juan Fernandez ridge is not buoyant enough to modify the slab
geometry. Already subducted buoyant anomalies within the oceanic plate, in
contrast, may be responsible for some aspects of the present-day geometry of
the Nazca slab at depth.

explicitly two issues in singularly perturbed stationary diffusion processes
arisen from nonlinear differential equations: (1) For a process whose
corresponding ordinary differential equation has a stable limit cycle, the
stationary solution exhibits a clear separation of time scales: an exponential
terms and an algebraic prefactor. The large deviation rate function attains its
minimum zero on the entire stable limit cycle, while the leading term of the
prefactor is inversely proportional to the velocity of the non-uniform periodic
oscillation on the cycle. (2) For dynamics with multiple stable fixed points
and saddles, there is in general a breakdown of detailed balance among the
corresponding attractors. Two landscapes, a local and a global, arise in LDT,
and a Markov jumping process with cycle flux emerges in the low-noise limit. A
local landscape is pertinent to the transition rates between neighboring stable
fixed points; and the global landscape defines a nonequilibrium steady state.
There would be nondifferentiable points in the latter for a stationary dynamics
with cycle flux. LDT serving as the mathematical foundation for emergent

electron systems in external magnetic field using the AdS/CFT correspondence.
The gravity dual of a finite density fermion system is a Dirac field in the
background of the dyonic AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. In the probe limit
the magnetic system can be reduced to the non-magnetic one, with
Landau-quantized momenta and rescaled thermodynamical variables. We find that
at strong enough magnetic fields, the Fermi surface vanishes and the
quasiparticle is lost either through a crossover to conformal regime or through
a phase transition to an unstable Fermi surface. In the latter case, the
vanishing Fermi velocity at the critical magnetic field triggers the non-Fermi
liquid regime with unstable quasiparticles and a change in transport properties
of the system. We associate it with a metal-""strange metal"" phase transition.
Next we compute the DC Hall and longitudinal conductivities using the
gravity-dressed fermion propagators. For dual fermions with a large charge,
many different Fermi surfaces contribute and the Hall conductivity is quantized
as expected for integer Quantum Hall Effect (QHE). At strong magnetic fields,
as additional Fermi surfaces open up, new plateaus typical for the fractional
QHE appear. The somewhat irregular pattern in the length of fractional QHE
plateaus resemble the outcomes of experiments on thin graphite in a strong
magnetic field. Finally, motivated by the absence of the sign problem in
holography, we suggest a lattice approach to the AdS calculations of finite
density systems.

which, when at a vertex v with d(v) offspring, moves closer to the root with
probability lambda/[lambda+d(v)], and to each of the offspring with probability
1/[lambda+d(v)]. This walk is recurrent for lambda>=rho and transient for
0<lambda<rho, with rho the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue for the (assumed)
irreducible matrix of expected offspring numbers. Subject to finite moments of
order p>4 for the offspring distributions, we prove the following quenched CLT
for lambda-biased random walk at the critical value lambda=rho: for almost
every T, the process |X_{floor(nt)}|/sqrt{n} converges in law as n tends to
infinity to a reflected Brownian motion rescaled by an explicit constant. This
result was proved under some stronger assumptions by Peres-Zeitouni (2008) for
single-type Galton-Watson trees. Following their approach, our proof is based
on a new explicit description of a reversing measure for the walk from the
point of view of the particle (generalizing the measure constructed in the
single-type setting by Peres-Zeitouni), and the construction of appropriate
harmonic coordinates. In carrying out this program we prove moment and
conductance estimates for MGW trees, which may be of independent interest. In
addition, we extend our construction of the reversing measure to a biased
random walk with random environment (RWRE) on MGW trees, again at a critical
value of the bias. We compare this result against a transience-recurrence
criterion for the RWRE generalizing a result of Faraud (2011) for Galton-Watson

local amplitude and phase structure in images, we focus on the case of two

model learns subspaces resembling quadrature-pair Gabor filters. We then
introduce an additional set of hidden units that model the dependencies among

gamma-ray burst (LGRB) host galaxies. Recent studies suggest that the M-Z
relation for local LGRB host galaxies may be systematically offset towards
lower metallicities relative to the M-Z relation defined by the general star
forming galaxy (SDSS) population. The nature of this offset is consistent with
suggestions that low metallicity environments may be required to produce high
mass progenitors, although the detection of several GRBs in high-mass,
high-metallicity galaxies challenges the notion of a strict metallicity cut-off
for host galaxies that are capable of producing GRBs. We show that the nature
of this reported offset may be explained by a recently proposed
anti-correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the metallicity of
star forming galaxies. If low metallicity galaxies produce more stars than
their equally massive, high-metallicity counterparts, then transient events
that closely trace the SFR in a galaxy would be more likely to be found in
these low metallicity, low mass galaxies. Therefore, the offset between the GRB
and SDSS defined M-Z relations may be the result of the different methods used
to select their respective galaxy populations, with GRBs being biased towards
low metallicity, high SFR, galaxies. We predict that such an offset should not
be expected of transient events that do not closely follow the star formation
history of their host galaxies, such as short duration GRBs and SN Ia, but
should be evident in core collapse SNe found through upcoming untargeted
surveys.

time interval of a few days leading to the detection of the flaring episode. We
then constructed two spectral datasets, one corresponding to the flare interval
(March/April 2007) and another to the normal quiescent state of the source. The
X-ray light curve of the Arches cluster shows, with high significance (8.6

short-term duration of the flare is constrained to be longer than four days.
The temperature and the line-of-sight column density inferred from the flare
spectrum do not differ from those measured in the normal activity state of the
cluster, suggesting that the flux enhancement is thermal in origin. We
attribute the X-ray variability to in situ stellar activity: early-type stars

that one determine where the transition from the atomic to molecular gas

cosmological simulations where the internal structures of molecular clouds are
unresolved: a complex time-dependent chemistry network coupled to a radiative
transfer calculation of the dissociating ultraviolet (UV) radiation field, and
a simple time-independent analytic approximation. We show that these two
methods produce excellent agreement at all metallicities >~10^-2 of the Milky
Way value across a very wide range of UV fields. At lower metallicities the
agreement is worse, likely because time-dependent effects become important;
however, there are no observational calibrations of molecular gas content at
such low metallicities, so it is unclear if either method is accurate. The
comparison suggests that, in many but not all applications, the analytic
approximation provides a viable and nearly cost-free alternative to full
time-dependent chemistry and radiative transfer.

irradiated planet is contrary to the idea that highly irradiated planets are
expected to have inversions, perhaps due the presence of an unknown absorber in
the upper atmosphere. This result might be explained by the modestly enhanced
activity level of WASP-4b's G7V host star, which could increase the amount of
UV flux received by the planet, therefore reducing the abundance of the unknown
stratospheric absorber in the planetary atmosphere as suggested in Knutson et
al. (2010). We also find no evidence for an offset in the timing of the
secondary eclipse and place a 2 sigma upper limit on |ecos(omega)| of 0.0024,
which constrains the range of tidal heating models that could explain this
planet's inflated radius.

precise and reliable photometric redshifts up to z=2 by supplementing the
optical survey COMBO-17 with observations in four near-infrared bands on 0.2
square degrees of the COMBO-17 A901-field. Our results are based on an
H-band-selected catalogue of 10692 galaxies complete to H=21.7. We measure the
rest-frame colour (U_280-V) of each galaxy, which across the redshift range of
our interest requires no extrapolation and is robust against moderate redshift
errors by staying clear of the 4000A-break. We measure the colour-magnitude
relation of the red sequence as a function of lookback time from the peak in a
colour error-weighted histogram, and thus trace the galaxy bimodality out to
z~1.65. The (U_280-V) of the red sequence is found to evolve almost linearly
with lookback time. At high redshift, we find massive galaxies in both the red

in mass density by a factor of ~4 from z~2 to 1 and remain nearly constant at
z<1. However, some galaxies as massive as log M_*/M_sun=11.5 are already in

  We develop an algorithm based on Supervised Random Walks that naturally
combines the information from the network structure with node and edge level
attributes. We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on
the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a
function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random
walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in
the future. We develop an efficient training algorithm to directly learn the

brighter than the z=8.56 galaxy UDFy-38135539. They thus represent ideal

wide range of line strength. Line bisectors exhibit the characteristic C-shape
signature of surface convection (granulation) and they span from about 100 m/s

shifts range from about -100 to -900 m/s, depending on line strength. In
general, larger blueshifts are observed in weaker lines, but there is
increasing scatter with increasing residual flux. Assuming local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE), we synthesize the same set of spectral lines using a
state-of-the-art three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation for a stellar
atmosphere of fundamental parameters similar to those of HD122563. We find good
agreement between model predictions and observations. This allows us to infer
an absolute zero-point for the line shifts and radial velocity. Moreover, it

be magnetars: neutron stars powered by extreme magnetic fields. These rare
objects are characterized by repeated and sometimes spectacular gamma-ray
bursts. The burst mechanism might involve crustal fractures and excitation of
non-radial modes which would emit gravitational waves (GWs). We present the
results of a search for GW bursts from six galactic magnetars that is sensitive
to neutron star f-modes, thought to be the most efficient GW emitting
oscillatory modes in compact stars. One of them, SGR 0501+4516, is likely ~1
kpc from Earth, an order of magnitude closer than magnetars targeted in
previous GW searches. A second, AXP 1E 1547.0-5408, gave a burst with an
estimated isotropic energy >10^{44} erg which is comparable to the giant
flares. We find no evidence of GWs associated with a sample of 1279
electromagnetic triggers from six magnetars occurring between November 2006 and
June 2009, in GW data from the LIGO, Virgo, and GEO600 detectors. Our lowest
model-dependent GW emission energy upper limits for band- and time-limited
white noise bursts in the detector sensitive band, and for f-mode ringdowns (at
1090 Hz), are 3.0x10^{44} d_1^2 erg and 1.4x10^{47} d_1^2 erg respectively,
where d_1 = d_{0501} / 1 kpc and d_{0501} is the distance to SGR 0501+4516.
These limits on GW emission from f-modes are an order of magnitude lower than
any previous, and approach the range of electromagnetic energies seen in SGR
giant flares for the first time.

fundamental insights into mechanisms that determine ecosystem stability and
persistence. Despite long-standing interest in the compartmental structure of
food webs, past network analyses of food webs have been constrained by a
standard definition of compartments, or modules, that requires many links
within compartments and few links between them. Empirical analyses have been
further limited by low-resolution data for primary producers. In this paper, we
present a Bayesian computational method for identifying group structure in food
webs using a flexible definition of a group that can describe both functional
roles and standard compartments. The Serengeti ecosystem provides an
opportunity to examine structure in a newly compiled food web that includes
species-level resolution among plants, allowing us to address whether groups in
the food web correspond to tightly-connected compartments or functional groups,
and whether network structure reflects spatial or trophic organization, or a
combination of the two. We have compiled the major mammalian and plant
components of the Serengeti food web from published literature, and we infer
its group structure using our method. We find that network structure
corresponds to spatially distinct plant groups coupled at higher trophic levels
by groups of herbivores, which are in turn coupled by carnivore groups. Thus
the group structure of the Serengeti web represents a mixture of trophic guild
structure and spatial patterns, in contrast to the standard compartments
typically identified in ecological networks. From data consisting only of nodes
and links, the group structure that emerges supports recent ideas on spatial
coupling and energy channels in ecosystems that have been proposed as important
for persistence.

method is based on growing single-layer or few-layer graphene films from a

specified temperature and then allowing the dissolved carbon to nucleate and
grow on top of the melt at a lower temperature. The examined metals for the
metal - carbon melts included copper and nickel. For the latter, pristine
single layer graphene was grown successfully. The resulting graphene layers
were subjected to detailed microscopic and Raman spectroscopic
characterization. The deconvolution of the Raman 2D band was used to accurately
determine the number of atomic planes in the resulting graphene layers and
access their quality. The results indicate that our technology can provide bulk
graphite films, few-layer graphene as well as high-quality single layer

oxides, most notably LaAlO3 and SrTiO3. Properties of this two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG) have attracted significant interest due to its potential
applications in nanoelectronics. Control over this carrier density and mobility
of the 2DEG is essential for applications of these novel systems, and may be
achieved by epitaxial strain. However, despite the rich nature of strain
effects on oxide materials properties, such as ferroelectricity, magnetism, and
superconductivity, the relationship between the strain and electrical
properties of the 2DEG at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface remains largely
unexplored. Here, we use different lattice constant single crystal substrates
to produce LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces with controlled levels of biaxial epitaxial
strain. We have found that tensile strained SrTiO3 destroys the conducting
2DEG, while compressively strained SrTiO3 retains the 2DEG, but with a carrier
concentration reduced in comparison to the unstrained LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface.
We have also found that the critical LaAlO3 overlayer thickness for 2DEG
formation increases with SrTiO3 compressive strain. Our first-principles
calculations suggest that a strain-induced electric polarization in the SrTiO3
layer is responsible for this behavior. It is directed away from the interface
and hence creates a negative polarization charge opposing that of the polar
LaAlO3 layer. This both increases the critical thickness of the LaAlO3 layer,
and reduces carrier concentration above the critical thickness, in agreement
with our experimental results. Our findings suggest that epitaxial strain can
be used to tailor 2DEGs properties of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface.

of Population (Pop) III stars may have had masses low enough for them to
survive to the present day, we consider the role that the accretion of
metal-enriched gas may have had in altering their surface composition, thereby
disguising them as Pop II stars. We demonstrate that if weak, Solar-like winds
are launched from low-mass Pop III stars formed in the progenitors of the dark
matter halo of the Galaxy, then such stars are likely to avoid significant
enrichment via accretion of material from the interstellar medium. We find that
at early times accretion is easily prevented if the stars are ejected from the
central regions of the haloes in which they form, either by dynamical
interactions with more massive Pop III stars, or by violent relaxation during
halo mergers. While accretion may still take place during passage through
sufficiently dense molecular clouds at later times, we find that the
probability of such a passage is generally low (< 0.1), assuming that stars
have velocities of order the maximum circular velocity of their host haloes and
accounting for the orbital decay of merging haloes. In turn, due to the higher
gas density required for accretion onto stars with higher velocities, we find
an even lower probability of accretion (~ 0.01) for the subset of Pop III stars
formed at z > 10, which are more quickly incorporated into massive haloes than
stars formed at lower redshift. While there is no a priori reason to assume
that low-mass Pop III stars do not have Solar-like winds, without them surface
enrichment via accretion is likely to be inevitable. We briefly discuss the
implications that our results hold for stellar archaeology.

the detection of a velocity gradient of disc stars in the fourth quadrant,
directed radially from the Galactic centre. In the direction of the Galactic
centre, we apply a simple method independent of stellar proper motions and of
Galactic parameters to assess the existence of this gradient in the RAVE data.
This velocity gradient corresponds to |K+C| < 3 km/s/kpc, where K and C are the
Oort constants measuring the local divergence and radial shear of the velocity
field, respectively. In order to illustrate the effect, assuming a zero radial
velocity of the Local Standard of Rest we then reconstruct the two-dimensional
Galactocentric velocity maps using two different sets of proper motions and
photometric distances based either on isochrone fitting or on K-band

of ""Quasi-Normal Modes (QNM). The following thesis is inspired by the QNM
theory, recently developed for homogeneous cavity open just on one side. It is
stressed that any 1D-PBG is an open cavity on both sides which allows the
confinement of the e.m. field, but that causes radiation losses; the em field
initially present within it, on the passing of time, can only propagate
outwards. In general, the 1D-PBG is not a conservative system and the natural
evolution of the e.m. field can not be described by a Hermitian operator: in
short, a discussion in terms of normal modes of the field radiation is
abandoned. The method of QNM uses, as tools of analysis, the Green's function
and biorthogonal spaces. The 1D-PBG is studied in a more realistic way : a
finite structure, immersed in an unlimited space. The renunciation of energy
conservation for the system under consideration has important consequences,
both numerical and conceptual: it goes from real autofrequencies to complex
quasi-autofrequencies. Moreover, as the operator describing the evolution of
space-time is not hermitian, the modes are no longer normal, but quasi-normal:
in fact, only under appropriate conditions, they not only provide a basis
orthogonal, but their space-time evolution is similar to that of the Hermitian
normal modes.

the singular value decomposition (SVD). The purpose of this paper is twofold.
The first is to give an explanation on how and why the singular vectors can be
used in clustering. And the second is to show that the two seemingly unrelated
SVD aspects actually originate from the same source: related vertices tend to
be more clustered in the graph representation of lower rank approximate matrix
using the SVD than in the original semantic graph. Accordingly, the SVD can
improve retrieval performance of an information retrieval system since queries
made to the approximate matrix can retrieve more relevant documents and filter
out more irrelevant documents than the same queries made to the original
matrix. By utilizing this fact, we will devise an LSI algorithm that mimicks
SVD capability in clustering related vertices. Convergence analysis shows that
the algorithm is convergent and produces a unique solution for each input.
Experimental results using some standard datasets in LSI research show that
retrieval performances of the algorithm are comparable to the SVD's. In
addition, the algorithm is more practical and easier to use because there is no
need to determine decomposition rank which is crucial in driving retrieval
performance of the SVD.

control points where many lines are incident, we create a cell decompostion
using the polynomial ham sandwich theorem. This creates a dichotomy: either
most of the points are in the interiors of the cells, in which case we
immediately get sharp results, or alternatively the points lie on the walls of
the cells, in which case they are in the zero set of a polynomial of
suprisingly low degree, and we may apply the algebraic method. In order to
control points where only two lines are incident, we use the flecnode
polynomial of the Rev. George Salmon to conclude that most of the lines lie on
a ruled surface. Then we use the geometry of ruled surfaces to complete the
proof.

typically introduces a long-range scalar force that needs to be screened on
small scales. One common screening mechanism is the chameleon, where the scalar
force is screened in environments with a sufficiently deep gravitational
potential, but acts unimpeded in regions with a shallow gravitational
potential. This leads to a variation in the overall gravitational G with
environment. We show such a variation can occur within a star itself,
significantly affecting its evolution and structure, provided that the host
galaxy is unscreened. The effect is most pronounced for red giants, which would
be smaller by a factor of tens of percent and thus hotter by 100's of K,
depending on the parameters of the underlying scalar-tensor theory. Careful
measurements of these stars in suitable environments (nearby dwarf galaxies not
associated with groups or clusters) would provide constraints on the chameleon
mechanism that are four orders of magnitude better than current large scale
structure limits, and two orders of magnitude better than present solar system
tests.

but the short penetration length of an undersaturated solution made it seem
impossible for long conduits to develop. This is contradicted by field
observations, where extended conduits, sometimes several kilometers long, are
found in karst environments. However, a sharp drop in the dissolution rate of
CaCO_3 near saturation provides a mechanism for much deeper penetration of
reactant. The notion of a ""kinetic trigger"" - a sudden change in rate constant
over a narrow concentration range - has become a widely accepted paradigm in
speleogenesis modeling. However, it is based on one-dimensional models for the
fluid and solute transport inside the fracture, assuming that the dissolution
front is planar in the direction perpendicular to the flow. Here we show that
this assumption is incorrect; a planar dissolution front in an entirely uniform
fracture is unstable to infinitesimal perturbations and inevitably breaks up
into highly localized regions of dissolution. This provides an alternative
mechanism for cave formation, even in the absence of a kinetic trigger. Our
results suggest that there is an inherent wavelength to the erosion pattern in
dissolving fractures, which depends on the reaction rate and flow rate, but is

the problem, formulated by J-L. Loday in \cite{LodayEns}, is that of finding a
generalization of the Lie's third theorem for Leibniz algebra. That is, we
search a manifold provided with an algebraic structure which generalizes the
structure of a (local) Lie group, and such that the tangent space at a
distinguished point is a Leibniz algebra structure. Moreover, when the Leibniz
algebra is a Lie algebra, we want that the integrating manifold is a Lie group.
In his article \cite{Kinyon}, M.K. Kinyon solves the particular case of split
Leibniz algebras. He shows, in particular, that the tangent space at the
neutral element of a Lie rack is provided with a Leibniz algebra structure.
Hence it seemed reasonable to think that Lie racks give a solution to the
coquecigrue problem, but M.K. Kinyon also showed that a Lie algebra can be
integrated into a Lie rack which is not a Lie group. Therefore, we have to
specify inside the category of Lie racks, which objects are the coquecigrues.
In this article we give a local solution to this problem. We show that every
Leibniz algebra becomes integrated into a \textit{local augmented Lie rack}.
The proof is inspired by E. Cartan's proof of Lie's third theorem, and, viewing
a Leibniz algebra as a central extension by some center, proceeds by
integrating explicitely the corresponding Leibniz 2-cocycle into a rack
2-cocycle. This proof gives us a way to construct local augmented Lie racks
which integrate Leibniz algebras, and this article ends with examples of the
integration of non split Leibniz algebras in dimension 4 and 5.

  reviews",,,,"math.CT cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  String diagrams are a powerful tool for reasoning about physical processes,
logic circuits, tensor networks, and many other compositional structures. The
distinguishing feature of these diagrams is that edges need not be connected to
vertices at both ends, and these unconnected ends can be interpreted as the
inputs and outputs of a diagram. In this paper, we give a concrete construction
for string diagrams using a special kind of typed graph called an open-graph.
While the category of open-graphs is not itself adhesive, we introduce the
notion of a selective adhesive functor, and show that such a functor embeds the
category of open-graphs into the ambient adhesive category of typed graphs.
Using this functor, the category of open-graphs inherits ""enough adhesivity""
from the category of typed graphs to perform double-pushout (DPO) graph
rewriting. A salient feature of our theory is that it ensures rewrite systems
are ""type-safe"" in the sense that rewriting respects the inputs and outputs.
This formalism lets us safely encode the interesting structure of a
computational model, such as evaluation dynamics, with succinct, explicit
rewrite rules, while the graphical representation absorbs many of the tedious
details. Although topological formalisms exist for string diagrams, our
construction is discreet, finitary, and enjoys decidable algorithms for
composition and rewriting. We also show how open-graphs can be parametrised by
graphical signatures, similar to the monoidal signatures of Joyal and Street,
which define types for vertices in the diagrammatic language and constraints on
how they can be connected. Using typed open-graphs, we can construct free
symmetric monoidal categories, PROPs, and more general monoidal theories. Thus
open-graphs give us a handle for mechanised reasoning in monoidal categories.

a gravitational singularity without an event horizon. Penrose has proposed a
conjecture, according to which there exists a cosmic censor who forbids the
occurrence of naked singularities. Distinguishing between astrophysical black
holes and naked singularities is a major challenge for present day
observational astronomy. A possibility of differentiating naked singularities
from black holes is through the comparative study of thin accretion disks
properties around rotating naked singularities and Kerr-type black holes,
respectively. In the present paper, we consider accretion disks around rotating
naked singularities, obtained as solutions of the field equations in the
Einstein-massless scalar field theory. A first major difference between
rotating naked singularities and Kerr black holes is in the frame dragging
effect, the angular velocity of a rotating naked singularity being inversely
proportional to its spin parameter. Due to the differences in the exterior
geometry, the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the disks are
different for these two classes of compact objects, consequently giving clear
observational signatures that could discriminate between black holes and naked
singularities. For specific values of the spin parameter and of the scalar
charge, the energy flux from the disk around a rotating naked singularity can
exceed by several orders of magnitude the flux from the disk of a Kerr black
hole. The conversion efficiency of the accreting mass into radiation by
rotating naked singularities is always higher than the conversion efficiency
for black holes. Thus, these observational signatures may provide the necessary
tools from clearly distinguishing rotating naked singularities from Kerr-type
black holes.

storage nodes needed to guarantee data integrity. The scheme gracefully adapts
the cost of successful data retrieval to the number of storage node failures.
Moreover, by leveraging the Welch-Berlekamp algorithm, it avoids unnecessary
computations. Compared to the state-of-the-art decoding scheme, the
implementation and evaluation results show that our progressive data retrieval
scheme has up to 35 times better computation performance for low Byzantine node

of the QSO luminosity function, exhibits surprisingly homogenous X-ray spectral
properties: a soft excess with an extremely smooth shape containing no obvious
discrete features, a hard power law above 2 keV, and a weak narrow/barely
resolved Fe K-alpha fluorescence line for the three high signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N) spectra. The soft excess can be well fitted with only a soft power law.
No signatures of warm or cold intrinsic absorbers are found. The Fe K-alpha
centroids and the line widths indicate emission from neutral Fe (E=6.4 keV)
originating from cold material from distances of only a few light days or
further out. The well-constrained equivalent widths (EW) of the neutral Fe
lines are higher than expected from the X-ray Baldwin effect which has been
only poorly constrained at very high luminosities. Taking into account our
individual EW measurements, we show that the X-ray Baldwin effect flattens

due to neurodegenerative disorder and dysfunction. This arises from alterations
in synaptic functioning of neurons leading to cognitive impairment and memory
loss. Recent experimental studies indicate that the amyloid beta (A beta)
protein, in its dimer and oligomer forms, affects the synaptic activity of
neurons in the early stages of AD. However, the precise mechanism underlying A
beta induced synaptic depression is still not clearly understood. In this
paper, we introduce an electrical model that provides a possible mechanism for
this. Our studies show that the competing effects of synaptic activity and the
indirect interaction mediated by A beta, can disrupt the synchrony among
neurons and severely affect the neuronal activity. This then leads to
sub-threshold activity or synaptic silencing. This is in agreement with the
reported disruption of cortical synaptic integration in the presence of A beta
in transgenic mice. We suggest that direct electrophysiological measurements of
A beta activity can establish its role in AD and the possible revival, proposed
in our model. The mechanism proposed here is quite general and could account
for the role of the relevant protein in other neuronal disorders also.

fit the rotation curves with the ""simple"" and ""standard"" interpolating

results. We also redetermine the value of a0, and find a median value very
close to the one determined in previous studies, a0 = (1.22 +- 0.33) x 10^{-8}

best independently determined value leads to excellent quality fits for 75% of
the sample. Among the three exceptions, two are also known to give relatively
poor fits also in Newtonian dynamics plus dark matter. The remaining case (NGC

might however be explained by the presence of non-circular motions, by a small
distance, or by a value of a0 at the lower end of our best-fit interval, 0.9 x

of a prototype of domain wall in the soft phase, the evolution as well as the
motion of the domain wall from the soft to the hard phase and finally, the
magnetic reversal of the hard phase. For small soft layer thickness Ls, the
three steps are reduced to one single step, where the magnetizations in the two
phases reverse simultaneously and the hysteresis loops are square with
nucleation as the coercivity mechanism. As Ls increases, both nucleation and
pinning fields decrease. In the meantime, the single-step reversal expands to a

root of the crystalline anisotropy of the hard phase. Further increase of Ls

spatially unresolved H-alpha line emission with FWHM>= 10,000 km s^-1 at the
position of the nucleus, suggesting their AGN are powered by supermassive black
holes with masses of few x 10^9 M_sun and accretion luminosities of a few
percent of the Eddington luminosity. In two galaxies we also detect the BLRs in
H-beta, suggesting relatively low extinction of A_V~1 mag, which agrees with
constraints from X-ray observations. By relating black hole and bulge mass, we
find a possible offset towards higher black-hole masses of at most ~0.6 dex
relative to nearby galaxies at a given host mass, although each individual
galaxy is within the scatter of the local relationship. If not entirely from
systematic effects, this would then suggest that the masses of the host
galaxies have increased by at most a factor ~4 since z~2 relative to the
black-hole masses, perhaps through accretion of satellite galaxies or because
of a time lag between star formation in the host galaxy and AGN fueling. We
also compare the radiative and mechanical energy output (from jets) of our
targets with predictions of recent models of ""synthesis"" or ""grand unified"" AGN
feedback, which postulate that AGN with similar radiative and mechanical energy
output rates to those found in our HzRGs may be nearing the end of their period

hydrates could exist in the martian permafrost, on the surface and in the
interior of Titan, as well as in other icy satellites. Clathrate hydrates
probably formed in a significant fraction of planetesimals in the solar system.
Thus, these crystalline solids may have been accreted in comets, in the forming
giant planets and in their surrounding satellite systems. In this work, we use
a statistical thermodynamic model to investigate the composition of clathrate
hydrates that may have formed in the primordial nebula. In our approach, we
consider the formation sequence of the different ices occurring during the
cooling of the nebula, a reasonable idealization of the process by which
volatiles are trapped in planetesimals. We then determine the fractional
occupancies of guests in each clathrate hydrate formed at given temperature.
The major ingredient of our model is the description of the guest-clathrate
hydrate interaction by a spherically averaged Kihara potential with a nominal
set of parameters, most of which being fitted on experimental equilibrium data.
Our model allows us to find that Kr, Ar and N$_2$ can be efficiently encaged in
clathrate hydrates formed at temperatures higher than $\sim$ 48.5 K in the
primitive nebula, instead of forming pure condensates below 30 K. However, we
find at the same time that the determination of the relative abundances of
guest species incorporated in these clathrate hydrates strongly depends on the
choice of the parameters of the Kihara potential and also on the adopted size
of cages. Indeed, testing different potential parameters, we have noted that
even minor dispersions between the different existing sets can lead to
non-negligible variations in the determination of the volatiles trapped in
clathrate hydrates formed in the primordial nebula.

both magnetometry and magneto-optic spectroscopy. Optical spectra, in the
energy range 1.5eV - 3.5eV, were taken in Faraday geometry in an applied
magnetic field and also at remanence. This yielded rich information on the
effects of strain on the spin ordering in these films. Epitaxial films of
GdMnO3 were grown on SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 substrates. The LaAlO3 was twinned and
so produced a highly strained film whereas the strain was less for the film
grown on SrTiO3. The Ne\'el temperatures and coercive fields were measured
using zero field data and hysteresis loops obtained using a SQUID magnetometer.
Optical absorption data agreed with earlier work on bulk materials. The two
well known features in the optical spectrum, the charge transfer transition
between Mn d states at ~2eV and the band edge transition from the oxygen p band
to the d states at ~3eV are observed in the magnetic circular dichroism;
however they behaved very differently both as a function of magnetic field and
temperature. This is interpreted in terms of the magnetic ordering of the Mn
spins.

destruction of subtle small-scale fractal structure of the set due to the

$\gamma$-ray emission above 100 MeV from the direction of the Crab Nebula

by the Fermi-LAT telescope. This emission does not show evidences of pulsations
with the Crab pulsar. It seems that it originates at the shock region created
as a result of the interaction of the pulsar wind with the nebula. We propose
that such variable $\gamma$-ray emission originate in the region behind the
shock when the electrons can be accelerated as a result of the reconnection of
the magnetic field compressed by the decelerating pulsar wind. The natural
consequence of such interpretation is the prediction that the Crab Nebula
$\gamma$-ray spectrum produced by electrons as a result of the inverse Compton
scattering of soft radiation to multi-TeV energies should also show synchronous
variability on the time scales as observed at GeV energies by the AGILE and
Fermi-LAT telescopes. We calculate how the end of the IC component of the Crab
Nebula $\gamma$-ray spectrum should look like during the quiescent and the
flare GeV $\gamma$-ray emission. We conclude that the variability of the

responsible for the differences between the spectral features reported by the

low temperature a strong current suppression is found around the electron-hole
symmetry point independent of the couplings, in agreement with previous
results. By means of a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation we are able to give an
intuitive explanation to this suppression in the low-energy regime. In the
general situation, numerical simulations are carried out using quantum rate
equations. The simulations allow for the prediction of how the suppression is
affected by the couplings, the charging energy, the position of the energy
levels, the applied bias, and the temperature. We find that away from
electron-hole symmetry, the parity of the couplings is essential for the
current suppression. It is also shown how broadening, interference, and a
finite interaction energy cause a shift of the current minimum away from
degeneracy. Finally we see how an increased population of the upper level leads
to current peaks on each side of the suppression line. At sufficiently high
bias we discover a coherence-induced population inversion.

the particle moves stochastically due to an interaction with the thermal bath.
This interaction fluctuates the particle's transverse momenta like the Brownian
motion in a heat bath. Because of this fluctuating motion, it has been
discussed that the accelerated charged particle emits extra radiation (the
Unruh radiation) in addition to the classical Larmor radiation, and experiments
are under planning to detect such radiation by using ultrahigh intensity lasers
constructed in near future. There are, however, counterarguments that the
radiation is canceled by an interference effect between the vacuum fluctuation
and the fluctuating motion. In fact, in the case of an internal detector where
the Heisenberg equation of motion can be solved exactly, there is no additional
radiation after the thermalization is completed. In this paper, we revisit the
issue in the case of an accelerated charged particle in the scalar-field analog
of QED. We prove the equipartition theorem of transverse momenta by
investigating a stochastic motion of the particle, and show that the Unruh
radiation is partially canceled by an interference effect.

elongated geometry, extending about 104 AU in the direction perpendicular to
the well-known HH 211 jet, and exhibits a velocity distribution consistent with
rotation along the major axis. Our VLA observations indicate that the envelope
is mostly in virial equilibrium. However, comparing our data with results from
previous studies it appears that the gas within approximately 0.005 pc of the
central protostar is undergoing dynamical collapse. The size of this collapsing
radius may constrain the amount of mass that can eventually infall into the
forming star. We also find that the envelope is mostly internally heated, most
probably by radiation from the central protostar. In addition, we detect
evidence of outflow-envelope interaction in the ammonia data. These include a
velocity gradient in the dense gas along the outflow axis and significant line
broadening that is spatially correlated with the jet and it might be the result
of outflow-induced turbulence in the envelope.

novel events, particularly given data distributed across multiple platforms in
a variety of formats and sources with variable and unknown reliability.
Biological systems have evolved solutions to distributed search and response
under uncertainty. Immune systems and ant colonies efficiently scale up
massively parallel search with automated response in highly dynamic
environments, and both do so using distributed coordination without centralized
control. These properties are relevant to ALife, where distributed, autonomous,
robust and adaptive control is needed to design robot swarms, mobile computing

Automated Response (Scalable RADAR) in biology. We discuss how biological RADAR
scales up efficiently, and then discuss in detail how modular search in the

changes by ~ 100 km/s while the H beta and HeI 4686 emission components vary by
about the same amount but with a different phasing. Assuming that the observed
velocity changes trace the motion of the mass-donor star and of the X-ray
source implies a mass of the accreting black hole in the range of 3 to 100 Msol
with a most probable value of ~ 10 to 20 Msol. We expect an orbital period in
the range of 20 to 40 days based on the low density of the supergiant star. P13
is likely in a short-lived, and thus rare high X-ray luminosity evolutionary
state associated with the ascension of the donor star onto the supergiant
stage.

finite subdigraphs, there is an automorphism g of the digraph with U^g=V. Here,
extending work of Lachlan on finite homogeneous digraphs, we classify finite
set-homogeneous digraphs, where we allow some pairs of vertices to have arcs in
both directions. Under the assumption that such pairs of vertices are not
allowed, we obtain initial results on countably infinite set-homogeneous
digraphs, classifying those which are not 2-homogeneous.

algebras. We prove in the pre-Lie context the analogue to Jacobson's theorem
for restricted Lie algebras. In particular, we prove that any dendriform
algebra over a field of positive characteristic is a restricted pre-Lie
algebra. Thus we obtain that Rota-Baxter algebras and quasitriangular algebras
are restricted pre-Lie algebras. Moreover, we prove that the free
$\Gamma(\calligra{preLie})$-algebra is a restricted pre-Lie algebra, where
$\calligra{preLie}$ denotes the pre-Lie operad. Finally, we define the notion
of restricted enveloping dendriform algebra and we construct a left adjoint
functor for the functor $(-)_{p-preLie}: Dend \rightarrow p-preLie$.

star clusters within the circumnuclear starburst region of M83, the closest
such example. We compare the observed spectra with semi-empirical models, which
are based on an empirical library of Galactic O and B stars observed with IUE,
and with theoretical models, which are based on a new theoretical UV library of
hot massive stars computed with WM-Basic. The models were generated with
Starburst99 for metallicities of Z=0.020 and Z=0.040, and for stellar IMFs with
upper mass limits of 10, 30, 50, and 100 M_sol. We estimate the ages and masses
of the clusters from the best fit model spectra, and find that the ages derived
from the semi-empirical and theoretical models agree within a factor of 1.2 on
average. A comparison of the spectroscopic age estimates with values derived
from HST/WFC3/UVIS multi-band photometry shows a similar level of agreement for
all but one cluster. The clusters have a range of ages from about 3 to 20 Myr,
and do not appear to have an age gradient along M83's starburst. Clusters with
strong P-Cygni profiles have masses of a few times 10^4 M_sol, seem to have
formed stars more massive than 30 M_sol, and are consistent with a Kroupa IMF
from 0.1-100 M_sol. Field regions in the starburst lack P-Cygni profiles and
are dominated by B stars.

using the Nobeyama 45m telescope (NRO45) and the Combined Array for Research in
Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). The H$\alpha$ images of barred spiral
galaxies often show active star formation in spiral arms, but less so in bars.
We quantify the difference by measuring star formation rate and efficiency at a
scale where local star formation is spatially resolved. Our CO map covers the
central 2$\farcm$3 region of the galaxy; the combination of NRO45 and CARMA
provides a high fidelity image, enabling accurate measurements of molecular gas
surface density. We find that star formation rate and efficiency are twice as
high in the spiral arms as in the bar. We discuss this difference in the
context of the Kennicutt-Schimidt (KS) law, which indicates a constant star
formation rate at a given gas surface density. The KS law breaks down at our
native resolution ($\sim$ 250 pc), and substantial smoothing (to 500 pc) is
necessary to reproduce the KS law, although with greater scatter.

affirmative and introduce a new convergence test particularly designed for this
