regulating the phase transition between the cold cloudy and warm diffuse medium
of the interstellar medium. Considerable interest has also been devoted in
investigating the properties of turbulence in thermally unstable flows, special
emphasis on molecular clouds and the possibility of star formation. In this
study, we investigate another setting in which this instability may be
important, namely its effect on dynamo action in interstellar flows. The setup
we consider is a three dimensional periodic cube of gas with an initially weak
magnetic field, subject to heating and cooling, the properties of which are
such that thermal instability is provoked at certain temperature regime. Dynamo
action is established through external forcing on the flow field. By comparing
the results with a cooling function with exactly the same net effect but no
thermally unstable regime, we find the following. The critical Reynolds number
for the onset of the large-scale dynamo was observed to roughly double between
the thermally stable versus unstable runs, the conclusion being that the
thermal instability makes large-scale dynamo action more difficult. Whereas
density and magnetic fields were observed to be almost completely uncorrelated
in the thermally stable cases investigated, the action of thermal instability
was observed to produce a positive correlation of the form B propto rho^0.2.
This correlation is rather weak, and in addition it was observed to break down
at the limit of the highest densities.

located at the two beam-crossing points at the Tevatron ppbar collider. The top
quark is the most massive of the known elementary particles. At hadron-hadron
colliders, top quarks are mostly produced in pairs through strong interactions.
The measurement of the cross section for top quark pair production is a test of
our understanding of QCD prediction at next-to-leading order (NLO). This
measurement requires a deep understanding of the backgrounds to top quark
production, thus setting the ground for the measurements of top quark intrinsic
properties. Finally, measuring sigma(ttbar) allows to set limits on new physics
models that predict new particles coupling to the most recently discovered
quark. The top quark discovery needed only few tens of p-1 . The Tevatron
integrated luminosity is now about 9 fb-1 , more than two orders of magnitude
larger. In this document I will present some of the latest measurements of
total and differential cross sections for top quark pair production performed
by the CDF and D0 collaborations, that analyze up to about 6 fb-1 to provide a
refined understanding of this extremely interesting particle. The
identification of hadronic jets with sub- structure is thought to be a crucial
tool towards the search for new phenomena at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)

underlying mechanisms explaining how the elastic nature of the wings is related

cubic nonlinearities coming from the clamped-free beam equation used to model
the wing and a quadratic damping term representing the fluid drag associated to

especially looking for resonance to achieve larger flapping amplitudes with
less effort, but by tuning the temporal evolution of the wing shape (i.e. the
phase dynamics in the oscillator model) to optimize the aerodynamics.

the ocean of an accreting neutron star, and argue that the retention of light
elements in the liquid acts as a source of buoyancy that drives a slow but
continual mixing of the ocean, enriching it substantially in light elements,
and leading to a relatively uniform composition with depth. We first consider
the timescales associated with different processes that can redistribute
elements in the ocean, including convection, sedimentation, crystallization,
and diffusion. We then calculate the steady state structure of the ocean of a
neutron star for an illustrative model in which the accreted hydrogen and
helium burns to produce a mixture of O and Se. Even though the H/He burning
produces only 2% oxygen by mass, the steady state ocean has an oxygen abundance
more than ten times larger, almost 40% by mass. Furthermore, we show that the
convective motions transport heat inwards, with a flux of ~ 0.2 MeV per nucleon
for an O-Se ocean, heating the ocean and steepening the outwards temperature
gradient. The enrichment of light elements and heating of the ocean due to
compositionally-driven convection likely have important implications for carbon
ignition models of superbursts.

Einstein's field equations there is a class of geometries, with certain
singularities, where the components of the metric density and their partial
derivatives remain finite in the limit where the singularity is approached.
Here we exploit this regular behavior of the metric density and elevate its
status to that of a fundamental variable -- from which the metric is
constructed. We express Einstein's field equations as a set of equations for
the metric density, and postulate junction conditions that the metric density
satisfies at singularities. Using this model we extend certain geometries

chromosphere that rises into the corona while being heated. Its source lies in
a region with large field gradients and intense electric currents, which lead
to a strong Lorentz force that squeezes the chromospheric material, resulting
in a vertical pressure gradient that propels the spicule along the magnetic
field, as well as Joule heating, which heats the the jet material, forcing it

important information about different logics. It is well known that the proofs
of those results for several modal logics have, somehow, the same 'taste'. A
general proof for most modal logics below first order is still too ambitious.
In this thesis we plan to isolate sufficient conditions for the
characterization and definability theorems to hold in a wide range of logics.
Along with these conditions we will prove that, whichever logic that meets
them, satisfies both theorems. Therefore, one could give an unifying proof for
logics with already known results. Moreover, one will be able to prove
characterization and definability results for logics that have not yet been
investigated. In both cases, it is only needed to check that a logic meets the
requirements to automatically derive the desired results.

orthogonally to the gradient at rejected proposals, since the gradients at

B-type stars, taking into account the effects of the Coriolis force and the
rotational deformation. From an analysis treating rotation frequency as a small
parameter it is found that slow rotation tends to $destabilize$ high
radial-order $retrograde$ $g$-modes, although the effect is very small or
absent for relatively low order modes. Calculating eigenfrequencies at selected
rotation rates, we find, on the other hand, that rapid rotation tends to
$stabilize$ $retrograde$ $g$-modes. The stabilizing effect appears stronger for
less massive B-type stars having low effective temperatures. If we change
rotation rate continuously, the frequency of a $g$-mode belonging to ($l', m$)
crosses frequencies of other $g$-modes belonging to ($l', m$). If the parity of
the two encountering modes are the same, they interact each other and the
stability (i.e., imaginary part of eigenfrequency) of each mode is modified.
Using an asymptotic method we discuss the property of such mode crossings and
couplings. For rapidly rotating stars mode couplings are important for the
stability of low degree $g$-modes. In particular, we find that the
stabilization of retrograde $g$-modes in rapidly rotating stars is due to many
strong mode couplings, while %prograde sectoral% modes are exceptionally immune
to the damping effects from the mode couplings.

importance of low-degree oscillatory convection (nonadiabatic g$^-$) modes.
Although their kinetic energy is largely confined to the convection zone
generated by the Fe opacity peak near $2\times10^5$K, the amplitude can emerge
to the photosphere and should be observable in a certain effective temperature
range. They have periods longer than those of the radial strange modes so that
they seem to be responsible for some of the long-period microvariations of LBVs
(S Dor variables) and $\alpha$ Cyg variables. Moreover, monotonously unstable
radial modes are found in some models whose initial masses are greater than or
equal to $60M_\odot$ with $Z=0.02$. The monotonous instability probably
corresponds to the presence of an optically thick wind. The instability
boundary roughly coincides with the Humphreys-Davidson limit.

theory, its applications in chemistry and the study of electronic structures
keep steadily growing. However, the precise form of the energy functional in
terms of the electron density still eludes us -- and possibly will do so
forever [2]. In what follows we examine a formulation in the same spirit with
phase space variables. The validity of Hohenberg-Kohn-Levy-type theorems on
phase space is recalled. We study the representability problem for reduced
Wigner functions, and proceed to analyze properties of the new functional.
Along the way, new results on states in the phase-space formalism of quantum
mechanics are established. Natural Wigner orbital theory is developed in depth,
with the final aim of constructing accurate correlation-exchange functionals on
phase space. A new proof of the overbinding property of the Mueller functional
is given. This exact theory supplies its home at long last to that illustrious
ancestor, the Thomas-Fermi model.

We confirm that the distribution function for the plaquette has two peaks

a reweighting method combined with the hopping parameter expansion. We find
that the first order transition turns into a crossover as the quark mass

dynamically operating arms that each yield stochastic rewards with unknown
means. The key metric of interest is regret, defined as the gap between the
expected total reward accumulated by an omniscient player that knows the reward
means for each arm, and the expected total reward accumulated by the given
policy. The policies presented in prior work have storage, computation and
regret all growing linearly with the number of arms, which is not scalable when
the number of arms is large. We consider in this work a broad class of
multi-armed bandits with dependent arms that yield rewards as a linear
combination of a set of unknown parameters. For this general framework, we
present efficient policies that are shown to achieve regret that grows
logarithmically with time, and polynomially in the number of unknown parameters
(even though the number of dependent arms may grow exponentially). Furthermore,
these policies only require storage that grows linearly in the number of
unknown parameters. We show that this generalization is broadly applicable and
useful for many interesting tasks in networks that can be formulated as
tractable combinatorial optimization problems with linear objective functions,
such as maximum weight matching, shortest path, and minimum spanning tree
computations.

important role in the study of symmetries of G-structures. Cartan and
Kobayashi-Nagano have given a complete classification of irreducible linear Lie

  If g is the Lie algebra aut(\hat{S}) of infinitesimal linear automorphisms of
a projective variety S \subset \BP V, its prolongation g^{(k)} is related to
the symmetries of cone structures, an important example of which is the variety
of minimal rational tangents in the study of uniruled projective manifolds.
From this perspective, understanding the prolongation aut(\hat{S})^{(k)} is
useful in questions related to the automorphism groups of uniruled projective
manifolds. Our main result is a complete classification of irreducible
non-degenerate nonsingular variety with non zero prolongations, which can be
viewed as a generalization of the result of Cartan and Kobayashi-Nagano. As an
application, we show that when $S$ is linearly normal and Sec(S) \neq P(V), the
blow-up of P(V) along S has the target rigidity property, i.e., any deformation
of a surjective morphism Y \to Bl_S(PV) comes from the automorphisms of

$N$ arms, with rewards on all arms evolving at each time as Markov chains with
known parameters. A player seeks to activate $K \geq 1$ arms at each time in
order to maximize the expected total reward obtained over multiple plays. RMAB
is a challenging problem that is known to be PSPACE-hard in general. We
consider in this work the even harder non-Bayesian RMAB, in which the
parameters of the Markov chain are assumed to be unknown \emph{a priori}. We
develop an original approach to this problem that is applicable when the
corresponding Bayesian problem has the structure that, depending on the known
parameter values, the optimal solution is one of a prescribed finite set of
policies. In such settings, we propose to learn the optimal policy for the
non-Bayesian RMAB by employing a suitable meta-policy which treats each policy
from this finite set as an arm in a different non-Bayesian multi-armed bandit
problem for which a single-arm selection policy is optimal. We demonstrate this
approach by developing a novel sensing policy for opportunistic spectrum access
over unknown dynamic channels. We prove that our policy achieves
near-logarithmic regret (the difference in expected reward compared to a
model-aware genie), which leads to the same average reward that can be achieved
by the optimal policy under a known model. This is the first such result in the
literature for a non-Bayesian RMAB.

and deepest H-alpha narrow-band survey at z=0.84 over the COSMOS and UKIDSS UDS
fields, probing a wide range of densities (from poor fields to rich groups and
clusters, including a confirmed super-cluster with a striking filamentary
structure), we show that the fraction of star-forming galaxies falls
continuously from ~40% in fields to approaching 0% in rich groups/clusters. We
also find that the median SFR increases with environmental density, at least up
to group densities - but only for low and medium mass galaxies, and thus such
enhancement is mass-dependent at z~1. The environment also plays a role in
setting the faint-end slope (alpha) of the H-alpha luminosity function. Our
findings provide a sharper view on galaxy formation and evolution and reconcile
previously contradictory results at z~1: stellar mass is the primary predictor
of star formation activity, but the environment also plays a major role.

hierarchical group, in particular, the c-random walks. Such walks are used,
e.g., in population genetics. The number variance problem consists in
investigating if the variance of the number of ""particles"" N_n(L) lying in the
ball of radius L at a given time n remains bounded, or even better, converges
to a finite limit, as $L\to \infty$. We give a necessary and sufficient
condition and discuss its relationship to transience/recurrence property of the
walk. Next we consider normalized fluctuations of N_n(L) around the mean as
$n\to \infty$ and L is increased in an appropriate way. We prove convergence of
finite dimensional distributions to a Gaussian process whose properties are
discussed. As the c-random walks mimic symmetric stable processes on R, we
compare our results to those obtained by Hambly and Jones (2007,2009), where
the number variance problem for an infinite system of symmetric stable
processes on R was studied. Since the hierarchical group is an ultrametric
space, corresponding results for symmetric stable processes and hierarchical
random walks may be analogous or quite different, as has been observed in other
contexts. An example of a difference in the present context is that for the
stable processes a fluctuation limit process is a centered Gaussian process
which is not Markovian and has long range dependent stationary increments, but
the counterpart for hierarchical random walks is Markovian, and in a special
case it has independent increments.

magnetospheric accretion processes of the classical TTauri star (cTTS)
V2129Oph. In this paper, we present spectropolarimetric observations collected
in 2009 July with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT).
Circularly polarised Zeeman signatures are clearly detected, both in
photospheric absorption and accretion-powered emission lines, from time-series
of which we reconstruct new maps of the magnetic field, photospheric brightness
and accretion-powered emission at the surface of V2129Oph using our newest
tomographic imaging tool - to be compared with those derived from our old 2005
June data set, reanalyzed in the exact same way.
  We find that in 2009 July, V2129Oph hosts octupolar & dipolar field
components of about 2.1 & 0.9kG respectively, both tilted by about 20deg with
respect to the rotation axis; we conclude that the large-scale magnetic
topology changed significantly since 2005 June (when the octupole and dipole
components were about 1.5 and 3 times weaker respectively), demonstrating that
the field of V2129Oph is generated by a non-stationary dynamo. We also show
that V2129Oph features a dark photospheric spot and a localised area of
accretion-powered emission, both close to the main surface magnetic region
(hosting fields of up to about 4kG in 2009 July). We finally obtain that the
surface shear of V2129Oph is about half as strong as solar.
  From the fluxes of accretion-powered emission lines, we estimate that the
observed average logarithmic accretion rate (in Msun/yr) at the surface of
V2129Oph is -9.2+-0.3 at both epochs, peaking at -9.0 at magnetic maximum. It
implies in particular that the radius at which the magnetic field of V2129Oph
truncates the inner accretion disc is 0.93x and 0.50x the corotation radius in
2009 July and 2005 June respectively.

evaluated via simulation, and the results show the validity of the proposed

Gaussian BP that is run over the two MRF and proves its convergence in mean to
the linear MMSE estimates. The result lies on the same line of those in [16]

First results are presented for seven close binary sdBs with short orbital
periods ranging from 0.21 d to 1.5 d. The atmospheric parameters of all objects
are compatible with core helium-burning stars. The companions are most likely
white dwarfs. In one case the companion could be shown to be a white dwarf by
the absence of light-curve variations. However, in most cases late type main
sequence stars cannot be firmly excluded. Comparing our small sample with the

richer behavior is revealed, including complicated extinction probabilities and

microwaves that may give rise to extra anisotropy signals in the multipole of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment. Constraints are derived from
the absence of positive detection of such anisotropies for ell < 50, giving the
total mass of Edgeworth-Kuiper belt objects to be smaller than 0.2 earth mass.
This limit is consistent with the mass extrapolated from the observable
population with the size of a > 15 km, assuming that the small-object
population follows the power law in size dN/da ~ a^{-q} with the canonical
index expected for collisional equilibrium, q ~ 3.5, with which 23% of the mass
is ascribed to objects smaller than are observationally accessible down to
grains. A similar argument applied to the main asteroid belt indicates that the
grain population should not increase faster than q ~ 3.6 towards smaller radii,
if it follows the power law continued to observed asteroids with larger radii.
It is underlined that both cases are at or only slightly above the limit that
can be physically significant, implying the importance of tightening further
the CMB anisotropy limit, which may be attained with the observation at higher
radio frequencies.

protoplanetary disc. We use a Hamiltonian model to thoroughly investigate the
capture behaviour for first and second order resonances. Using this method, all
resonances of the same order can be described by one equation, with
applications to specific resonances by appropriate scaling. We focus on the
limit where one body is a massless test particle and the other a massive
planet. We quantify how the the probability of capture into a resonance depends
on the relative migration rate of the planet and particle, and the particle's
eccentricity. Resonant capture fails for high migration rates, and has
decreasing probability for higher eccentricities, although for certain
migration rates, capture probability peaks at a finite eccentricity. We also
calculate libration amplitudes and the offset of the libration centres for
captured particles, and the change in eccentricity if capture does not occur.
Libration amplitudes are higher for larger initial eccentricity. The model
allows for a complete description of a particle's behaviour as it successively
encounters several resonances. The model is applicable to many scenarios,

systematic perturbation theory around this limit, setting H = 1/2 + epsilon, to
calculate the scaling function R(y) to first order in epsilon. We find that
R(y) behaves as R(y) ~ y^phi as y -> 0 (near the absorbing boundary), while
R(y) ~ y^gamma exp(-y^2/2) as y -> oo, with phi = 1 - 4 epsilon + O(epsilon^2)

the scaling relation phi = (1-H)/H proposed in Ref. [28]. We verify our
findings via numerical simulations for H = 2/3. The tools developed here are
versatile, powerful, and adaptable to different situations.

surrounded by an accretion disk. Such a fact may be used to set constraints on
theories of high-mass star formation, but requires confirmation that the mass
and luminosity of IRAS 20126+4104 are indeed typical of a B0.5 star, which in
turn requires an accurate estimate of the distance. We used the Very Long
Baseline Array and the European VLBI Network to observe the 22.2 GHz water and
6.7 GHz methanol masers in IRAS 20126+4104 at a number of epochs suitably
distributed in time. The absolute positions of the maser features were
established with respect to reference quasars, which allowed us to derive
absolute proper motions. From the parallax of the water masers we obtain a
distance of 1.64 \pm 0.05 kpc, which is very similar to the value adopted so
far in the literature (1.7 kpc) and confirms that IRAS 20126+4104 is a
high-mass (proto)star. From the methanol masers we derive the component in the
plane of the sky of the systemic velocity of the disk+star system (-16 km/s in
right-ascension and +7.6 km/s in declination). Accurate knowledge of the
distance and systemic velocity allows us to improve on the model fit to the
water maser jet presented in a previous study. Finally, we identify two groups
of methanol maser features, one undergoing rotation in the disk and possibly
distributed along a narrow ring centered on the star, the other characterised
by relative proper motions indicating that the features are moving away from
the disk, perpendicular to it. We speculate that the latter group might be
tracing the disk material marginally entrained by the jet.

providing an alternative implementation for LPODs, but also for checking
several properties (under strongly equivalent transformations) of the 'x'

and $G$-reducible if it is in some parabolic of $G$. In this thesis, we
consider the case that $G$ is of exceptional type. When $G$ is of type $G_2$ we
find all conjugacy classes of closed, connected, reductive subgroups of $G$.
When $G$ is of type $F_4$ we find all conjugacy classes of closed, connected,

non-$G$-completely reducible closed, connected, reductive subgroups of $G$.
When $X$ is closed, connected and simple of rank at least two, we find all
conjugacy classes of $G$-irreducible subgroups $X$ of $G$. Together with the
work of Amende in [Ame05] classifying irreducible subgroups of type $A_1$ this
gives a complete classification of the simple subgroups of $G$.
  Amongst the classification of subgroups of $G=F_4(K)$ we find infinite
collections of subgroups $X$ of $G$ which are maximal amongst all reductive
subgroups of $G$ but not maximal subgroups of $G$; thus they are not contained
in any maximal reductive subgroup of $G$. The connected, semisimple subgroups
contained in no maximal reductive subgroup of $G$ are of type $A_1$ when $p=3$
and of semisimple type $A_1^2$ or $A_1$ when $p=2$. Some of those which occur
when $p=2$ act indecomposably on the 26-dimensional irreducible representation
of $G$.
  We also use this classification to find all subgroups of $G=F_4$ which are
generated by short root elements of $G$, by utilising and extending the results

\cite{fasano92}. In this analysis we attempt to determine the best data model
for both observables. We use the bayesian technique to select the best model by
calculating the posterior probabilities and comparing the posterior among the
models. The posteriors probabilities for each data model are computed using a
Nested sampling integration. From this analysis we concluded that $C_{x'}$ and
$C_{z'}$ double polarizations require two and three order of associated
Legendre polynomials respectively to describe the data well. The extracted
coefficients of each observable will also be presented. It shows the structure

of blue galaxies in different local densities and at different stellar masses.
We find a strong correlation between colour and stellar mass at all redshifts
up to z~3. Massive red galaxies are already in place at z~3 at the expected
location of the red-sequence in the colour-magnitude diagram, although they are
star forming. We do not find a strong correlation between colour and local
density, however, there may be evidence that the highest overdensities are
populated by a higher fraction of blue galaxies than average or underdense
areas. This could indicating that the colour-density relation at high redshift
is reversed with respect to lower redshifts (z<1), where higher densities are
found to have lower blue fractions. Our data suggests that the possible higher
blue fraction at extreme overdensities might be due to a lack of massive red
galaxies at the highest local densities.

stirred by supernovae (SNe) is investigated. We use a three-dimensional
non-ideal hydrodynamic ISM model in a domain extending 0.5 x 0.5 kpc
horizontally and 2 kpc vertically to explore the relative importance of various
physical and numerical effects on the multi-phase, turbulent ISM. We include
both Type I and II SNe, the latter occurring only in dense regions. First we
investigate the role of the thermal instability in the temperature range
300-6100 K, comparing results obtained for two different cooling functions, one
susceptible to the instability, the other stable. The presence of thermal
instability in the system is mainly visible as the tendency of the gas to avoid
the relevant temperature range, as it quickly evolves towards either colder or
warmer phases. Nevertheless, the formation of dense structures for both cooling
functions appears to be dominated by expanding and colliding supernova
remnants, rather than by the thermal instability. As we need to include a
finite thermal conduction coefficient to resolve the thermal instability with
our uniform grid, we also explore the effects of changing Prandtl number on the
system. The purely divergent SN forcing is found to produce significant amounts
of vorticity. The relative vorticity is around 0.6-0.7 for the highest Prandtl
numbers explored, Pr=40, and is observed to diminish almost by a factor of two
for the lowest Prandtl numbers studied, Pr=1. Rotation laws with angular
velocity decreasing or increasing outwards are investigated, enabling us to
separate the contributions to kinetic helicity due to rotation and shear. When
angular velocity decreases outwards, these two contributions partly cancel each
other, resulting in a smaller net helicity.

considering ferromagnetic quantum criticality in the surface of three
dimensional topological insulators. Although an analysis based on the random
phase approximation has been performed for multi-scale quantum criticality, an
extension to an Eliashberg framework was claimed to be far from triviality in
respect that the self-energy correction beyond the random phase approximation,
which originates from scattering with $z = 3$ longitudinal fluctuations,
changes the dynamical exponent $z = 2$ in the transverse mode, explicitly
demonstrated in nematic quantum criticality. A novel ingredient of the present
study is to introduce an anomalous self-energy associated with the spin-flip
channel. Such an anomalous self-energy turns out to be essential for
self-consistency of the Eliashberg framework in the multi-scale quantum
critical point because this off diagonal self-energy cancels the normal
self-energy exactly in the low energy limit, preserving the dynamics of both $z
= 3$ longitudinal and $z = 2$ transverse modes. This multi-scale quantum
criticality is consistent with that in a perturbative analysis for the nematic
quantum critical point, where a vertex correction in the fermion bubble diagram
cancels a singular contribution due to the self-energy correction, maintaining
the $z = 2$ transverse mode. We also claim that this off diagonal self-energy
gives rise to an artificial electric field in the energy-momentum space in
addition to the Berry curvature. We discuss the role of such an anomalous
self-energy in the anomalous Hall conductivity.
