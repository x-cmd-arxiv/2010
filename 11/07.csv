random r-regular graph on n vertices. In this process, a vertex with at least
\theta occupied neighbors at time t will be occupied at time t+1 with
probability p, and vacant otherwise. We show that if $\theta \ge 2$ and $r \ge
\theta+2$, $\epsilon_1$ is small and p is at least $p_1(\epsilon_1)$, then
starting from all vertices occupied the fraction of occupied vertices stays
above $1-2\epsilon_1$ up to time $\exp(\gamma_1(r)n)$ with probability at least
$1 - \exp(-\gamma_1(r)n)$. In the other direction, we show that for $p_2 < 1$
there is an $\epsilon_2(p_2)>0$ so that if $p \le p_2$ and the number of
occupied vertices in the initial configuration is at most $\epsilon_2(p_2)n$,
then with high probability all vertices are vacant at time $C_2(p_2) \log(n)$.
These two conclusions imply that on the random r-regular graph there cannot be
a quasi-stationary distribution with density of occupied vertices between 0 and
$\epsilon_2(p_1)$, and allow us to conclude that the process on the r-tree has
a first order phase transition.

the bandgap of pure AlN which reaches to minimum value of 3.0 eV when Al is

  http://bugassist.mpi-sws.org",,,,"cs.PL cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Much effort is spent everyday by programmers in trying to reduce long,
failing execution traces to the cause of the error. We present a new algorithm
for error cause localization based on a reduction to the maximal satisfiability
problem (MAX-SAT), which asks what is the maximum number of clauses of a
Boolean formula that can be simultaneously satisfied by an assignment. At an
intuitive level, our algorithm takes as input a program and a failing test, and
comprises the following three steps. First, using symbolic execution, we encode
a trace of a program as a Boolean trace formula which is satisfiable iff the
trace is feasible. Second, for a failing program execution (e.g., one that
violates an assertion or a post-condition), we construct an unsatisfiable
formula by taking the trace formula and additionally asserting that the input
is the failing test and that the assertion condition does hold at the end.
Third, using MAX-SAT, we find a maximal set of clauses in this formula that can
be satisfied together, and output the complement set as a potential cause of
the error. We have implemented our algorithm in a tool called bug-assist for C
programs. We demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the tool on a set of
benchmark examples with injected faults, and show that in most cases,
bug-assist can quickly and precisely isolate the exact few lines of code whose
change eliminates the error. We also demonstrate how our algorithm can be
modified to automatically suggest fixes for common classes of errors such as
off-by-one.

The mean outburst interval is 197 \pm 59 d, with a median of 193 d. The March
2008 superoutburst was preceeded by a precursor outburst, had an amplitude of
4.2 magnitudes, and the whole event lasted about 16 days. No superhumps were
detected during the decline from the precursor outburst, and our data suggests
instead that orbital humps were present during that phase. Early superhumps
detected during the rise to the superoutburst maximum exhibited an unusually
large fractional period excess of epsilon = 0.137 (Psh = 0.0856(88) d).
Following the maximum, a linear decline in brightness followed, lasting at
least 6 days. During this decline, a stable superhump period of Psh =
0.07824(2) d was measured. Superimposed on the superhumps were orbital humps,
which allowed us to accurately measure the orbital period of HS 0417+7445, Porb
= 0.07531(8) d, which was previously only poorly estimated. The fractional
superhump period excess during the main phase of the outburst was epsilon =
0.037, which is typical for SU UMa dwarf novae with similar orbital period. Our
observations are consistent with the predictions of the thermal-tidal

Molecular dynamics simulation has played an important role in uncovering the

accurately predicted over a wide range of conditions by determining the
activation free energy from umbrella sampling. Our data reveal very large
activation entropies, which contribute a multiplicative factor of many orders
of magnitude to the nucleation rate. The activation entropy at constant strain
is caused by thermal expansion, with negligible contribution from the
vibrational entropy. The activation entropy at constant stress is significant
larger than that at constant strain, as a result of thermal softening. The
large activation entropies are caused by anharmonic effects, showing the
limitations of the harmonic approximation widely used in solids. Similar
behaviors are expected to occur in other nucleation processes in solids.

Lie algebra. Depending on the form of $g$ one arrives at two different NC
versions of the NCGSG$_{1,2}$/NCGMT$_{1,2}$ correspondence. In the
NCGSG$_{1,2}$ sectors, through consistent reduction procedures, we find NC
versions of some well-known models, such as the NC sine-Gordon (NCSG$_{1,2}$)
(Lechtenfeld et al. and Grisaru-Penati proposals, respectively), NC (bosonized)
Bukhvostov-Lipatov (NCbBL$_{1,2}$) and NC double sine-Gordon (NCDSG$_{1,2}$)

multiphase flow, where the shock acceleration causes the second (embedded)

encoder and the decoder can control the availability or the quality of the
noise-free feedback. Specifically, the instantaneous feedback is a function of
an action taken by the encoder, an action taken by the decoder, and the channel
output. Encoder and decoder actions take values in finite alphabets, and may be
subject to average cost constraints. We prove capacity results for such a
setting by constructing a sequence of achievable rates, using a simple scheme
based on 'code tree' generation, that generates channel input symbols along
with encoder and decoder actions. We prove that the limit of this sequence
exists. For a given block length and probability of error, we give an upper
bound on the maximum achievable rate. Our upper and lower bounds coincide and
hence yield the capacity for the case where the probability of initial state is
positive for all states. Further, for stationary indecomposable channels
without intersymbol interference (ISI), the capacity is given as the limit of
normalized directed information between the input and output sequence,
maximized over an appropriate set of causally conditioned distributions. As an
important special case, we consider the framework of 'to feed or not to feed
back' where either the encoder or the decoder takes binary actions, which
determine whether current channel output will be fed back to the encoder, with

one half of a pair of perfectly correlated bitstrings, even the most sensitive

black hole physics. Previous work on information locking had always assumed a
uniform message. In this article, we assume only a min-entropy bound on the

the presence of cavities. However, when the Unruh and Hartle-Hawking vacua are

break very easily under microscopical stretching; on the other hand, they are
extremely flexible, presenting deformations even at small scales. Consequently,
a piece of membrane has an area excess relative to its optically resolvable
area, also called projected area. From a mechanical point of view, we can thus
identify three tensions associated to lipid membranes: the mechanical effective
tension $\tau$, associated to an increase in the projected area and to the
flattening of the fluctuations; the tension $\sigma$, associated to the
microscopical area of the membrane and thus non measurable, but commonly used
in theoretical predictions; and its macroscopical counterpart measured through
the fluctuation spectrum, $r$. Up to now, the equality between these quantities
was taken for granted when analyzing experimental data. In this dissertation,
we have studied, using the projected stress tensor, whether and under which
conditions it is justified to assume $\tau = \sigma$. We studied three
geometries (planar, spherical and cylindrical) and obtained the relation $\tau
\approx \sigma - \sigma_0$, where $\sigma_0$ is a constant depending only on
the membrane's high frequency cutoff and on the temperature. Accordingly, we
conclude that neglecting the difference between $\tau$ and $\sigma$ is
justifiable only to membranes under large tensions: in the case of small
tensions, corrections must be taken into account. We have studied the
implications of this result to the interpretation of experiments involving
membrane nanotubes. Regarding $r$, we have questioned a former demonstration
concerning its equality with $\tau$. Finally, the force fluctuation for planar
membranes and membrane nanotubes was quantified for the first time.

depend on the local arrangement of the powder particles. Experiments have shown
that more heterogeneous microstructures exhibit up to one order of magnitude
higher elastic properties than their more homogeneous counterparts at equal
volume fraction. In this paper, packings of spherical particles are used as
model structures to computationally investigate the elastic properties of
coagulated particle gels as a function of their degree of heterogeneity. The
discrete element model comprises a linear elastic contact law, particle bonding
and damping. The simulation parameters were calibrated using a homogeneous and
a heterogeneous microstructure originating from earlier Brownian dynamics
simulations. A systematic study of the elastic properties as a function of the
degree of heterogeneity was performed using two sets of microstructures
obtained from Brownian dynamics simulation and from the void expansion method.
Both sets cover a broad and to a large extent overlapping range of degrees of
heterogeneity. The simulations have shown that the elastic properties as a
function of the degree of heterogeneity are independent of the structure
generation algorithm and that the relation between the shear modulus and the
degree of heterogeneity can be well described by a power law. This suggests the
presence of a critical degree of heterogeneity and, therefore, a phase
transition between a phase with finite and one with zero elastic properties.
