model EM wave emission generation in the context of solar type III radio
bursts. The model studies generation of EM waves by a super-thermal, hot beam
of electrons injected into a plasma thread that contains uniform longitudinal
magnetic field and a parabolic density gradient. In effect, a single magnetic
line connecting Sun to earth is considered, for which several cases are
studied. (i) We find that the physical system without a beam is stable and only
low amplitude level EM drift waves (noise) are excited. (ii) The beam injection
direction is controlled by setting either longitudinal or oblique electron
initial drift speed, i.e. by setting the beam pitch angle. In the case of zero
pitch angle, the beam excites only electrostatic, standing waves, oscillating
at plasma frequency, in the beam injection spatial location, and only low level
EM drift wave noise is also generated. (iii) In the case of oblique beam pitch
angles, again electrostatic waves with same properties are excited. However,
now the beam also generates EM waves with the properties commensurate to type
III radio bursts. The latter is evidenced by the wavelet analysis of transverse
electric field component, which shows that as the beam moves to the regions of
lower density, frequency of the EM waves drops accordingly. (iv) When the
density gradient is removed, electron beam with an oblique pitch angle still
generates the EM radiation. However, in the latter case no frequency decrease
is seen. Within the limitations of the model, the study presents the first
attempt to produce simulated dynamical spectrum of type III radio bursts in
fully kinetic plasma model. The latter is based on 1.5D non-zero pitch angle
(non-gyrotropic) electron beam, that is an alternative to the plasma emission
classical mechanism.

where the ionization level is typically low. We show that ambient electrons
become magnetized even for weak magnetic fields (30 G); that is, their
gyrofrequency becomes larger than the collision frequency while ion motions
continue to be dominated by ion-neutral collisions. Under such conditions, ions
are dragged by neutrals, and the magnetic field acts as if it is frozen-in to
the dynamics of the neutral gas. However, magnetized electrons drift under the
action of the electric and magnetic fields induced in the reference frame of
ions moving with the neutral gas. We find that this relative motion of
electrons and ions results in the generation of quite intense electric
currents. The dissipation of these currents leads to resistive electron heating
and efficient gas ionization. Ionization by electron-neutral impact does not
alter the dynamics of the heavy particles; thus, the gas turbulent motions
continue even when the plasma becomes fully ionized, and resistive dissipation
continues to heat electrons and ions. This heating process is so efficient that
it can result in typical temperature increases with altitude as large as
0.1-0.3 eV/km. We conclude that this process can play a major role in the
heating of the chromosphere and corona

models are abstract descriptions of dynamical systems where one symbolic state
and one symbolic input correspond to an aggregate of states and an aggregate of

then derive sufficient conditions for the existence of symbolic models that are
shown to be alternating approximately bisimilar to the original system. Further
results are also derived which prove the computability of the proposed symbolic

lensing in the galactic center. Unlike in most applications of gravitational
lensing, where the bending angle is of the order of several arc seconds, very
large bending angles are possible for light that closely approaches a black

the property of light lensed by the S stars orbiting in the galactic center.

largest source of bias at z ~ 5, while uncertainties in the mean transmitted
Ly-alpha flux are responsible for the largest bias at z ~ 6. The impacts of
large-scale overdensities and Lyman limit systems on Gamma_bkg were also

Gamma_bkg appears to be gradual, and we find no evidence for a sudden change in

space condition $u \in L^{\infty}(L^{\alpha ,*})$ (with
$\frac{3}{4}(17^{\frac{1}{2}} -1)< \alpha < 3 $) and some exponential control
on the growth rate of $\dv (\frac{u}{|u|})$ along the streamlines of u. This
regularity criterion greatly improves the previous one in
\cite{smoothnesscriteria}. The proof leading to the regularity criterion of our
paper basically follows the one in \cite{smoothnesscriteria}. However, we also
point out that totally new idea which involves the use of the new supercritical
function space condition is necessary for the success of our new regularity
criterion in this paper. The second goal of our paper is to construct a
divergence free vector field $u$ within a flow-invariant tubular region with
increasing twisting of streamlines towards one end of a bundle of streamlines.
The increasing twisting of streamlines is controlled in such a way that the
associated quantities $\|u\|_{L^{\alpha}}$ and $\|\dv(\frac{u}{|u|})\|_{L^{6}}$
blow up while preserving the finite energy property $u\in L^{2}$ at the same
time. The purpose of such a construction is to demonstrate the necessity to go
beyond the scope covered by some previous regularity criteria such as

designed to detect a large number of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) around z~0.2,
the redshift ""gap"" between low-z and high-z SN searches. The survey has
provided multi-band photometric lightcurves for variable targets, and SN
candidates were scheduled for spectroscopic observations, primarily to provide
SN classification and accurate redshifts. We present SN spectra obtained in
2006 and 2007 using the NTT and the NOT. Aims. We provide an atlas of SN
spectra in the range z =0.03-0.32 that complements the well-sampled lightcurves
from SDSS-II in the forthcoming three-year SDSS SN cosmology analysis. The
sample can, for example, be used for spectral studies of SNe Ia, which are
critical for understanding potential systematic effects when SNe are used to
determine cosmological distances. Methods. The spectra were reduced in a
uniform manner, and special care was taken in estimating the uncertainties for
the different processing steps. Host-galaxy light was subtracted when possible
and the SN type fitted using the SuperNova IDentification code (SNID). We also
present comparisons between spectral and photometric dating using SALT
lightcurve fits to the photometry from SDSS-II, as well as the global
distribution of our sample in terms of the lightcurve parameters: stretch and
colour. Results. We report new spectroscopic data from 141 SNe Ia, mainly
between -9 and +15 days from lightcurve maximum, including a few cases of
multi-epoch observations. This homogeneous, host-galaxy subtracted, SN Ia
spectroscopic sample is among the largest such data sets and unique in its

dynamics diffused in the literature, specifically we focus our attention on the
matter energy density, the energy of system, the Ricci scalar and the thin
brane limit. As the model is classically stable and capable of localize
gravity, as a natural extension we address the issue of fermion localization of
fermions on a thick brane constructed out from one scalar field with
nonstandard kinetic terms coupled with gravity. The contribution of the
nonstandard kinetic terms in the problem of fermion localization is analyzed.
It is found that the simplest Yukawa coupling $\eta\bar{\Psi}\phi\Psi$ support
the localization of fermions on the thick brane. It is shown that the zero mode
for left-handed can be localized on the thick brane depending on the values for
the coupling constant $\eta$.

(SN) 2008bk in NGC 7793, primarily at >~ 150 d after explosion. We find that it
is a Type II-Plateau (II-P) SN which most closely resembles the low-luminosity
SN 1999br in NGC 4900. Given the overall similarity between the observed light
curves and colors of SNe 2008bk and 1999br, we infer that the total visual
extinction to SN 2008bk (A_V=0.065 mag) must be almost entirely due to the
Galactic foreground, similar to what has been assumed for SN 1999br. We confirm
the identification of the putative red supergiant (RSG) progenitor star of the
SN in high-quality g'r'i' images we had obtained in 2007 at the Gemini-South 8
m telescope. Little ambiguity exists in this progenitor identification,
qualifying it as the best example to date, next to the identification of the
star Sk -69 202 as the progenitor of SN 1987A. From a combination of photometry
of the Gemini images with that of archival, pre-SN, Very Large Telescope JHK_s
images, we derive an accurate observed spectral energy distribution (SED) for
the progenitor. We find from nebular strong-intensity emission-line indices for
several HII regions near the SN that the metallicity in the environment is
likely subsolar (Z~0.6 Z_Sun). The observed SED of the star agrees quite well
with synthetic SEDs obtained from model red supergiant atmospheres with
effective temperature T_eff=3600+/-50 K. We find, therefore, that the star had
a bolometric luminosity with respect to the Sun of log(L_bol/L_Sun)=4.57+/-0.06
and radius R_star=496+/-34 R_Sun at ~6 months prior to explosion. Comparing the
progenitor's properties with theoretical massive-star evolutionary models, we
conclude that the RSG progenitor had an initial mass in the range of 8--8.5
M_Sun. (Abridged.)

likely to contain hard binary SMBH systems, and also show that the rates of
these repeated events are high enough to be detected by LSST over its lifetime.
Therefore, these multiple tidal disruption events provide a novel method to
identify super-massive black hole (SMBH) binary systems with parsec to
sub-parsec separations. The rates of tidal disruptions are investigated using
simulations of non-interacting stars initially orbiting a primary SMBH and the
potential of the model stellar cusp. The stars are then evolved forward in time
and perturbed by a secondary SMBH inspiraling from the edge of the cusp to its
stalling radius. We find with conservative magnitude estimates that the next
generation transient survey LSST should detect multiple tidal disruptions in
approximately 3 galaxies over 5 years of observation, though less conservative
estimates could increase this rate by an order of magnitude.

for our understanding of RR Lyrae stars in general, these RR Lyr data can be
regarded as a case study for observations of bright stars with Kepler. Kepler
can perform high-precision photometry on targets like RR Lyr, as the saturated
flux is conserved to a very high degree. The Kepler data on RR Lyr are
revolutionary in several respects. Even with long-cadence sampling (one
measurement per 29.4 min), the unprecedented precision (< mmag) of the Kepler
photometry allows the study of the star's extreme light curve variations in
detail. The multiplet structures at the main frequency and its harmonics,
typical for Blazhko stars, are clearly detected up to the quintuplets. For the
first time, photometric data of RR Lyr reveal the presence of half-integer
frequencies, linked to a period doubling effect. This phenomenon may be
connected to the still unexplained Blazhko modulation. Moreover, with three
observed Blazhko cycles at our disposal, we observe that there is no exact
repetition in the light curve changes from one modulation cycle to the next for
RR Lyr. This may be due to additional periodicities in the star, or to
transient or quasi-periodic changes.

density of parameters describing individual supernovae and the population. We

PAIRITEL, CfA3, CSP, and the literature. We find an apparent population
correlation between the host galaxy extinction A_V and the the ratio of
total-to-selective dust absorption R_V. For SN with low dust extinction, A_V <
0.4, we find R_V = 2.5 - 2.9, while at high extinctions, A_V > 1, low values of
R_V < 2 are favored. The NIR luminosities are excellent standard candles and
are less sensitive to dust extinction. They exhibit low correlation with
optical peak luminosities, and thus provide independent information on
distances. The combination of NIR and optical data constrains the dust
extinction and improves the predictive precision of individual SN Ia distances
by about 60%. Using cross-validation, we estimate an rms distance modulus
prediction error of 0.11 mag for SN with optical and NIR data versus 0.15 mag
for SN with optical data alone. Continued study of SN Ia in the NIR is
important for improving their utility as precise and accurate cosmological

plasma in Classical T-Tauri stars (CTTSs), probably arising from the accretion
shock region. However, the mass accretion rates derived from the X-ray
observations are consistently lower than those derived from UV/optical/NIR
studies. We aim to test the hypothesis that the high density soft X-ray
emission is from accretion by analysing optical accretion tracers from an X-ray
selected sample of CTTSs in a homogeneous manner. We analyse optical spectra of
a sample of CTTSs and calculate the accretion rates based on measuring optical
emission lines. These are then compared to the accretion rates derived from the
X-ray spectroscopy. We find that, for each CTTS in our sample, the different
optical tracers predict mass accretion rates that agree within the errors,
albeit with a spread of ~1 order of magnitude. Typically, mass accretion rates
derived from Halpha and HeI 5876 Ang are larger than those derived from Hbeta,
Hgamma and OI. When comparisons of the optical mass accretion rates are made to
the X-ray derived mass accretion rates, we find that: a) the latter are always
lower (but by varying amounts); b) the latter range within a factor of ~2
around 2x10^{-10} M_odot yr^{-1}, despite the fact that the former span a range
of ~3 orders of magnitude. We suggest that the systematic underestimation of
the X-ray derived mass accretion rates could depend on the density distribution
inside the accretion streams, where the densest part of the stream is not
visible in the X-ray band because of the absorption by the stellar atmosphere.
We also suggest that a non-negligible optical depth of X-ray emission lines
produced by post-shock accreting plasma may explain the almost constant mass
accretion rates derived in X-rays if the effect is larger in stars with larger
optical mass accretion rates.

reference models, one containing a W'_R and one containing a W'_L, which may

searches at the LHC. We present the Tevatron bounds on each model and compute
the constraints from precision electroweak observables. We find that indirect
low-energy constraints on the W'_L are quite strong. However, for a W'_R
coupling to right-handed fermions there exists a sizeable region in parameter
space beyond the bounds from the Tevatron and low-energy precision measurements
where even 50 inverse picobarns of integrated LHC luminosity are sufficient to
discover the W'_R. The most promising final states are two leptons and two

continuum polarization at a very significant and almost constant level

strongest emission features, like Halpha and Hbeta. This implies that the line
forming region is well above the photosphere. The continuum polarization level

from low-dimensional measurements y= A^{m*n} x* (m<n) . In this paper, we
investigate the recovering ability of l_p-minimization (0<=p<=1) as p varies,
where l_p-minimization returns a vector with the least l_p ``norm'' among all
the vectors x satisfying Ax=y. Besides analyzing the performance of strong
recovery where l_p-minimization needs to recover all the sparse vectors up to
certain sparsity, we also for the first time analyze the performance of
``weak'' recovery of l_p-minimization (0<=p<1) where the aim is to recover all
the sparse vectors on one support with fixed sign pattern. When m/n goes to 1,
we provide sharp thresholds of the sparsity ratio that differentiates the
success and failure via l_p-minimization. For strong recovery, the threshold
strictly decreases from 0.5 to 0.239 as p increases from 0 to 1. Surprisingly,
for weak recovery, the threshold is 2/3 for all p in [0,1), while the threshold
is 1 for l_1-minimization. We also explicitly demonstrate that l_p-minimization
(p<1) can return a denser solution than l_1-minimization. For any m/n<1, we
provide bounds of sparsity ratio for strong recovery and weak recovery
respectively below which l_p-minimization succeeds with overwhelming
probability. Our bound of strong recovery improves on the existing bounds when
m/n is large. Regarding the recovery threshold, l_p-minimization has a higher
threshold with smaller p for strong recovery; the threshold is the same for all
p for sectional recovery; and l_1-minimization can outperform l_p-minimization
for weak recovery. These are in contrast to traditional wisdom that
l_p-minimization has better sparse recovery ability than l_1-minimization since
it is closer to l_0-minimization. We provide an intuitive explanation to our
findings and use numerical examples to illustrate the theoretical predictions.

formed from high-mass, high-density giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in their host
galactic building blocks embedded in dark matter halos at high redshifts and
(ii) their evolution therefore can be significantly influenced by M_s, their
initial locations, and physical properties of their hosts. Our 3D
hydrodynamical simulations show that gaseous ejecta from AGB stars can be
retained within MSCs and consequently converted into new stars very efficiently
in the central regions of MSCs, only if M_s exceed a threshold mass (M_th) of
~10^6 M_sun. The new stars can correspond to the ``second generation (SG)'' of
stars with higher Na and lower O abundances observed in GCs. Star formation
efficiencies during the formation of SG stars within MSCs with M_s > M_th can
be rather high (0.3-0.9) so that very compact new clusters within original MSCs
can be formed. M_s should be as large as 10^6-10^7 M_sun to explain the
observed large fraction of SG stars in the present ordinary Galactic GCs,
because new stars can consist of only 1-4% among all stars for the standard
IMF. Nuclear MSCs are found to retain much more effectively the AGB ejecta and
convert more efficiently the gas into new stars owing to much deeper
gravitational potential of their hosts. We suggest that both M_s and their
locations within their hosts can determine whether abundance spread can be seen
only in light elements or even in heavy ones.

of Noise Removal, based on the theory of Reproducing Kernels Hilbert Spaces
(RKHS). The problem is cast as an optimization task in a RKHS, by taking
advantage of the celebrated semiparametric Representer Theorem. Examples verify
that in the presence of gaussian noise the proposed method performs relatively
well compared to wavelet based technics and outperforms them significantly in
the presence of impulse or mixed noise.

  Boundary Conditions",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent works several authors have proposed the use of precise boundary
conditions (BCs) for blurring models and they proved that the resulting choice
(Neumann or reflective, anti-reflective) leads to fast algorithms both for
deblurring and for detecting the regularization parameters in presence of
noise. When considering a symmetric point spread function, the crucial fact is
that such BCs are related to fast trigonometric transforms.
  In this paper we combine the use of precise BCs with the Total Variation (TV)
approach in order to preserve the jumps of the given signal (edges of the given
image) as much as possible. We consider a classic fixed point method with a
preconditioned Krylov method (usually the conjugate gradient method) for the
inner iteration. Based on fast trigonometric transforms, we propose some
preconditioning strategies which are suitable for reflective and
anti-reflective BCs. A theoretical analysis motivates the choice of our
preconditioners and an extensive numerical experimentation is reported and
critically discussed. The latter shows that the TV regularization with
anti-reflective BCs implies not only a reduced analytical error, but also a
lower computational cost of the whole restoration procedure over the other BCs.

the photosphere. Therefore, one has to infer the field strength in the higher
layers of the solar atmosphere from the measured photospheric field based on
the assumption that the corona is force-free. Meanwhile, those measured data
are inconsistent with the above force-free assumption. Therefore, one has to
apply some transformations to these data before nonlinear force-free
extrapolation codes can be applied. Extrapolation codes in cartesian geometry
for modelling the magnetic field in the corona do not take the curvature of the
Sun's surface into account and can only be applied to relatively small areas,
e.g., a single active region. Here we apply a method for nonlinear force-free
coronal magnetic field modelling and preprocessing of photospheric vector
magnetograms in spherical geometry using the optimization procedure.We solve
the nonlinear force-free field equations by minimizing a functional in
spherical coordinates over a restricted area of the Sun. We extend the
functional by an additional term, which allows to incorporate measurement error
and treat regions with lacking observational data. We use vector magnetograph
data from the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun survey
(SOLIS) to model the coronal magnetic field. We study two neighbouring
magnetically connected active regions observed on May 15 2009. For vector
magnetograms with variable measurement precision and randomly scattered data
gaps (e.g., SOLIS/VSM) the new code yields field models which satisfy the
solenoidal and force-free condition significantly better as it allows
deviations between the extrapolated boundary field and observed boundary data
within measurement errors. Data gaps are assigned to an infinite error. We
extend this new scheme to spherical geometry and apply it for the first time to
real data.
