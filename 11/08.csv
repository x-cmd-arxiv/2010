lower Higgs boson mass bounds. This investigation is based on the numerical
evaluation of a chirally invariant lattice Higgs-Yukawa model emulating the
same Higgs-fermion coupling structure as in the Higgs sector of the electroweak
Standard Model. In particular, the considered model obeys a Ginsparg-Wilson
version of the underlying ${SU}(2)_L\times {U}(1)_Y$ symmetry, being a global
symmetry here due to the neglection of gauge fields in this model. We present
our results on the modification of the upper and lower Higgs boson mass bounds
induced by the presence of a hypothetical very heavy fourth quark doublet.
Finally, we compare these findings to the standard scenario of three fermion
generations.

have raised the question of the origin of the emission detected in the
termination structures of their jets. The study of these structures can give
information on the conditions for particle acceleration and radiation at the
front shocks. In addition, an evolutionary scenario can help to disentangle the
origin of the detected X-ray emission in young FRI sources, like some Gigahertz
Peaked Spectrum AGNs. This work focuses on the nature and detectability of the
radiation seen from the termination regions of evolving FRI jets. We use the
results of a relativistic, two-dimensional numerical simulation of the
propagation of an FRI jet, coupled with a radiation model, to make predictions
for the spectra and lightcurves of the thermal and non-thermal emission at
different stages of the FRI evolution. Our results show that under moderate
magnetic fields, the synchrotron radiation would be the dominant non-thermal
channel, appearing extended in radio and more compact in X-rays, with
relatively small flux variations with time. The shocked jet synchrotron
emission would dominate the X-ray band, although the shocked ISM/ICM thermal
component alone may be significant in old sources. Inverse Compton scattering
of CMB photons could yield significant fluxes in the GeV and TeV bands, with a
non-negligible X-ray contribution. The IC radiation would present a bigger
angular size in X-rays and GeV than in TeV, with fluxes increasing with time.
We conclude that the thermal and non-thermal broadband emission from the
termination regions of FRI jets could be detectable for sources located up to
distances of a few 100 Mpc.

from the Sgr B region is from a strong source to the south of Sgr B2, which we
label Sgr B2 Southern Complex (SC). We find Sgr B2(SC) integrated flux
densities of 1.2+/-0.2 Jy at 1384 MHz and 0.7+/-0.1 Jy at 2368 MHz for a source
of FWHM size at 1384 MHz of ~54"". Despite its non-thermal nature, the

constrain the diffusion coefficient for transport of the parent hadronic CRs
into the dense core of Sgr B2 to be no larger than about 1% of that in the
Galactic disk. Finally, we have also used the data to perform a spectral and
morphological study of the features of the Sgr B cloud and compare and contrast
these to previous studies.

  Assuming that information is fundamental and the information propagates with

law and Einstein's equation simply describe the energy-information relation
(dE=TdS) for matter or space time crossing causal horizons. Quantum mechanics
is related to the phase space information loss of matter crossing the Rindler
horizon, which explains why superluminal communication is impossible even with
quantum entanglement. This approach also explains the origin of Jacobson's
thermodynamic formalism of Einstein gravity and Verlinde's entropic gravity.
When applied to a cosmic causal horizon, the conjecture can reproduce the
observed dark energy and the zero cosmological constant. Quantum entanglement,
path integral, and holography are also natural consequences of this theory.

of the iron-pnictide and chalcogenides. We first describe the generic band
structure of an isolated FeAs layer. Use of its Abelian glide-mirror group
allows us to reduce the primitive cell to one FeAs unit. From
density-functional theory, we generate the set of eight Fe $d$ and As $p$
localized Wannier functions for LaOFeAs and their tight-binding (TB)
Hamiltonian, $h(k)$. We discuss the topology of the bands, i.e. allowed and
avoided crossings, the origin of the d6 pseudogap, as well as the role of the
As $p$ orbitals and the elongation of the FeAs$_{4}$ tetrahedron. We then
couple the layers, mainly via interlayer hopping between As $p_{z}$ orbitals,
and give the formalism for simple and body-centered tetragonal stackings. This
allows us to explain the material-specific 3D band structures. Due to the high
symmetry, several level inversions take place as functions of $k_{z}$ or
pressure, resulting in linear band dispersions (Dirac cones). The underlying
symmetry elements are, however, easily broken, so that the Dirac points are not
protected, nor pinned to the Fermi level. From the paramagnetic TB Hamiltonian,
we form the band structures for spin spirals with wavevector $q$ by coupling
$h(k)$ and $h (k+q)$. The band structure for stripe order is studied as a
function of the exchange potential, $\Delta$, using Stoner theory. Gapping of
the Fermi surface (FS) for small $\Delta $ requires matching of FS dimensions
(nesting) and $d$-orbital characters. The origin of the propeller-shaped FS is
explained. Finally, we express the magnetic energy as the sum over
band-structure energies, which enables us to understand to what extent the
magnetic energies might be described by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the
interplay between the magnetic moment and the elongation of the FeAs4
tetrahedron.

is not constant in the investigated wavelengths over the whole rotational
period. The monochromatic light curves continuously change their shape with
wavelength. This indicates that we do not observe a truly 'null wavelength
region' where the monochromatic light curve has a zero amplitude. Probably, an
uneven surface distribution of silicon and iron mainly influences the flux
redistribution from the far-UV to near-UV spectral regions, although additional
sources of opacity may be involved. The redistribution of the flux at phase
0.25 is connected with the nonuniform distribution of silicon on the stellar
surface of 56 Ari. On the other hand, the redistribution of the flux at phase
0.65 is quite complex, because there are additional blocking and redistribution
of the flux by iron lines in the near-UV spectral region.

temperature (3K to 296K) and pump intensity using $\sim$ 50 femtosecond laser
pulses with central photon energy of 1.57 eV. The time resolved reflectivity
data show two coherently generated totally symmetric A$_{1g}$ modes at 1.85 THz
and 3.6 THz at 296K which blue shift to 1.9 THz and 4.02 THz, respectively at
3K. At high photoexcited carrier density of $\sim$ 1.7 $\times$
10$^{21}$cm$^{-3}$, the phonon mode at 4.02 THz is two orders of magnitude
higher positively chirped (i.e the phonon time period decreases with increasing
delay time between the pump and the probe pulses) than the lower frequency mode
at 1.9 THz. The chirp parameter, $\beta$ is shown to be inversely varying with
temperature. The time evolution of these modes is studied using continuous
wavelet transform of the time-resolved reflectivity data.

Coating strategies include low-molecular weight ligands (citric acid) and
polymers (poly(acrylic acid), MW = 2000 g mol-1). Electrostatically adsorbed on
the surfaces, the organic moieties provide a negatively charged coating in
physiological conditions. We find that most particles were biocompatible, as
exposed cells remained 100% viable relative to controls. Only the bare and the
citrate-coated nanoceria exhibit a slight decrease of the mitochondrial
activity for cerium concentrations above 5 mM (equivalent to 0.8 g L-1). We
also observe that the citrate-coated particles are internalized by the cells in
large amounts, typically 250 pg per cell after a 24 h incubation for iron
oxide. In contrast, the polymer-coated particles are taken up at much lower
rates (< 30 pg per cell). The strong uptake shown by the citrate-coated
particles is related to the destabilization of the dispersions in the cell
culture medium and their sedimentation down to the cell membranes. In
conclusion, we show that the uptake of nanomaterials by living cells depends on
the coating of the particles and on its ability to preserve the colloidal

susceptibility cusp at the glass transition temperature is due to the dynamic
crossover between the high-temperature relaxational and low-temperature spin
wave, or elastic, regime. The crossover takes place when $t=\tau$, where $t$ is
observation time and $\tau$ is relaxation time. Time-dependent effects,
inconsistent with the phase transition approach, and the logarithmic increase
of $T_g$ with field frequency in particular, originate as the immediate
consequence of the proposed picture. We comment on the behavior of non-linear
susceptibility. In our discussion, we explore similarities between the spin and

algorithms--one time scale associated with the consensus and the other with the
innovations. The paper establishes a distributed observability condition
(global observability plus mean connectedness) under which the distributed
estimates are consistent and asymptotically normal. We introduce the
distributed notion equivalent to the (centralized) Fisher information rate,
which is a bound on the mean square error reduction rate of any distributed
estimator; we show that under the appropriate modeling and structural network
communication conditions (gossip protocol) the distributed gossip estimator
attains this distributed Fisher information rate, asymptotically achieving the
performance of the optimal centralized estimator. Finally, we study the
behavior of the distributed gossip estimator when the measurements fade (noise
variance grows) with time; in particular, we consider the maximum rate at which
the noise variance can grow and still the distributed estimator being

bulk-motion Comptonization operates efficiently. This is enhanced by resonant
cyclotron scattering. The thus scattered photons escape mainly sideways and
produce a fan beam, which is detected as a main pulse up to energies of ~160
keV. The approximately isotropic emission from the stellar surface (soft
thermal photons and reflected hard X-ray ones) is detected as a secondary
pulse. This secondary pulse shows a bump at an energy of ~60 keV, which may be
interpreted as resonant cyclotron scattering of fan-beam photons at the

the colloidal particles segregate from the growing solid, forming

large-length scale structure, as it is the most accessible and thought to be
more technologically relevant. However, the packing of the colloids at the
particle-scale is an important component not only in theoretical descriptions
of the segregation process, but also to the utility of freeze-cast materials
for new applications. Here we present the results of experiments in which we
investigated this structure across a wide range of length scales using a
combination of small angle x-ray scattering and direct optical imaging. As
expected, during freezing the particles were concentrated into regions between
ice dendrites forming a microscopic pattern of high- and low-particle-density
regions. X-ray scattering indicates that the particles in the high density
regions were so closely packed as to be touching. However, the arrangement of
the particles does not conform to that predicted by standard inter-particle
pair potentials, suggesting that the particle packing induced by freezing
differs from that formed during equilibrium densification processes.

reduced shear profiles are generated for ~10^4 cluster-sized halos formed in a
LCDM cosmological N-body simulation of a 1 Gpc/h box. In agreement with
previous studies, we find that the scatter in the weak lensing masses derived
using this fitting method has irreducible contributions from the triaxial
shapes of cluster-sized halos and uncorrelated large-scale matter projections
along the line-of-sight. Additionally, we find that correlated large-scale
structure within several virial radii of clusters contributes a smaller, but
nevertheless significant, amount to the scatter. The intrinsic scatter due to
these physical sources is ~20% for massive clusters, and can be as high as ~30%
for group-sized systems. For current, ground-based observations, however, the
total scatter should be dominated by shape noise from the background galaxies
used to measure the shear. Importantly, we find that weak lensing mass
measurements can have a small, ~5%-10%, but non-negligible amount of bias.
Given that weak lensing measurements of cluster masses are a powerful way to
calibrate cluster mass-observable relations for precision cosmological
constraints, we strongly emphasize that a robust calibration of the bias
requires detailed simulations which include more observational effects than we
consider here. Such a calibration exercise needs to be carried out for each
specific weak lensing mass estimation method, as the details of the method
determine in part the expected scatter and bias. We present an iterative method

plane curves of degree d pass through these points and are tangent to this
curve. We count each such curve with a certain sign, and present an explicit
formula for their algebraic number. This number is preserved under small
regular homotopies of a pair (P, G), but jumps (in a well-controlled way) when
in the process of homotopy we pass a certain singular discriminant. We discuss
the relation of such enumerative problems with finite type invariants. Our
approach is based on maps of configuration spaces and the intersection theory
in the spirit of classical algebraic topology.

their baryons via cold mode accretion. Observations of high-redshift galaxies,
while showing ubiquitous outflows, have so far not revealed convincing traces
of the predicted cold streams, which has been interpreted as a challenge for
the current models. Using high-resolution, zoom-in smooth particle
hydrodynamics simulations of Lyman break galaxy (LBG) halos combined with
ionizing radiative transfer, we quantify the covering factor of the cold
streams at z=2-4. We focus specifically on Lyman limit systems (LLSs) and
damped Ly-alpha absorbers (DLAs), which can be probed by absorption
spectroscopy using a background galaxy or quasar sightline, and which are
closely related to low-ionization metal absorbers. We show that the covering
factor of these systems is relatively small and decreases with time. At z=2,
the covering factor of DLAs within the virial radius of the simulated galaxies
is ~3% (~1% within twice this projected distance), and arises principally from
the galaxy itself. The corresponding values for LLSs are ~10% and ~4%. Because
of their small covering factor compared to the order unity covering fraction
expected for galactic winds, the cold streams are naturally dominated by
outflows in stacked spectra. We conclude that the existing observations are
consistent with the predictions of cold mode accretion, and outline promising
kinematic and chemical diagnostics to separate out the signatures of galactic
accretion and feedback.

expectation value invariable, allowed one to derive all possible forms of the
operators corresponding to the conserved physical entities. As a result, it was
found that only three distinctive forms of the conserved operators are

there are special Wilson loops, called twistor Wilson loops for geometrical
reasons, whose v.e.v. is independent on the parameter that occurs in their
operator definition. There is a semigroup that acts on the parameter by
rescaling and on the functional measure, resolved into anti-selfdual orbits by
a non-supersymmetric version of the Nicolai map, by contracting the support of
the measure. As a consequence the twistor Wilson loops are localized on the
fixed points of the semigroup of contractions. This localization is a
non-supersymmetric analogue of the localization that occurs in the Nekrasov
partition function of the n=2 SUSY YM theory on the fixed points of a certain
torus action on the moduli space of (non-commutative) instantons. One main
consequence of the localization in the large-N YM case, as in the n=2 SUSY YM

asymptotically almost-optimal bounds (in terms of empirical entropy) on the

retrieved efficiently and, significantly, characters at arbitrary positions of
$T$ to be modified quickly during execution \emph{without decompressing the

update a compressed file directly. Moreover, at the cost of slightly increasing
the time spent per operation, the CRAM can be extended to also support

Electrons obeying a power law with the exponential cutoff are assumed to be
injected in the blob for a limited time interval. The flare data of 2007 April
4 were used to determine the values of model parameters. The spectral energy
distribution of flare emission is explained by nonthermal synchrotron radiation
in the NIR and X-ray bands. The model light curves suggest that electron
acceleration is still underway during the rising phase of the flares. GeV
gamma-rays are also emitted by synchrotron self-Compton scattering, although
its luminosity is not strictly constrained by the current model. If the GeV

over the electron kinetic energy density. Observations in the GeV band will
clarify the origin of the blob.

used to test the hypothesis that the strong jet streams on Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune result from convection throughout the molecular envelopes.
Due to computational limitations, these simulations must adopt viscosities and
heat fluxes many orders of magnitude larger than the planetary values. Several
numerical investigations have identified trends for how the mean jet speed
varies with heat flux and viscosity, but no previous theories have been
advanced to explain these trends. Here, we show using simple arguments that if
convective release of potential energy pumps the jets and viscosity damps them,
the mean jet speeds split into two regimes. When the convection is weakly
nonlinear, the equilibrated jet speeds should scale approximately with F/nu,
where F is the convective heat flux and nu is the viscosity. When the
convection is strongly nonlinear, the jet speeds are faster and should scale
approximately as (F/nu)^{1/2}. We demonstrate how this regime shift can
naturally result from a shift in the behavior of the jet-pumping efficiency
with heat flux and viscosity. Moreover, the simulations hint at a third regime
where, at sufficiently small viscosities, the jet speed becomes independent of
the viscosity. We show based on mixing-length estimates that if such a regime
exists, mean jet speeds should scale as heat flux to the 1/4 power. Our
scalings provide a good match to the mean jet speeds obtained in previous
Boussinesq and anelastic, three-dimensional simulations of convection within
giant planets over a broad range of parameters. When extrapolated to the real
heat fluxes, these scalings suggest that the mass-weighted jet speeds in the
molecular envelopes of the giant planets are much weaker--by an order of
magnitude or more--than the speeds measured at cloud level.

The model developed for spatially uniform electric fields and current densities

densities of $10^{3}$ A/m$^2$, and electric field to gas density ratios $E/N =

the H$_\alpha$ emission is consistent with reactions among H$^+$, H$_2^+$,

density over eight orders of magnitude. The calculated ion energy distributions
agree satisfactorily with experiment for H$_2^+$ and H$_3^+$, but are only in

ranking is a least squares computation on a graph. The vertices are the
alternatives, and the edge values comprise the comparison data. The basic idea
is very simple and old: come up with values on vertices such that their
differences match the given edge data. Since an exact match will usually be
impossible, one settles for matching in a least squares sense. This formulation
was first described by Leake in 1976 for rankingfootball teams and appears as
an example in Professor Gilbert Strang's classic linear algebra textbook. If
one is willing to look into the residual a little further, then the problem
really comes alive, as shown effectively by the remarkable recent paper of
Jiang et al. With or without this twist, the humble least squares problem on
graphs has far-reaching connections with many current areas ofresearch. These
connections are to theoretical computer science (spectral graph theory, and
multilevel methods for graph Laplacian systems); numerical analysis (algebraic
multigrid, and finite element exterior calculus); other mathematics (Hodge
decomposition, and random clique complexes); and applications (arbitrage, and
ranking of sports teams). Not all of these connections are explored in this
paper, but many are. The underlying ideas are easy to explain, requiring only
the four fundamental subspaces from elementary linear algebra. One of our aims
is to explain these basic ideas and connections, to get researchers in many
fields interested in this topic. Another aim is to use our numerical
experiments for guidance on selecting methods and exposing the need for further
development.

globular clusters (GCs) owing to pollution by CNO cycled gas. Because of its
fragility Li is destroyed at the temperature at which the CNO cycling occurs,
and this makes Li a crucial study for the nature of the contaminating stars. We
observed 112 un-evolved stars at the Turnoff of the NGC6752 cluster with FLAMES
at the VLT to investigate the presence and the extent of a Li-O correlation.
This correlation is expected if there is a simple pollution scenario. Li (670.8
nm) and O triplet (771 nm) abundances are derived in NLTE. All stars belong to
a very narrow region of the color-magnitude diagram, so they have similar
stellar parameters (Teff, log g). We find that O and Li correlate, with a high
statistical significance that confirms the early results for this cluster. At
first glance this is what is expected if a simple pollution of pristine gas
with CNO cycled gas (O-poor, Li-poor) occurred. The slope of the relationship,
however, is about 0.4, and differs from unity by over 7 Sigma. A slope of one
is the value predicted for a pure contamination model. We confirm an extended
Li-O correlation in non evolved stars of NGC 6752. At the same time the
characteristic of the correlation shows that a simple pollution scenario is not
sufficient to explain the observations. Within this scenario the contaminant
gas must have been enriched in Li. This would rule out massive stars as main
polluters, and favor the hypothesis that the polluting gas was enriched by
intermediate or high-mass AGB stars, unless the former can be shown to be able
to produce Li. According to our observations, the fraction of polluting gas
contained in the stars observed is a considerable fraction of the stellar mass
of the cluster.

discrete quantities such as the position and the area of spectral peaks for
low-lying states. Moreover data accuracy can be improved by increasing the
number of basis functions. In this report, we first confirm our method in the
free quark case and show that our method works well. Then, we apply the method
to a quenched lattice QCD simulation and calculate the charmonium SPFs for S
and P-waves at zero temperature. Our results for the ground state are well
consistent with the position and the area of the lowest peaks of charmonium
SPFs calculated by the conventional maximum entropy method. For first excited
states, the signals may be reliablly extracted with our method because the
charmonium mass converges to a value close to the experimental one when the
number of basis functions is increased. We also investigate the SPFs for S-wave
charmonia at below and above $T_c$. Our results suggest that $J/\psi$ and
$\eta_c$ may survive up to 1.4$T_c$.

magnetic field the current is usually injected to the arm of the ring preferred
by classical magnetic forces. However, for narrow magnetic field intervals that
appear periodically on the magnetic field scale the current is injected to the
other arm of the ring. We indicate that the appearance of the anomalous --
non-classical -- current circulation results from Fano interference involving
localized resonant states. The identification of the Fano interference is based
on the comparison of the solution of the scattering problem with the results of
the stabilization method. The latter employs the bound-state type calculations
and allows to extract both the energy of metastable states localized within the
ring and the width of resonances by analysis of the energy spectrum of a finite
size system in function of its length. The Fano resonances involving states of
anomalous current circulation become extremely narrow on both magnetic field
and energy scales. This is consistent with the orientation of the Lorentz force
that tends to keep the electron within the ring and thus increases the lifetime
of the electron localization within the ring. Absence of periodic Fano
resonances in electron transfer probability through a quantum ring containing
an elastic scatterer is also explained.

been proposed recently. The literal understanding of the basic rule of quantum
mechanics on identical particles violates the cluster separation principle and
so leads to difficulties. A proposal due to Peres of how such difficulties
could be removed is reformulated and extended. Cluster separability leads to a
locality requirement on observables and to the key notion of separation status.
Separation status of a microsystem is shown to change in preparation and
registration processes. The indispensability of detectors plays an important
role. Changes of separation status are alterations of kinematic description
rather than some parts of dynamical trajectories and so more radical than
'collapse of the wave function'. Textbook quantum mechanics does not provide
any information of how separation status changes run, hence new rules must be
formulated. This enables to satisfy the objectification requirement for
registrations. To show how the ideas work, a simplified model of registration
apparatus is constructed.

We generated catalogs of UV sources from two GALEX's surveys: AIS (All-Sky

over 21,435/1,579 square degrees. We also constructed subcatalogs of the UV

contain 0.6/0.9million (AIS/MIS) sources with errors <0.3mag in both FUV and
NUV, excluding sources with multiple optical counterparts, over an area of
7,325/1,103 square degrees. All catalogs are available online. We then selected
28,319(AIS)/9,028(MIS) matched sources with FUV-NUV<-0.13; this color cut
corresponds to stellar Teff hotter than ~18,000 K. An additional color cut of
NUV-r>0.1 isolates binaries with largely differing Teff's, and some intruding
QSOs. Available spectroscopy for a subsample indicates that hot-star candidates
with NUV-r<0.1 have negligible contamination by non-stellar objects. We discuss
the distribution of sources in the catalogs, and the effects of error and color
cuts on the samples. The density of hot-star candidates increases from high to
low Galactic latitudes, but drops on the MW plane due to dust extinction. Our
hot-star counts at all latitudes are better matched by Milky Way models

compressed, due to both the wind interaction and the orbital motion. We use
MPI-AMRVAC to time-integrate the equations of hydrodynamics, combined with
optically thin radiative cooling, on an adaptive mesh 3D grid. Using parameters
for generic binary systems, we simulate the interaction between the winds of
the two stars. The WNL+O star binary shows a typical example of an adiabatic
wind collision. The resulting shell is thick and smooth, showing no
instabilities. On the other hand, the shell created by the collision of the O
star wind with the LBV wind, combined with the orbital motion of the binary
components, is susceptible to thin shell instabilities, which create a highly
structured morphology. We identify the nature of the instabilities as both
linear and non-linear thin-shell instabilities, with distinct differences
between the leading and the trailing parts of the collision front. We also find
that for binaries containing a star with a (relatively) slow wind, the global
shape of the shell is determined more by the slow wind velocity and the orbital
motion of the binary, than the ram pressure balance between the two winds. The
interaction between massive binary winds needs further parametric exploration,
to identify the role and dynamical importance of multiple instabilities at the
collision front, as shown here for an LBV+O star system.

another type of workload is run on the platform, scheduling and therefore

the approaches based on data mining, which are available in the literature. In

galaxies. We obtained a clear relation between the absorption column density
and the equivalent width of the 6.4 keV line above 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$,
suggesting a wide-ranging column density of $10^{23-24.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ with a
similar solid and a Fe abundance of 0.7--1.3 solar for Seyfert 2 galaxies. The
EW of the 6.4 keV line for Seyfert 1 galaxies are typically 40--120 eV,
suggesting the existence of Compton-thick matter like the torus with a column
density of $>10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a solid angle of $(0.15-0.4)*4pi$, and no
difference of neutral matter is visible between Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies. An
absorber with a lower column density of $10^{21-23}$ cm$^{-2}$ for Compton-thin
Seyfert 2 galaxies is suggested to be not a torus but an interstellar medium.
These constraints can be understood by the fact that the 6.4 keV line intensity
ratio against the 10--50 keV flux is almost identical within a range of 2--3 in
many Seyfert galaxies. Interestingly, objects exist with a low EW, 10--30 eV,
of the 6.4 keV line, suggesting that those torus subtends only a small solid
angle of $<0.2*4pi$. Ionized Fe-K$\alpha$ emission or absorption lines are
detected from several percents of AGNs. Considering the ionization state and
equivalent width, emitters and absorbers of ionized Fe-K lines can be explained
by the same origin, and highly ionized matter is located at the broad line
region. The rapid increase in EW of the ionized Fe-K emission lines at
$N_{H}>10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ is found, like that of the cold material. It is found
that these features seem to change for brighter objects with more than several
$10^{44}$ erg/s such that the Fe-K line features become weak. We discuss this
feature, together with the torus structure.

of both the surface activity and the weak-contact reconfigurations is observed
as a result of repeated tilt cycles up to a given angle smaller than the angle
of avalanche. For an aged configuration reached after several consecutive tilt
cycles, abrupt resumption of the on-surface activity and of the weak-contact

previous maximal tilting angle. This behavior is compared with literature
results from numerical simulations of inclined 2D packings. It is also found
that the aged weak-contact configurations exhibit spontaneous restoration
towards the initial state if the packing remains at rest for tens of minutes.

angles, instead of ageing, the weak-contact configuration exhibits ""internal
weak-contact avalanches"" in the vicinity of both the near-critical and zero

matched active and control galaxy samples plays an important role in studies of
the fueling of active galactic nuclei. We carry out a detailed morphological
characterization of a sample of 35 Seyfert galaxies and a matched sample of
inactive galaxies in order to compare the evidence of non-axisymmetric
perturbation of the potential and, in the second part of this paper, to be able
to perform a multicomponent photometric decomposition of the Seyfert galaxies.
We constructed contour maps, BVRcIc profiles of the surface brightness,
ellipticity, and position angle, as well as colour index profiles. We further
used colour index images, residual images, and structure maps, which helped
clarify the morphology of the galaxies. We studied the presence of close
companions using literature data. By straightening out the morphological status
of some of the objects, we derived an improved morphological classification and
built a solid basis for a further multicomponent decomposition of the Seyfert
sample. We report hitherto undetected (to our knowledge) structural components
in some Seyfert galaxies - a bar (Ark 479), an oval/lens (Mrk 595), rings (Ark
120, Mrk 376), a nuclear bar and ring (Mrk 352), and nuclear dust lanes (Mrk
590). We compared the large-scale morphology and local environment of the
Seyfert sample to those of the control one and found that (1) the two samples
show similar incidences of bars, rings, asymmetries, and close companions; (2)
the Seyfert bars are generally weaker than the bars of the control galaxies;
(3) the bulk of the two samples shows morphological evidence of
non-axisymmetric perturbations of the potential or close companions; (4) the
fueling of Seyfert nuclei is not directly related to the large-scale morphology
and local environment of their host galaxies.

as infinite products over roots of a certain transcendental equation, and the
density of the supremum process can be computed as an exponentially converging
infinite series. In several special cases when the roots can be found
analytically, we are able to identify the Wiener-Hopf factors and distribution
of the supremum in closed form. In the general case we prove that all the roots
are real and simple, and we provide localization results and asymptotic
formulas which allow an efficient numerical evaluation. We also derive a
convergence acceleration algorithm for infinite products and a simple and
efficient procedure to compute the Wiener-Hopf factors for complex values of
parameters. As a numerical example we discuss computation of the density of the

considerable interest is that of estimating the ""Transcription Regulation

genes can be observed, the activation levels of the corresponding TFs are
usually unknown, greatly increasing the difficulty of the problem. Based on
previous experimental work, it is often the case that partial information about
the TRN is available. For example, certain TFs may be known to regulate a given
gene or in other cases a connection may be predicted with a certain
probability. In general, the biology of the problem indicates there will be
very few connections between TFs and genes. Several methods have been proposed
for estimating TRNs. However, they all suffer from problems such as unrealistic
assumptions about prior knowledge of the network structure or computational
limitations. We propose a new approach that can directly utilize prior
information about the network structure in conjunction with observed gene
expression data to estimate the TRN. Our approach uses $L_1$ penalties on the
network to ensure a sparse structure. This has the advantage of being
computationally efficient as well as making many fewer assumptions about the
network structure. We use our methodology to construct the TRN for E. coli and
show that the estimate is biologically sensible and compares favorably with
previous estimates.

using recent relativistic MHD simulations of the Crab Nebula and also show that
the observed size, shape, and distance from the pulsar of the Crab Nebula inner
knot are consistent with its interpretation as a Doppler-boosted emission from
the termination shock. If the electrons responsible for the synchrotron
gamma-rays are accelerated only at the termination shock then their short
life-time ensures that these gamma-rays originate close to the shock and are
also strongly effected by the Doppler beaming. As the result, bulk of the
observed synchrotron gamma-rays of the Crab Nebula around 100 MeV may come from
its inner knot. This hypothesis is consistent with the observed optical flux of
the inner knot provided its optical-gamma spectral index is the same as the
injection spectral index found in the Kennel & Coroniti model of the nebula
spectrum. The observed variability of synchrotron gamma-ray emission can be
caused by the instability of the termination shock discovered in recent
numerical simulations. Given the small size of the knot, it is possible that
the September 2010 gamma-ray flare of the Crab Nebula also came from the knot,
though the actual mechanism remains unclear. The model predicts correlation of
the temporal variability of the synchrotron gamma-ray flux in the Fermi and
AGILE windows with the variability of the unpulsed optical flux from within 1
arcsec of the Crab pulsar.

photon flux and a high efficiency. Paying tribute to various attempts to
maximise the single photon flux we show that collection efficiencies of photons
from colour centres can be increased with a rather simple experimental setup.
To do so we spin-coated nanodiamonds containing single nitrogen-vacancy colour
centres on the flat surface of a ZrO2 solid immersion lens. We found stable
single photon count rates of up to 853 kcts/s at saturation under continuous
wave excitation while having excess to more than 100 defect centres with count

count rates up to 2.4 Mcts/s for time intervals of several ten seconds. It
seems to be a general feature that very high rates are accompanied by a
blinking behaviour. The overall collection efficiency of our setup of up to
4.2% is the highest yet reported for N-V defect centres in diamond. Under
pulsed excitation of a stable emitter of 10 MHz, 2.2% of all pulses caused a

suppression of all spatial Fourier modes having wavenumbers in excess of a
threshold $K_G$ exhibit unexpected features. The study is carried out for both
the one-dimensional Burgers equation and the two-dimensional incompressible
Euler equation. For large $K_G$ and smooth initial conditions, the first
symptom of truncation, a localized short-wavelength oscillation which we call a
""tyger"", is caused by a resonant interaction between fluid particle motion and
truncation waves generated by small-scale features (shocks, layers with strong
vorticity gradients, etc). Tygers appear when complex-space singularities come
within one Galerkin wavelength $\lambdag = 2\pi/K_G$ from the real domain and
arise far away from preexisting small-scale structures at locations whose
velocities match that of such structures. Tygers are weak and strongly
localized at first - in the Burgers case at the time of appearance of the first
shock their amplitudes and widths are proportional to $K_G^{-2/3}$ and $K_G
^{-1/3}$ respectively - but grow and eventually invade the whole flow. They are
thus the first manifestations of the thermalization predicted by T.D. Lee in
1952.
  The sudden dissipative anomaly - the presence of a finite dissipation in the
limit of vanishing viscosity after a finite time $t_\star$ -, which is well
known for the Burgers equation and sometimes conjectured for the 3D Euler
equation, has as counterpart, in the truncated case, the ability of tygers to
store a finite amount of energy in the limit $K_G\to\infty$. This leads to
Reynolds stresses acting on scales larger than the Galerkin wavelength and
prevents the flow from converging to the inviscid-limit solution. There are
indications that it may eventually be possible to purge the tygers and thereby
to recover the correct inviscid-limit behavior.

so its safe and reliable operation is of major concern. State estimators are
commonly used in power networks, for example, to detect faulty equipment and to
optimally route power flows. The estimators are often located in control
centers, to which large numbers of measurements are sent over unencrypted
communication channels. Therefore cyber security for state estimators becomes
an important issue. In this paper we analyze the cyber security of state
estimators in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) for energy
management systems (EMS) operating the power network. Current EMS state
estimation algorithms have bad data detection (BDD) schemes to detect outliers
in the measurement data. Such schemes are based on high measurement redundancy.
Although these methods may detect a set of basic cyber attacks, they may fail
in the presence of an intelligent attacker. We explore the latter by
considering scenarios where stealthy deception attacks are performed by sending
false information to the control center. We begin by presenting a recent
framework that characterizes the attack as an optimization problem with the
objective specified through a security metric and constraints corresponding to
the attack cost. The framework is used to conduct realistic experiments on a
state-of-the-art SCADA EMS software for a power network example with 14
substations, 27 buses, and 40 branches. The results indicate how state
estimators for power networks can be made more resilient to cyber security

and the direction of the so-called critical Casimir force - which is generated
by the enhanced thermal fluctuations close to a continuous phase transition -
can be controlled and reversibly modified to an uncommonly large extent. In
particular, minute temperature changes of the fluid solvent, which provides the
near-critical thermal fluctuations, lead to a significant change of the range
and strength of the effective interaction among the solute particles. This
feature allows one to control, e.g., the aggregation of colloidal dispersions
or the spatial distribution of colloids in the presence of chemically or
topographically patterned substrates. The spatial direction of the effective
force acting on a solute particle depends only on the surface properties of the
immersed particles and can be spatially modulated by suitably patterned
surfaces. These critical Casimir forces are largely independent of the specific
materials properties of both the solvent and the confining surfaces. This
characteristic universality of critical phenomena allows systematic and
quantitative theoretical studies of the critical Casimir forces in terms of
suitable representative and simplified models. Here we highlight recent
theoretical and experimental advances concerning critical Casimir forces with a
particular emphasis on the numerous possibilities of controlling these forces
