multiple matching on strings in the word RAM model with word length w. In the
first problem, we have to build a data structure based on a pattern p of length
m over an alphabet of size sigma such that we can answer to the following
query: given a text T of length n, where each character is encoded using
log(sigma) bits return the positions of all the occurrences of p in T (in the
following we refer by occ to the number of reported occurrences). For the
multi-pattern matching problem we have a set S of d patterns of total length m
and a query on a text T consists in finding all positions of all occurrences in
T of the patterns in S. As each character of the text is encoded using log
sigma bits and we can read w bits in constant time in the RAM model, we assume
that we can read up to (w/log sigma) consecutive characters of the text in one
time step. This implies that the fastest possible query time for both problems
is O((n(log sigma/w)+occ). In this paper we present several different results
for both problems which come close to that best possible query time. We first
present two different linear space data structures for the first and second
problem: the first one answers to single pattern matching queries in time
O(n(1/m+log sigma/w)+occ) while the second one answers to multiple pattern
matching queries to O(n((log d+log y+log log d)/y+log sigma/w)+occ) where y is
the length of the shortest pattern in the case of multiple pattern-matching. We
then show how a simple application of the four russian technique permits to get
data structures with query times independent of the length of the shortest
pattern (the length of the only pattern in case of single string matching) at
the expense of using more space.

non-linear Fourier Galerkin method with an additional spectral viscosity term.
This type of approximation was first introduced by Tadmor for pure conservation
laws. We prove that this {\em non-monotone} method converges to the entropy
solution of the problem, that it retains the spectral accuracy of the Fourier
method, and that it diagonalizes the fractional term reducing dramatically the
computational cost induced by this term. We also derive a robust $L^1$-error
estimate, and provide numerical experiments for the fractional Burgers'

retrogradely precess by tidal torques like the Moon and the Sun on a tilted,

the precessional value. For example, a Cataclysmic Variable (CV) Dwarf Novae
(DN) non-magnetic system that shows negative superhumps in its light curve can
be described by a retrogradely precessing, differentially rotating, tilted
disc. Because the disc is a fluid and because the gas stream overflows the
tilted disc and particles can migrate into inner disc annuli, coupled to the
disc could be a retrogradely precessing inner ring that is located near the
innermost annuli of the disc. However, numerical simulations by Bisikalo et al.
(2003, 2004) and this work show that an inner spiral density wave can be
generated instead of an inner ring. Therefore, we show that retrograde
precession in non-magnetic, spinning, tilted CV DN systems can equally be
described by a retrogradely precessing and differentially rotating disc with an
attached retrogradely precessing inner spiral density wave so long as the wave
appears at the same radius as the ring and within the plane of the tilted disc.
We find that the theoretical results generated in this work agree well with the
theoretical results presented in Montgomery (2009a) and thus with the numerical
simulations and select CV DN systems in Montgomery (2009b) that may have a main
sequence secondary. Therefore, pressure effects do need to be considered in CV
DN systems that exhibit negative superhumps if the accretion discs are tilted
and have an inner spiral density wave that is in the plane of the disc.

high-metallicity material does not remain in the surface layers, as often
assumed, but is diluted into the interior through fingering (thermohaline)
convection. Until now, however, the timescale over which this process happens
remained very poorly constrained. Using recently-measured turbulent mixing
rates for fingering convection, I provide reliable numerical and
semi-analytical estimates for the rate at which the added heavy elements drain
into the interior. I find that the relative metallicity enhancement post-infall
drops by a factor of ten over a timescale which depends only on the structure
of the host star, and decreases very rapidly with increasing stellar mass (from
about 1Gyr for a 1.3M_sun star to 10Myr for a 1.5M_sun star). This result
offers an elegant explanation to the lack of observed trend between metallicity
and convection zone mass in planet-bearing stars. More crucially, it strongly
suggests that the statistically-higher metallicity of planet-bearing stars must
be of primordial origin. Finally, the fingering region is found to extend
deeply into the star, a result which would provide a simple theoretical
explanation to the measurements of higher lithium depletion rates in
planet-bearing stars.

that the early ingress in the UV light curve of WASP-12b, compared to the
optical observations, is caused by a shock around the planet, and that shocks
should be a common feature in transiting systems. Here, we classify all the
transiting systems known to date according to their potential for producing
shocks that could cause observable light curve asymmetries. We found that 36/92
of known transiting systems would lie above a reasonable detection threshold
and that the most promising candidates to present shocks are: WASP-19b,
WASP-4b, WASP-18b, CoRoT-7b, HAT-P-7b, CoRoT-1b, TrES-3, and WASP-5b. For
prograde planets orbiting outside the co-rotation radius of fast rotating
stars, the shock position, instead of being ahead of the planetary motion as in
WASP-12b, trails the planet. In this case, we predict that the light curve of
the planet should present a late-egress asymmetry. We show that CoRoT-11b is a
potential candidate to host such a behind shock and show a late egress. If
observed, these asymmetries can provide constraints on planetary magnetic
fields. For instance, for a planet that has a magnetic field intensity similar
to Jupiter's field (~ 14 G) orbiting a star whose magnetic field is between 1
and 100G, the stand-off distance between the shock and the planet, which we
take to be the size of the planet's magnetosphere, ranges from 1 to 40
planetary radii.

departure from thermodynamical equilibrium. The methods rely on the
introduction of buffer zones which realize a smooth transition between the
kinetic and the fluid regions. In this paper we extend the idea of buffer zones
and dynamic coupling to the case of the Monte Carlo methods. To facilitate the
coupling and avoid the onset of spurious oscillations in the fluid regions
which are consequences of the coupling with a stochastic numerical scheme, we
use a new technique which permits to reduce the variance of the particle
methods [11]. In addition, the use of this method permits to obtain estimations
of the breakdowns of the fluid models less affected by fluctuations and
consequently to reduce the kinetic regions and optimize the coupling. In the
last part of the paper several numerical examples are presented to validate the
method and measure its computational performances.

cluster catalogs up to redshift 1 or beyond and down to $10^{13.5}$ solar
masses is paramount especially in light of upcoming surveys aiming at
cosmological constraints from galaxy cluster number counts. We build the VT in
photometric redshift shells and use the two-point correlation function of the
galaxies in the field to both determine the density threshold for detection of
cluster candidates and to establish their significance. This allows us to
detect clusters in a self consistent way without any assumptions about their
astrophysical properties. We apply the VT to mock catalogs which extend to
redshift 1.4 reproducing the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and the clustering
properties observed in the SDSS data. An objective estimate of the cluster
selection function in terms of the completeness and purity as a function of
mass and redshift is as important as having a reliable cluster finder. We
measure these quantities by matching the VT cluster catalog with the mock truth
table. We show that the VT can produce a cluster catalog with completeness and
purity $>80%$ for the redshift range up to $\sim 1$ and mass range down to
$\sim 10^{13.5}$ solar masses.

for folding and unfolding are found to be highly salt-specific. In particular,
the folding times increase about one order of magnitude for the sodium salts.
The drastic slowing down can be traced back to long-lived, compact

tightly bound by several carbonyl and carboxylate groups. This multiple
trapping is found to lead to a non-exponential residence time distribution of
the cations in the first solvation shell of the peptide. The analysis of
{\alpha}-helical folding in the framework of diffusion in a reduced

specifically modifies equilibrium properties, but also induces kinetic barriers
due to individual ion binding. In the sodium salts, for instance, the peptide's
configurational mobility (or ""diffusivity"") can decrease about one order of
magnitude. This study demonstrates the highly specific action of ions and

since it provides the most accurate proportionality between hop-count and
Euclidean distance. Hence, it can be used for GPS-free node localisation as
well as minimum distance packet forwarding. It is also known to be
asymptotically optimal for network transport capacity and power efficiency. In
this context, we propose DISCRIT, a distributed and asynchronous algorithm for

not require the knowledge of node locations or internode distances, nor does it
require pair-wise RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) measurements to be

planetary systems form. Intepretation of these data demands an astrophysical
model, and the ""X-wind"" model of Shu et al. (1996) and collaborators has been
advanced to explain the origin of chondrules, CAIs and SLRs. It posits that
chondrules and CAIs were thermally processed < 0.1 AU from the protostar, then
flung by a magnetocentrifugal outflow to the 2-3 AU region to be incorporated
into chondrites. Here we critically examine key assumptions and predictions of
the X-wind model. We find a number of internal inconsistencies: theory and
observation show no solid material exists at 0.1 AU; particles at 0.1 AU cannot
escape being accreted into the star; particles at 0.1 AU will collide at speeds
high enough to destroy them; thermal sputtering will prevent growth of
particles; and launching of particles in magnetocentrifugal outflows is not
modeled, and may not be possible. We also identify a number of incorrect
predictions of the X-wind model: the oxygen fugacity where CAIs form is orders
of magnitude too oxidizing; chondrule cooling rates are orders of magnitude
lower than those experienced by barred olivine chondrules; chondrule-matrix
complementarity is not predicted; and the SLRs are not produced in their
observed proportions. We conclude that the X-wind model is not relevant to
chondrule and CAI formation and SLR production. We discuss more plausible
models for chondrule and CAI formation and SLR production.

that suffer frequent eruptions. In the last few years, these stars have been
proposed as the direct progenitors of some core-collapse supernovae (SNe),
particularly Type IIn SNe, in conflict with stellar evolution theory. In this
paper we investigate various scenarios wherein LBV stars have been suggested as
the immediate progenitors of SNe. Many of these suggestions stem from the fact
that the SNe appear to be expanding in a high density medium, which has been
interpreted as resulting from a wind with a high mass-loss rate. Others arise
due to perceived similarities between the SN characteristics and those of LBVs.
Only in the case of SN 2005gl do we find a valid possibility for an LBV-like
progenitor. Other scenarios encounter various levels of difficulty. The
evidence that points to LBVs as direct core-collapse SNe progenitors is far
from convincing. High mass-loss rates are often deduced by making assumptions
regarding the wind parameters, which are contradicted by the results
themselves. A high density need not necessarily imply a high wind mass-loss
rate: wind shocks sweeping up the surrounding medium may give a high density
shell with a low associated wind mass-loss rate. High densities may also arise
due to wind clumps, or due to a previous LBV phase before the SN explodes as a
Wolf-Rayet star. Some Type IIn SNe appear to signify more a phase in the life
of a SN than a class of SNe, and may arise from more than one type of
progenitor. A Wolf-Rayet phase that lasts for a few thousand years or less
could be one of the more probable progenitors of Type IIns, and channels for
creating short-lived W-R phases are briefly discussed.

theories in the same way that symmetry-breaking phases of matter are described

the two-dimensional topological insulator or quantum spin Hall state, this
description is essentially equivalent to a pair of Chern-Simons theories,
consistent with the realization of this phase as paired integer quantum Hall
effect states. The $BF$ description can be motivated from the local excitations
produced when a $\pi$ flux is threaded through this state. For the
three-dimensional topological insulator, the $BF$ description is less obvious
but quite versatile: it contains a gapless surface Dirac fermion when
time-reversal-symmetry is preserved and yields ""axion electrodynamics"", i.e.,
an electromagnetic $E \cdot B$ term, when time-reversal symmetry is broken and
the surfaces are gapped. Just as changing the coefficients and charges of 2D
Chern-Simons theory allows one to obtain fractional quantum Hall states
starting from integer states, $BF$ theory could also describe (at a macroscopic
level) fractional 3D topological insulators with fractional statistics of
point-like and line-like objects.

whose rotation curve data points extend well beyond the optical disk. With no
free parameters other than galactic mass to light ratios, the theory is able to
account for the systematics that is observed in this entire set of rotation
curves without the need for any dark matter at all. In previous applications of
the theory a central role was played by a universal linear potential term
$V(r)=\gamma_0 c^2r/2$ that is generated through the effect of cosmology on
individual galaxies, with the coefficient $\gamma_0=3.06\times 10^{-30} {\rm
cm}^{-1}$ being of cosmological magnitude. Because the current sample is so big
and encompasses some specific galaxies whose data points go out to quite
substantial distances from galactic centers, we are able to identify an
additional globally induced universal term in the data, a quadratic
$V(r)=-\kappa c^2r^2/2$ term that is induced by inhomogeneities in the cosmic
background. With $\kappa$ being found to be of magnitude $\kappa=9.54\times
10^{-54} {\rm cm}^{-2}$, through study of the motions of particles contained
within galaxies we are thus able to both detect the presence of a global de
Sitter-like component and provide a specific value for its strength. Our study
suggests that invoking dark matter may be nothing more than an attempt to
describe global physics effects such as these in purely local galactic terms.

of this strategy is throughput reduction. To analyze the throughput loss, we
model coding over generations with random generation scheduling as a coupon

out to generically not be well-posed. A generic normalizable state will evolve
in such a way to violate Lifshitz asymptotics in finite time. Conversely,
enforcing the desired asymptotics at all times puts strong restrictions not

illustrate how extreme they are. The LSN hosts appear to favor low-density

low luminosity end. From the UV-optical photometry, we estimate the star
formation history of the LSN hosts. The hosts have moderately low star
formation rates (SFRs) and low stellar masses (M_*) resulting in high specific
star formation rates (sSFR). Compared with the larger sample, the LSN hosts
occupy low-density regions of a diagram plotting sSFR versus M_* in the area

implies the LSNe are produced by an effect having to do with their local
environment. The correlation of mass with metallicity suggests that perhaps
wind-driven mass loss is the factor that prevents LSNe from arising in
higher-mass, higher-metallicity hosts. The massive progenitors of the LSNe

find 10 of the 30 XRT-detected sources are clearly stellar in nature, including
one periodic variable star and 2 high proper motion stars. For 11 sources we
propose an AGN classification, among which 4 are detected with BAT and 3 have
redshifts spanning z = 0.2 - 0.9 obtained from the literature or from optical
spectroscopy presented here. The 67 Slew Survey sources we do not detect with
Swift are studied via their characteristics in the Slew Survey and by
comparison with the XRT and BAT detected population. We suggest that these are
mostly if not all extragalactic, though unlikely to be highly absorbed sources
in the X-rays such as Compton thick AGN. A large number of these are highly
variable soft X-ray sources. A small fraction of mainly hard-band detections
may be spurious. This follow-up programme brings us a step further to
completing the identifications of a substantial sample of XMM-Newton Slew
Survey sources, important for understanding the nature of the transient sky and
allowing flux-limited samples to be constructed.

rotor model has an unbounded spectrum from above, it has many more eigenstates

lowest energy. We classify three distinct physical limits of the rotor model:
the Rabi, Josephson, and Fock regimes. The last regime corresponds to a
fragmented condensate and is thus not captured by the Bogoliubov theory. We
next consider the semiclassical limit of the rotor problem and make connections
with the quantum wave functions through use of the Husimi distribution

from the most massive and violent merging sequences occurred in the Universe.
However, the role of wet, mixed, and dry major mergers in the assembly of mETGs
is questioned by some recent observations. We have developed a semi-analytical
model to test the feasibility of the major-merger origin hypothesis for mETGs,
just accounting for the effects on galaxy evolution of the major mergers
strictly reported by observations. The model proves that it is feasible to
reproduce the observed number density evolution of mETGs since z~1, just
accounting for the coordinated effects of wet/mixed/dry major mergers. It can
also reconcile the different assembly redshifts derived by hierarchical models
and by mass downsizing data for mETGs, just considering that a mETG observed at
a certain redshift is not necessarily in place since then. The model predicts
that wet major mergers have controlled the mETGs buildup since z~1, although
dry and mixed mergers have also played an essential role in it. The bulk of
this assembly took place at 0.7<z<1, being nearly frozen at z<~0.7 due to the
negligible number of major mergers occurred per existing mETG since then. The
model suggests that major mergers have been the main driver for the
observational migration of mass from the massive end of the blue galaxy cloud
to that of the red sequence in the last ~8 Gyr.

breaking (CSB) through a gap equation. We argue that entropic effects cut off
infrared singularities in the standard confining effective propagator $1/p^4$,
which should be replaced by $1/(p^2+m^2)^2$ for a finite mass $m\sim K_F/M(0)$
[$M(0)$ is the zero-momentum value of the running quark mass]. Extension of an
old calculation of the author yields a specific estimate for $m$. This cutoff
propagator shows semi-quantitatively two critical properties of confinement: 1)
a negative contribution to the confining potential coming from entropic forces;
2) an infrared cutoff required by gauge invariance and CSB itself. Entropic
effects lead to a proliferation of pion branches and a $\bar{q}q$ condensate,
and contribute a negative term $\sim -K_F/M(0)$ to the effective pion
Hamiltonian allowing for a massless pion in the presence of positive kinetic
energy and string energy. The resulting gap equation leads to a well-behaved
running constituent quark mass $M(p^2)$ with $M^2(0)\approx K_F/\pi$. We
include one-gluon terms to get the correct renormalization-group ultraviolet
behavior, with the improvement that the prefactor (related to $<\bar{q}q>$) can
be calculated from the confining solution. We discuss an integrability
condition that guarantees the absence of IR singularities at $m=0$ in Minkowski

burst spectrum is modeled by a single power-law (PL) with a photon index
Gamma=3.2$^{+1.8}_{-1.0}$, and has a fluence of
1.1$^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$$\times$10$^{-8}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$, luminosity of

quiescent spectrum obtained with the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) is best-fit by
an absorbed PL model with Gamma=2.6$\pm$0.2 and an unabsorbed flux of
9.1$^{+1.2}_{-1.4}$$\times$10$^{-11}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. To investigate
the pre-burst 0.5-10 keV persistent emission, we analyzed the archival
XMM-Newton observations and the spectra are well fitted by a two-component
blackbody (BB) plus PL model with a temperature kT=0.45$\pm$0.03 keV,
Gamma=1.9$\pm$0.2, and an unabsorbed flux of
4.3$^{+0.9}_{-1.2}$$\times$10$^{-11}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Comparing the
Swift-XRT spectrum with the XMM-Newton spectrum, spectral softening post-burst
is evident with a 2.1 times increase in the unabsorbed flux. We discuss the

self-gravitating shearing sheets, with application to QSO accretion disks at a
few thousand Schwarzschild radii, corresponding to a few hundredths of a parsec
for a 10^8 solar-mass black hole. Radiation pressure and optically thick
radiative cooling are implemented via vertical averages. We determine
dimensionless versions of the maximum surface density, accretion rate, and
effective viscosity that can be sustained by density-wave turbulence without
fragmentation. Where fragments do form, we study the final masses that result.
The maximum Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter is approximately 0.4.
Fragmentation occurs when the cooling time is less than about twice the
shearing time, as found by Gammie and others, but can also occur at very long
cooling times in sheets that are strongly radiation-pressure dominated. For
accretion at the Eddington rate onto a 10^8 solar-mass black hole,
fragmentation occurs beyond four thousand Schwarzschild radii, r_s. Near this
radius, initial fragment masses are several hundred suns, consistent with
estimates from linear stability; final masses after merging increase with the
size of the sheet, reaching several thousand suns in our largest simulations.
With increasing black-hole mass at a fixed Eddington ratio, self-gravity
prevails to smaller multiples of r_s, where radiation pressure is more
important and the cooling time is longer compared to the dynamical time;
nevertheless, fragmentation can occur and produces larger initial fragment
masses. We also find energy conservation is likely to be a challenge for all
eulerian codes in self-gravitating regimes where radiation pressure dominates.

bipolar outflows. Polarimetry can provide important information about the
physical structure of complex systems; in fact, the discovery of bipolar
outflows in beta Lyrae was confirmed through polarimetry. Here we present

data units transmitted on a shared protection path. This guarantees
instantaneous recovery of data units upon the failure of a working circuit. The
strategy can be implemented at an overlay layer, which makes its deployment
simple and scalable. While the proposed strategy is similar in spirit to the
work of Kamal '07 & '10, there are significant differences. In particular, it
provides protection against multiple link failures. The new scheme is simpler,
less expensive, and does not require the synchronization required by the
original scheme. The sharing of the protection circuit by a number of
connections is the key to the reduction of the cost of protection. The paper
also conducts a comparison of the cost of the proposed scheme to the 1+1 and

star formation and not active galactic nuclei (AGN). The rest have a
substantial hot dust component that one would expect from an AGN or an extreme

although the number of sources with sub-mm detections or meaningful upper

Two of the counterparts with PAHs are mixed sources, with PAH line-to-continuum

many domains, including document and Web data mining, bioinformatics, and image

smaller, incomplete and noisy structure fragments. In this work, we present an
unsupervised probabilistic approach that extends affinity propagation to
combine the small ontological fragments into a collection of integrated,
consistent, and larger folksonomies. This is a challenging task because the
method must aggregate similar structures while avoiding structural
inconsistencies and handling noise. We validate the approach on a real-world
social media dataset, comprised of shallow personal hierarchies specified by
many individual users, collected from the photosharing website Flickr. Our
empirical results show that our proposed approach is able to construct deeper
and denser structures, compared to an approach using only the standard affinity
propagation algorithm. Additionally, the approach yields better overall
integration quality than a state-of-the-art approach based on incremental
relational clustering.

transported energy, moving faster than individual weather systems, will affect
the development of the next meteorological system on the leading edge of the
wave packet, creating a chain of connections between systems that can be far
apart in time and space, with important implications on predictability. In this
work we present an automated recognition of atmospheric wave packets which
allows the extraction of all the relevant properties, such as location,
duration and velocity. Behind this tool lies the need to investigate
atmospheric variability in its full complexity, bridging the low-frequency

clear minimum of activity in summer. Preferential areas of genesis are shown to

function that captures the details of the microscopic dynamics of the cascades.
We show that this function can also be used to compute the macroscopic
properties of cascades, such as their size, spread, diameter, number of paths,
and average path length. We present an algorithm to efficiently compute cascade
generating function and demonstrate that while significantly compressing
information within a cascade, it nevertheless allows us to accurately
reconstruct its structure. We use this framework to study information dynamics
on the social network of Digg. Digg allows users to post and vote on stories,
and easily see the stories that friends have voted on. As a story spreads on
Digg through voting, it generates cascades. We extract cascades of more than
3,500 Digg stories and calculate their macroscopic and microscopic properties.
We identify several trends in cascade dynamics: spreading via chaining,
branching and community. We discuss how these affect the spread of the story
through the Digg social network. Our computational framework is general and
offers a practical solution to quantitative analysis of the microscopic
structure of even very large cascades.

Methods. The three regions S255IR, S255N and S255S were observed at 1.3 mm with
the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and followup short spacing information was
obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope. Near infrared (NIR) H + K-band spectra
and continuum observations were taken for S255IR with VLT-SINFONI to study the
different stellar populations in this region. The combination of millimeter
(mm) and near infrared data allow us to characterize different stellar
populations within the young forming cluster in detail. While we find multiple
mm continuum sources toward all regions, their outflow, disk and chemical
properties vary considerably. The most evolved source S255IR exhibits a
collimated bipolar outflow visible in CO and H2 emission, the outflows from the
youngest region S255S are still small and rather confined in the regions of the
mm continuum peaks. Also the chemistry toward S255IR is most evolved exhibiting
strong emission from complex molecules, while much fewer molecular lines are
detected in S255N, and in S255S we detect only CO isotopologues and SO lines.
Also, rotational structures are found toward S255N and S255IR. Furthermore, a

a ""complicated"" family of index models I in K_1 we build many and/or
complicated structures in a class K_2. The index models are characteristically
linear orders, trees with kappa+1 levels (possibly with linear order on the set
of successors of a member) and linearly ordered graph, for this we phrase
relevant complicatedness properties (called bigness).
  We say when M in K_2 is represented in I in K_1. We give sufficient
conditions when {M_I:I\in K^1_\lambda} is complicated where for each I in
K^1_lambda we build M_I in K^2 (usually in K^2_lambda) represented in it and
reflecting to some degree its structure (e.g. for I a linear order we can build
a model of an unstable first order class reflecting the order). If we
understand enough we can even build e.g. rigid members of K^2_lambda.
  Note that we mention ""stable"", ""superstable"", but in a self contained way,
using an equivalent definition which is useful here and explicitly given. We
also frame the use of generalizations of Ramsey and Erdos-Rado theorems to get
models in which any I from the relevant K_1 is reflected. We give in some
detail how this may apply to the class of separable reduced Abelian p-group and
how we get relevant models for ordered graphs (via forcing).
  In the third section we show stronger results concerning linear orders. If
for each linear order I of cardinality lambda>aleph_0 we can attach a model M_I
in K_lambda in which the linear order can be embedded so that for enough cuts
of I, their being omitted is reflected in M_I, then there are 2^lambda
non-isomorphic cases.

was found to heighten the diffusion potential barrier, while hole doping lowers
it. However, both kinds of dopings heighten the desorption potential barrier.
The underlying mechanism was revealed by investigating the effect of doping on
the bond strength of graphene and on the electron transfer and the coulomb
interaction between the hydrogen monomer and graphene. The kinetic properties
of H and D monomers on doped graphene layers during both the annealing process
(annealing time $t_0 =$300 s) and the constant-rate heating process (heating
rate $\alpha =$1.0 K/s) were simulated. Both electron and hole dopings were
found to generally increase the desorption temperatures of hydrogen monomers.
Electron doping was found to prevent the diffusion of hydrogen monomers, while
the hole doping enhances their diffusion. Macroscopic diffusion of hydrogen
monomers on graphene can be achieved when the doping-hole density reaches
$5.0\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. The magnetic moment and exchange splitting were
found to be reduced by both electron and hole dopings, which was explained by a
simple exchange model. The study in this report can further enhance the
understanding of the interaction between hydrogen and graphene and is expected
to be helpful in the design of hydrogenated-graphene-based devices.

as projection or fractional step methods, have limited temporal accuracy as a
result of matrix splitting errors, or introduce errors near the domain
boundaries (which destroy uniform convergence to the solution). In this paper
we recast the incompressible (constant density) Navier-Stokes equations (with
the velocity prescribed at the boundary) as an equivalent system, for the
primary variables velocity and pressure. We do this in the usual way away from
the boundaries, by replacing the incompressibility condition on the velocity by
a Poisson equation for the pressure. The key difference from the usual
approaches occurs at the boundaries, where we use boundary conditions that
unequivocally allow the pressure to be recovered from knowledge of the velocity
at any fixed time. This avoids the common difficulty of an, apparently,
over-determined Poisson problem. Since in this alternative formulation the
pressure can be accurately and efficiently recovered from the velocity, the
recast equations are ideal for numerical marching methods. The new system can
be discretized using a variety of methods, in principle to any desired order of
accuracy. In this work we illustrate the approach with a 2-D second order
finite difference scheme on a Cartesian grid, and devise an algorithm to solve
the equations on domains with curved (non-conforming) boundaries, including a
case with a non-trivial topology (a circular obstruction inside the domain).
This algorithm achieves second order accuracy (in L-infinity), for both the
velocity and the pressure. The scheme has a natural extension to 3-D.

can be described much nicer, and with way less inequalities, by projections of
higher dimensional polyhedra than this would be possible in the original space.
However, currently not many general tools to construct such extended
formulations are available. In this paper, we develop a framework of polyhedral
relations that generalizes inductive constructions of extended formulations via
projections, and we particularly elaborate on the special case of reflection
relations. The latter ones provide polynomial size extended formulations for
several polytopes that can be constructed as convex hulls of the unions of
(exponentially) many copies of an input polytope obtained via sequences of
reflections at hyperplanes. We demonstrate the use of the framework by deriving
small extended formulations for the G-permutahedra of all finite reflection
groups G (generalizing both Goeman's extended formulation of the permutahedron
of size O(n log n) and Ben-Tal and Nemirovski's extended formulation with O(k)

hot water sometimes overtakes as they cool, has been highlighted recently. In
the extensively studied colossal magnetoresistance manganites, cooling in a
magnetic field (H) often results in an inhomogeneous mixture of transformed
equilibrium phase and a kinetically arrested non-equilibrium phase which
relaxes slowly towards equilibrium at fixed H and temperature (T). Here we show
that the magnetization decay rate at the same H and T is larger for the state
that was initially farther from equilibrium, and it continues to relax faster
even after these have become equal. Our result should help propose an
explanation, for Mpemba effect, that does not attribute it to any artifact.

characterizes the strength of the nonlinearity of the quantum system. We show
that, the corresponding \beta-states possess a collection of non-classicality
features, only for the particular values of \beta and z. But, interestingly
there exists finite (threshold) values of \beta, for which all of the

threshold (or greater) value of \beta, the corresponding \beta-states behave
very similar to canonical coherent states, as the most classical quantum
states, in approximately whole of the space. In the continuation, we motivate
to find another class of nonlinear coherent states, limited to a unit disk
centered at the origin, looking like the canonical coherent states in behavior,
in exactly the whole range of |z| < 1. This purpose also will be achieved by
considering the nonlinearity function as f(n)= exp(\lambda/n)/\sqrt{n}, where
\lambda is a tunable nonlinearity parameter. The canonical coherent state's

cases, working with a threshold (or greater) value of \lambda.

we explore a reparameterization which exploits the asymptotic theory of
normalizing constants required for nondegenerate limit distributions. Inference
is carried out in a Bayesian setting, an advantage of this being the
availability of posterior predictive return levels. The methodology is
illustrated on both simulated data and significant wave height data from the

the mass should better originate from certain higher dimensional operators. The
conventional three types of seesaw operate at dimension five with the help of
either a new fermion or scalar multiplet. Here we propose a seesaw that
generates neutrino mass through a dimension-(5+4n) operator. The seesaw is
functioned by a fermion of isospin n+1 and zero hypercharge and a sequence of
scalar multiplets that share unity hypercharge but have isospin from 3/2 to
n+1/2 at a step of unity. Only the scalar of the highest isospin can couple to
the relevant fermions while only the scalar of the lowest isospin can directly
develop a naturally small vacuum expectation value (VEV). The VEV is then
transmitted to scalars of higher isospin through a cascading process. No global
symmetry is required to forbid lower dimensional operators. A neutrino mass of
desired order can thus be induced with a relatively low seesaw scale without
demanding too small couplings.

Maxwell[1]. Since then, technology has developed, and today a variety of

electromagnetic oscillations atoms in cavities can be used to couple electric
fields[2, 3]. For mechanical oscillators realized, for example, with
cantilevers[4, 5] or vibrational modes of trapped atoms[6] or ions[7, 8], a
quantum mechanical link between two such oscillators has, to date, been
demonstrated in very few cases and has only been achieved in indirect ways.
Examples of this include the mechanical transport of atoms carrying the quantum
information[9] or the use of spontaneously emitted photons[10]. In this work,
direct coupling between the motional dipoles of separately trapped ions is
achieved over a distance of 54 {\mu}m, using the dipole-dipole interaction as a
quantum-mechanical transmission line[11]. This interaction is small between
single trapped ions, but the coupling is amplified by using additional trapped
ions as antennae. With three ions in each well the interaction is increased by
a factor of seven as compared to the singleion case. This enhancement
facilitates bridging of larger distances and relaxes the constraints on the
miniaturization of trap electrodes. This represents a new building block for
quantum computation and also offers new opportunities to couple quantum systems
of different natures.

spectrum with models we show that parity doublets observed in the mass spectra
do not entail the consequence that highly excited $N$ or $\Delta$ resonances
are insensitive to chiral symmetry breaking. Instead, the mechanism of mass
generation in excited states is suggested to be the same as for the baryon
ground states: the mass is assigned to fluctuating gluon fields and their
strong attraction. In excited baryons, the field energy has to be integrated
over a larger volume, and the total mass increases. Thus, also the additional
mass of resonances, the excitation energy, is generated by spontaneous breaking
of chiral symmetry.

Blatter [Phys. Rev. A 82, 012316 (2010)] to higher counting bases. The
algorithm makes use of qubits, qutrits, and qudits to count numbers in a base
2, base 3, or base d representation. In operating the algorithm, the number n <
N = d^K is read into a K-qudit register through its interaction with a stream
of n particles passing in a nearby wire; this step corresponds to a quantum
Fourier transformation from the Hilbert space of particles to the Hilbert space
of qudit states. An inverse quantum Fourier transformation provides the number
n in the base d representation; the inverse transformation is fully quantum at
the level of individual qudits, while a simpler semi-classical version can be
used on the level of qudit registers. Combining registers of qubits, qutrits,
and qudits, where d is a prime number, with a simpler single-shot measurement
allows to find the powers of 2, 3, and other primes d in the number n. We show,
that the counting task naturally leads to the shift operation and an algorithm
based on the quantum Fourier transformation. We discuss possible
implementations of the algorithm using quantum spin-d systems, d-well systems,
and their emulation with spin-1/2 or double-well systems. We establish the
analogy between our counting algorithm and the phase estimation algorithm and
make use of the latter's performance analysis in stabilizing our scheme.
Applications embrace a quantum metrological scheme to measure a voltage (analog
to digital converter) and a simple procedure to entangle multi-particle states.

dependence in the electric-magnetic asymmetry in the dimension 2 condensate.
This asymmetry measures the difference between the spatial and the temporal
components of the <A^2> condensate. Lattice computations have shown very
interesting phenomena. The asymmetry shows a jump at the deconfinement phase
transition, beyond which it approaches its perturbative value. At temperatures
lower than the critical temperature, it shows an exponential behavior with in
the exponent a mass smaller than the lowest glueball mass. In this talk we
present research done on this asymmetry, using a generalization of analytical
methods developed to study <A^2>. The purpose is to shed more insight on the

toward supernova remnant (SNR) IC443. CO molecular shell is well coincident
with the partial shell of the SNR detected in radio continuum observations. The
broad emission lines and three 1720-MHz OH masers were detected in CO molecular
shell. The present observations have provided further evidence in support of
the interaction between the SNR and the adjoining molecular clouds (MCs). The
total mass of the MCs is 9.26*10^{3} sun masses. The integrated CO line
intensity ratio I(CO(3-2))/I(CO(2-1)) for the whole molecular cloud is between
0.79 and 3.40. The average value is 1.58, which is much higher than previous
measurements of individual Galactic MCs. Higher line ratios imply that shocks
have driven into the MCs. We conclude that high I(CO(3-2))/I(CO(2-1)) is
identified as one good signature of SNR-MCs interacting system. Based on $IRAS$
Point Source Catalog and 2MASS near-infrared database, 12 protostellar objects
and 1666 young stellar objects (YSOs) candidates (including 154 CTTSs and 419
HAeBe stars) are selected. In the interacting regions, the significant
enhancement of the number of protostellar objects and YSOs indicates the
presence of some recently formed stars. After comparing the characteristic
timescales of star formation with the age of IC443, we conclude that the
protostellar objects and YSOs candidates are not triggered by IC443. For the
age of stellar winds shell, we have performed calculation on the basis of
stellar winds shell expansion model. The results and analysis suggest that the
formation of these stars may be triggered by the stellar winds of IC443

equilibria that are more or less favorable to the members of certain
populations. In particular, it is possible that the members of one or several
populations do not contribute anything, a behavior called defecting, while the
others still contribute enough to reach the threshold. Which of these
equilibria then is attained is decided by the dynamics at the population level
that in turn depends on the strategic options the players possess. We find that
defecting occurs when more than 3 populations participate in the game, even
when the strategy scheme employed is very simple, if certain conditions for the
system parameters are satisfied. The results are obtained through systematic
simulations.

symmetry content. This occurs in particular for diffeomorphism symmetry in

actions, which attempts to restore gauge symmetries by mirroring exactly
continuum physics on a lattice via a coarse graining process. Analytical
results can only be obtained via a perturbative approach, for which we consider
the first steps, namely the coarse graining of the linearized theory. The
linearized gauge symmetries are exact also in the discretized theory, hence we
develop a formalism to deal with gauge systems. Finally we provide a
discretization of linearized gravity as well as a coarse graining map and show
that with this choice the 3D linearized gravity action is invariant under
coarse graining.

  Deep Inference","26 pages: Final technical report associated to the TLCA2011 paper
  ""Linear lambda calculus and deep inference""",,,,"cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  SBV is a deep inference system that extends the set of logical operators of
multiplicative linear logic with the non commutative operator Seq. We introduce
the logical system SBVr which extends SBV by adding a self-dual atom-renaming
operator to it. We prove that the cut elimination holds on SBVr. SBVr and its
cut free subsystem BVr are complete and sound with respect to linear lambda
calculus with explicit substitutions. Under any strategy, a sequence of
evaluation steps of any linear lambda-term M becomes a process of proof-search
in SBVr (BVr) once M is mapped into a formula of SBVr. Completeness and
soundness follow from simulating linear beta-reduction with explicit
substitutions as processes. The role of the new renaming operator of SBVr is to
rename channel-names on-demand. This simulates the substitution that occurs in
a beta-reduction. Despite SBVr is a minimal extension of SBV its proof-search
can compute all boolean functions, as linear lambda-calculus with explicit
substitutions can compute all boolean functions as well. So, proof search of
SBVr and BVr is at least ptime-complete.

found to affect the time evolution of the two-mode squeezing and intensity of
the cavity radiation significantly. The intensity and degree of the two-mode
squeezing increase at early stages of the process with time, but this trend
changes rapidly afterwards. It is also shown that they increase with phase
fluctuation and dephasing in the strong driving limit, however the situation
appears to be opposite in the weak driving limit. This essentially suggests
that the phase fluctuation and dephasing weaken the coherence induced by a
strong driving mechanism so that the spontaneous emission gets a chance. The
other important aspect of the phase fluctuation, in this regard, is the
relaxation of the time at which the maximum squeezing is manifested as well as
the time in which the radiation remains in a squeezed state.

We can then break the symmetry in the game and give the members of the two
populations access to different strategy spaces. Typically, simpler strategy
types have an advantage because they tend to go more quickly towards a
favorable equilibrium which, once reached, the other population is forced to
accept. Also, populations with bolder individuals that may not fare so well at
the level of individual performance may obtain an advantage towards ones with
more timid players. By checking the effects of parameters such as the
generation length or the mutation rate, we are able to compare the relative
contributions of individual learning and evolutionary adaptations.

based on molecular dynamics simulations, that a nanoscale water droplet at the
outer surface of a graphene cone always spontaneously moves toward the larger
end of the cone, and at the inner surface toward the smaller end. The analysis
on the van der Waals interaction potential between a single water molecule and
a curved graphene surface reveals that the curvature with its gradient does
generate the driving force resulting in the above directional motion.
Furthermore, we found that the direction of the above movement is independent
of the wettability, namely is regardless of either hydrophobic or hydrophilic
of the surface. However, the latter surface is in general leading to higher
motion speed than the former. The above results provide a basis for a better
understanding of many reported observations, and helping design of curved

quantum mechanics with a one-dimensional deformed Heisenberg algebra of the

minimal observable length $\sqrt\beta$. For a generic pairwise interaction
potential, analytical formulas are obtained that allow to estimate the
ground-state energy of the $N$-body system by finding the ground-state energy
of a corresponding two-body problem. It is first shown that, in the harmonic
oscillator case, the $\beta$-dependent term grows faster with $N$ than the
$\beta$-independent one. Then, it is argued that such a behavior should be
observed also with generic potentials and for $D$-dimensional systems. In
consequence, quantum $N$-body bound states might be interesting places to look
at nontrivial manifestations of a minimal length since, the more particles are
present, the more the system deviates from standard quantum mechanical

associated particle spectrum shows that the spectrum is soft at the onset of
the particle event. A flat spectrum is observed at the peak of the particle
event and the spectrum becomes steeper as the CME moves farther out into the
inner heliosphere. However, the magnitude of change in spectral slopes differs
from one CME to the other, suggesting the difference in energy available within
the CME to drive the shock. The spectral index evolution as a function of
initial speed of the CME at different parts of the particle profile has also
been compared. The result shows that the change in particle flux with time is
rather quick for the high-energy portion of the spectrum than that of the
low-energy part, which makes the steepening of the energy spectrum with
time/distance from the Sun. It indicates that the acceleration of particles by
a CME-driven shock may be efficient at low energies ($\leq$30 MeV) and the
efficiency of the shock decreases gradually towards the high-energy side of the

The perturbative expansion expressed in terms of the pole mass exhibits no sign
of convergence whereas reorganizing this very expansion in terms of the MS-bar
mass yields a rather clear hierarchy of the perturbative contributions.
Accordingly, the decay constants extracted from the pole-mass correlator turn
out to be considerably smaller than those extracted from its MS-bar-mass
counterpart. Then, making use of the OPE in terms of the MS-bar mass we derive
the decay constants of heavy mesons with emphasis on acquiring control over the
uncertainties in the decay constants, related both to the input QCD parameters

has become possible due to the application of our novel procedure for
extracting hadron observables based on dual thresholds which depend on the

Differential rotation and helical Rossby waves combine to contribute to the

differential rotation plays an important role in the dynamo because of
different patterns of Rossby waves in prograde and retrograde flows. At a rapid
global rotation rate, stronger flow supercriticality (namely the difference
between the differential rotation rate of the flow and its critical value for
the onset of nonaxisymmetric instability) facilitates the onset of dynamo

emission markets, for example, the EU ETS. The proposed structural model is
positioned between existing complex full equilibrium models and pure reduced
form models. Using an exogenously specified demand for a polluting good it
gives a causal explanation for the accumulation of CO2 emissions and takes into
account the feedback effect from the cost of carbon to the rate at which the
market emits CO2. We derive a forward-backward stochastic differential equation
for the price process of the allowance certificate and solve the associated
semilinear partial differential equation numerically. We also show that
derivatives written on the allowance certificate satisfy a linear partial
differential equation. The model is extended to emission markets with multiple
compliance periods and we analyse the impact different intertemporal connecting
mechanisms, such as borrowing, banking and withdrawal, have on the allowance
price.

superfluidity to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in a two-dimensional Fermi
gas at T=0 using the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo method. We calculate the
equation of state and the gap parameter as a function of the interaction
strength, observing large deviations compared to mean-field predictions. In the
BEC regime our results show the important role of dimer-dimer and atom-dimer
interaction effects that are completely neglected in the mean-field picture.
Results on Tan's contact parameter associated with short-range physics are also
reported along the BCS-BEC crossover.

  effect of magnetic field","16 pages, 27 figures",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Studies have shown that emission of gravitational wave drives an instability
in the $r$-modes of young rapidly rotating neutron stars carrying away most of
the angular momentum through gravitational wave emission in the first year or
so after their formation. Magnetic field plays a crucial role in the evolution
of these $r$-modes and hence the evolution of the neutron star itself. An
attempt is made here to investigate the role of magnetic field in the evolution
of $r$-mode instability and detectibility of gravitational waves emitted by a
newly born, hot and rapidly and differentially rotating neutron star. It is
found that magnetic field tend to suppress the $r$-mode amplitude. The {\it
signal-to-noise ratio} analysis shows that gravitational waves emitted from the
$r$-mode instability from neutron stars with magnetic fields upto the order of
$10^{14}$ gauss may be detectable by the Advanced LIGO at 20 Mpc.

At first glance this sounds crazy. However, very
feeble gravitational and electroweak effects allow for this exotic possibility.
Unfortunately, with present and near future technologies the opportunity to
observe light shining through walls via these effects is completely out of
question. Nevertheless there are quite a number of experimental collaborations
around the globe involved in this quest. Why are they doing it? Are there
additional ways of sending photons through opaque matter? Indeed, various
extensions of the standard model of particle physics predict the existence of
new particles called WISPs - extremely weakly interacting slim particles.
Photons can convert into these hypothetical particles, which have no problems
to penetrate very dense materials, and these can reconvert into photons after
their passage - as if light was effectively traversing walls. We review this
exciting field of research, describing the most important WISPs, the present
and future experiments, the indirect hints from astrophysics and cosmology
pointing to the existence of WISPs, and finally outlining the consequences that
the discovery of WISPs would have.
