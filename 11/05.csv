Poynting-flux-dominated outflow. We propose a model of gamma-ray burst (GRB)
prompt emission in the Poynting-flux-dominated regime, namely, the
Internal-Collision-induced MAgnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model.
It is envisaged that the GRB central engine launches an intermittent,
magnetically-dominated wind, and that in the GRB emission region, the ejecta is
still moderately magnetized. Similar to the internal shock (IS) model, the
mini-shells interact internally at the traditional internal shock radius. Most
of these early collision have little energy dissipation, but serve to distort
the ordered magnetic field lines. At a certain point, the distortion of
magnetic field configuration reaches the critical condition to allow fast
reconnection seeds to occur, which induce relativistic MHD turbulence in the
interaction regions. The turbulence further distorts field lines easing
additional magnetic reconnections, resulting in a runway release of the stored
magnetic field energy (an ICMART event). Particles accelerated in the ICMART
region radiate synchrotron photons that power the observed gamma-rays. Each
ICMART event corresponds to a broad pulse in the GRB lightcurve, and a GRB is
composed of multiple ICMART events. This model retains the merits of the IS and
other models, but may overcome several difficulties/issues faced by the IS
model (e.g. low efficiency, fast cooling, electron number excess,
Amati/Yonetoku relation inconsistency, and missing bright photosphere). It
predicts two-component variability time scales, and a decreasing Ep and
polarization degree during each ICMART event. The model may be applied to most
Fermi LAT GRBs that have time-resolved, featureless Band-function spectra
(abridged).

inter-galactic-medium (IGM) is provided by the diffuse Mpc--scale synchrotron
emissions observed from galaxy clusters. It has been proposed that MHD
turbulence, generated during cluster-cluster mergers, may be a source of
particle reacceleration in the IGM. Calculations of turbulent acceleration must
account self-consistently for the complex non--linear coupling between
turbulent waves and particles. This has been calculated in some detail under
the assumption that turbulence interacts in a collisionless way with the IGM.
In this paper we explore a different picture of acceleration by compressible
turbulence in galaxy clusters, where the interaction between turbulence and the
IGM is mediated by plasma instabilities and maintained collisional at scales
much smaller than the Coulomb mean free path. In this regime most of the energy
of fast modes is channeled into the reacceleration of relativistic particles
and the acceleration process approaches a universal behaviour being
self-regulated by the back-reaction of the accelerated particles on turbulence
itself. Assuming that relativistic protons contribute to several percent (or
less) of the cluster energy, consistent with the FERMI observations of nearby
clusters, we find that compressible turbulence at the level of a few percent of
the thermal energy can reaccelerate relativistic electrons at GeV energies,
that are necessary to explain the observed diffuse radio emission in the form
of giant radio halos.

synthesis is done by a light-directed chemical process. The objective is to
minimize unintended illumination that may contaminate the quality of
experiments. Unintended illumination is measured by a notion called border
length and the problem is called Border Minimization Problem (BMP). The
objective of the BMP is to place a set of probe sequences in the array and find
an embedding (deposition of nucleotides/residues to the array cells) such that
the sum of border length is minimized. A variant of the problem, called P-BMP,
is that the placement is given and the concern is simply to find the embedding.
Approximation algorithms have been previously proposed for the problem but it
is unknown whether the problem is NP-hard or not. In this paper, we give a
thorough study of different variations of BMP by giving NP-hardness proofs and
improved approximation algorithms. We show that P-BMP, 1D-BMP, and BMP are all
NP-hard. Contrast with the previous result that 1D-P-BMP is polynomial time
solvable, the interesting implications include (i) the array dimension (1D or
2D) differentiates the complexity of P-BMP; (ii) for 1D array, whether
placement is given differentiates the complexity of BMP; (iii) BMP is NP-hard
regardless of the dimension of the array. Another contribution of the paper is
improving the approximation for BMP from $O(n^{1/2} \log^2 n)$ to $O(n^{1/4}

Swift/UVOT, photo-zs are derived for five GRBs for which spectroscopic
redshifts are not available. We use UV/optical/NIR data and synthetic
photometry based on afterglow observations and theory to derive the photometric
redshifts of GRBs and their accuracy. Taking into account the afterglow
synchrotron emission properties, we investigate the application of photometry
to derive redshifts in a theoretical range between z~1 and z~12. The
measurement of photo-zs for GRB afterglows provides a quick, robust and
reliable determination of the distance scale to the burst, particularly in
those cases where spectroscopic observations in the optical/NIR range cannot be
obtained. Given a sufficiently bright and mildly reddened afterglow, the
relative photo-z accuracy is better than 10% between z=1.5 and z~7 and better
than 5% between z=2 and z=6. We detail the approach on 5 sources without
spectroscopic redshifts observed with UVOT on-board Swift and/or GROND. The
distance scale to those same afterglows is measured to be
$z=4.31^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$ for GRB 080825B, $z=2.13^{+0.14}_{-0.20}$ for GRB

from UVOT with ground-based observatories and in particular GROND operating in
the optical/NIR wavelength regime, reliable photo-zs can be obtained from z ~
1.0 out to z ~ 10, and possibly even at higher redshifts in some favorable
cases, provided that these GRBs exist, are localized quickly, have sufficiently
bright afterglows and are not heavily obscured.

Phys. Fluids 14, 170 (2002)] by combining the long-wave approximation with a
weighted residuals technique. The model includes (second-order) viscous
dispersion effects which originate from the streamwise momentum equation and
tangential stress balance. These effects play a dispersive role that primarily
influences the shape of the capillary ripples in front of the solitary pulses.
We show that different physical parameters, such as surface tension and
viscosity, play a crucial role in the interaction between solitary pulses
giving rise eventually to the formation of bound states consisting of two or
more pulses separated by well-defined distances and travelling at the same
velocity. By developing a rigorous coherent-structure theory, we are able to
theoretically predict the pulse-separation distances for which bound states are
formed. Viscous dispersion affects the distances at which bound states are
observed. We show that the theory is in very good agreement with computations
of the second-order model. We also demonstrate that the presence of bound
states allows the film free surface to reach a self-organized state that can be
statistically described in terms of a gas of solitary waves separated by a
typical mean distance and characterized by a typical density.

Model and in indirect searches for new physics. While the precision of
experimental results has improved over the last years this has still to be
matched by equally precise theoretical predictions. The calculation of
heavy-light form factors is currently carried out in lattice QCD. Due to its
small Compton wavelength we discretize the heavy quark in an effective
non-relativistic theory. By formulating the theory in a moving frame of
reference discretization errors in the final state are reduced at large recoil.
Over the last years the formalism has been improved and tested extensively.
Systematic uncertainties are reduced by renormalizing the m(oving)NRQCD action
and heavy-light decay operators. The theory differs from QCD only for large
loop momenta at the order of the lattice cutoff and the calculation can be
carried out in perturbation theory as an expansion in the strong coupling
constant. In this paper we calculate the one loop corrections to the
heavy-light vector and tensor operator. Due to the complexity of the action the
generation of lattice Feynman rules is automated and loop integrals are solved
by the adaptive Monte Carlo integrator VEGAS. We discuss the infrared and
ultraviolet divergences in the loop integrals both in the continuum and on the
lattice. The light quarks are discretized in the ASQTad and highly improved
staggered quark (HISQ) action; the formalism is easily extended to other quark

coefficients of the inhomogeneous turbulence produced by the layer. We show
that the growth rate of the instability and the twist of the magnetic field
vary monotonically with the ratio of thermal conductivity to magnetic
diffusivity. The resulting alpha effect is inhomogeneous and increases with the
strength of the initial magnetic field. It is thus an example of an
""anti-quenched"" alpha effect. The alpha effect is nonlocal, requiring around
8--16 Fourier modes to reconstruct the actual EMF based on the actual mean

the Energy-Time Diagram (ETD) where we plot the total energy of the eruption
against its eruption timescale. ILOTs and major LBV eruptions occupy the
Optical Transient Stripe (OTS) in the ETD. The upper boundary of the stripe is
explained by our proposed model where a main sequence (or a slightly off-main

that it cannot be a nova, even not an extreme one. We build a model where ILOTs
can become optically thin in a timescale of few years and the inflated envelope
collapses into an accretion disk around the star. Such an ILOT will evolve

the internal polarity inversion line, the formation of a soft X-ray sigmoid
along the inversion line and a coronal mass ejection. The evolution of the
photospheric magnetic field is described and used to estimate how much flux is
reconnected into the flux rope. About one third of the active region flux
cancels at the internal polarity inversion line in the 2.5~days leading up to
the eruption. In this period, the coronal structure evolves from a weakly to a
highly sheared arcade and then to a sigmoid that crosses the inversion line in
the inverse direction. These properties suggest that a flux rope has formed
prior to the eruption. The amount of cancellation implies that up to 60% of the
active region flux could be in the body of the flux rope. We point out that
only part of the cancellation contributes to the flux in the rope if the arcade
is only weakly sheared, as in the first part of the evolution. This reduces the
estimated flux in the rope to $\sim\!30%$ or less of the active region flux. We
suggest that the remaining discrepancy between our estimate and the limiting
value of $\sim\!10%$ of the active region flux, obtained previously by the flux
rope insertion method, results from the incomplete coherence of the flux rope,
due to nonuniform cancellation along the polarity inversion line. A hot linear
feature is observed in the active region which rises as part of the eruption
and then likely traces out field lines close to the axis of the flux rope. The
flux cancellation and changing magnetic connections at one end of this feature
suggest that the flux rope reaches coherence by reconnection shortly before and
early in the impulsive phase of the associated flare. The sigmoid is destroyed
in the eruption but reforms within a few hours after a moderate amount of
further cancellation has occurred.

Much attention has been focused on using the distribution of collapsed objects
(i.e. dark matter halos and the galaxies and galaxy clusters that reside in
them) to probe primordial NG. An equally interesting and complementary probe
however is the abundance of extended underdense regions or voids in the LSS.
The calculation of the abundance of voids using the excursion set formalism in
the presence of primordial NG is subject to the same technical issues as the
one for halos, which were discussed e.g. in arXiv:1005.1203. However, unlike
the excursion set problem for halos which involved random walks in the presence
of one barrier $\delta_c$, the void excursion set problem involves two barriers
$\delta_v$ and $\delta_c$. This leads to a new complication introduced by what
is called the ""void-in-cloud"" effect discussed in the literature, which is
unique to the case of voids. We explore a path integral approach which allows
us to carefully account for all these issues, leading to a rigorous derivation
of the effects of primordial NG on void abundances. The void-in-cloud issue in
particular makes the calculation conceptually rather different from the one for
halos. However, we show that its final effect can be described by a simple yet
accurate approximation. Our final void abundance function is valid on larger
scales than the expressions of other authors, while being broadly in agreement
with those expressions on smaller scales.

Synthetic profiles are calculated from numerical simulations of outflow
launching by star-disc interaction. Profiles are calculated for several
possible configurations of the stellar field: dipolar (with surface strengths,
B of 1, 2 and 5 kG) or dynamo fed. Also two types of discs, passive or
subjected to an alpha/Omega-dynamo, are considered. These profiles have been
used to define the locus of the various models in the observational diagram:
dispersion versus centroid, for the profiles of the SiIII] line. Bulk motions
produce an increasing broadening of the profile as the lever arm launching the
jet becomes more efficient; predicted profiles are however, sensitive to the
disc inclination. Models are compared with observations of the SiIII] lines

produce a flickering of the profile during quiescence with variations in the
line flux of about 10%. At outburst, accretion signatures appear in the
profiles together with an enhancement of the wind, producing the correlation
between accretion and outflow as reported from RU Lup, AA Tau and RW Aur

relaxed, and the minimality of the solution of the QVE is expressed in terms of
properties of the Jacobian of a suitable function. From the computational point
of view, we elaborate on the Perron vector-based iteration proposed in
[http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0577]. In particular we provide a condition which
ensures that the Perron iteration converges to the sought solution of the QVE.
Moreover we introduce a variant of the algorithm which consists in applying the
Newton method instead of a fixed-point iteration. This method has the same
convergence behaviour as the Perron iteration, since its convergence speed
increases for close-to-critical problems. Moreover, unlike the Perron
iteration, the method has a quadratic convergence. Finally, we show that it is
possible to alter the bilinear form defining the QVE in several ways without
changing the solution. This modification has an impact on convergence speed of
the algorithms.

polarization when the majority of neutron spins are oriented oppositely to the

gluons first decay to quark-antiquark pairs and then each pair loses energy as
propagating through the medium. We show that the estimates of the energy-loss

can therefore remove the tension between the low gas infall rates that are

fundamental interest in statistics. Existing methods such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov
and Cramer-von-Mises tests do not scale well as the dimensionality increases
and provides no easy way to characterize the difference should it exist. In
this work, we propose a theoretical framework for inference that addresses
these challenges in the form of a prior for Bayesian nonparametric analysis.
The new prior is constructed based on a random-partition-and-assignment
procedure similar to the one that defines the standard optional P\'olya tree
distribution, but has the ability to generate multiple random distributions
jointly. These random probability distributions are allowed to ""couple"", that
is to have the same conditional distribution, on subsets of the sample space.
We show that this ""coupling optional P\'olya tree"" prior provides a convenient
and effective way for both the testing of two sample difference and the
learning of the underlying structure of the difference. In addition, we discuss
some practical issues in the computational implementation of this prior and
provide several numerical examples to demonstrate its work.

gravitational wave (GW) detection by the fully operational network of
ground-based observatories. In anticipation of the first detections, the
expected distribution of GW sources in the local universe is of considerable
interest. Here we investigate the full phase space distribution of coalescing
compact binaries at $z = 0$ using dark matter simulations of structure
formation. The fact that these binary systems acquire large barycentric
velocities at birth (""kicks"") results in merger site distributions that are
more diffusely distributed with respect to their putative hosts, with mergers
occurring out to distances of a few Mpc from the host halo. Redshift estimates
based solely on the nearest galaxy in projection can, as a result, be
inaccurate. On the other hand, large offsets from the host galaxy could aid the
detection of faint optical counterparts and should be considered when designing
strategies for follow-up observations. The degree of isotropy in the projected
sky distributions of GW sources is found to be augmented with increasing kick
velocity and to be severely enhanced if progenitor systems possess large kicks
as inferred from the known population of pulsars and double compact binaries.
Even in the absence of observed electromagnetic counterparts, the differences
in sky distributions of binaries produced by disparate kick-velocity models
could be discerned by GW observatories, within the expected accuracies and
detection rates of advanced LIGO--in particular with the addition of more
interferometers.

to understand the decay of BPS bound states across walls of marginal stability
in the space of parameters or vacua. By representing the potentially unstable
bound states as multi-centered black hole solutions in N=2 supergravity, we
provide two fully general and explicit formulae for the change in the (refined)
index across the wall. The first, ""Higgs branch"" formula relies on Reineke's
results for invariants of quivers without oriented loops, specialized to the
Abelian case. The second, ""Coulomb branch"" formula results from evaluating the
symplectic volume of the classical phase space of multi-centered solutions by
localization. We provide extensive evidence that these new formulae agree with
each other and with the mathematical results of Kontsevich and Soibelman (KS)
and Joyce and Song (JS). The main physical insight behind our results is that
the Bose-Fermi statistics of individual black holes participating in the bound
state can be traded for Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, provided the (integer)
index \Omega(\gamma) of the internal degrees of freedom carried by each black
hole is replaced by an effective (rational) index \bar\Omega(\gamma)=
\sum_{m|\gamma} \Omega(\gamma/m)/m^2. A similar map also exists for the refined
index. This observation provides a physical rationale for the appearance of the
rational Donaldson-Thomas invariant \bar\Omega(\gamma) in the works of KS and
JS. The simplicity of the wall crossing formula for rational invariants allows
us to generalize the ""semi-primitive wall-crossing formula"" to arbitrary decays

indicative of mass outflow, in six luminous red giant stars of the stellar
cluster {\omega} Cen. Methods. We compare synthetic line profiles computed
using relevant model chromospheres to observed profiles of the H{\alpha} and Ca
II K lines. The spectra were taken with UVES (R=45,000) and the stars were
selected so that three of them belong to the metal-rich population and three to
the metal-poor population, and sample as far down as 1 to 2.5 magnitudes
fainter than the respective RGB tips. Results. We do indeed reveal the presence
of low-velocity outward motions in four of our six targets, without any
apparent correlation with astrophysical parameters. Conclusions. This provides
direct evidence that outward velocity fields and mass motions exist in RGB
stars as much as 2.5 mag fainter than the tip. On the assumption that the mass
outflow may eventually lead to mass loss from the star, we estimate mass-loss
rates of some 10^{-9}-10^{-10} M$_{\odot}$ yr^{-1} that are compatible with the

we show that capacity decays quadratically with k. Furthermore, we prove
rigorously that the asymptotic capacity is 1/(k^2 2ln2) and we confirm our
earlier conjecture that Tardos' choice of the arcsine distribution
asymptotically maximizes the mutual information payoff function while the
interleaving attack minimizes it. Along with the asymptotic behavior, numerical
solutions to the game for small k are also presented.

recent advances in data-stream algorithms. We show that a number of these
results follow easily from the application of a single probabilistic method
called Precision Sampling. Using this method, we obtain simple data-stream
algorithms that maintain a randomized sketch of an input vector
$x=(x_1,...x_n)$, which is useful for the following applications. 1) Estimating
the $F_k$-moment of $x$, for $k>2$. 2) Estimating the $\ell_p$-norm of $x$, for
$p\in[1,2]$, with small update time. 3) Estimating cascaded norms
$\ell_p(\ell_q)$ for all $p,q>0$. 4) $\ell_1$ sampling, where the goal is to
produce an element $i$ with probability (approximately) $|x_i|/\|x\|_1$. It
extends to similarly defined $\ell_p$-sampling, for $p\in [1,2]$.
  For all these applications the algorithm is essentially the same: scale the
vector x entry-wise by a well-chosen random vector, and run a heavy-hitter
estimation algorithm on the resulting vector. Our sketch is a linear function
of x, thereby allowing general updates to the vector x.
  Precision Sampling itself addresses the problem of estimating a sum
$\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$ from weak estimates of each real $a_i\in[0,1]$. More
precisely, the estimator first chooses a desired precision $u_i\in(0,1]$ for
each $i\in[n]$, and then it receives an estimate of every $a_i$ within additive
$u_i$. Its goal is to provide a good approximation to $\sum a_i$ while keeping
a tab on the ""approximation cost"" $\sum_i (1/u_i)$. Here we refine previous
work [Andoni, Krauthgamer, and Onak, FOCS 2010] which shows that as long as
$\sum a_i=\Omega(1)$, a good multiplicative approximation can be achieved using
total precision of only $O(n\log n)$.

permutation from a public random function (i.e., which can be accessed by the
adversary). This goal is formalized by the notion of indifferentiability of
Maurer et al. (TCC 2004). This is the natural extension to the public setting
of the well-studied problem of building random permutations from random
functions, which was first solved by Luby and Rackoff (Siam J. Comput., '88)
using the so-called Feistel construction.
  The most important implication of such a construction is the equivalence of
the random oracle model (Bellare and Rogaway, CCS '93) and the ideal cipher
model, which is typically used in the analysis of several constructions in
symmetric cryptography.
  Coron et al. (CRYPTO 2008) gave a rather involved proof that the six-round
Feistel construction with independent random round functions is
indifferentiable from an invertible random permutation. Also, it is known that
fewer than six rounds do not suffice for indifferentiability. The first
contribution (and starting point) of our paper is a concrete distinguishing
attack which shows that the indifferentiability proof of Coron et al. is not
correct. In addition, we provide supporting evidence that an
indifferentiability proof for the six-round Feistel construction may be very
hard to find.
  To overcome this gap, our main contribution is a proof that the Feistel
construction with eigthteen rounds is indifferentiable from an invertible
random permutation. The approach of our proof relies on assigning to each of
the rounds in the construction a unique and specific role needed in the proof.
This avoids many of the problems that appear in the six-round case.

localized modes in a symmetric linearly coupled system of two such equations,
focusing on asymmetric states. The model may describe ""optical bullets"" in
dual-core nonlinear optical waveguides (including spatiotemporal vortices that
were not discussed before), or a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) loaded into a
""dual-pancake"" trap. Each family of solutions in the single-component model has
two different counterparts in the coupled system, one symmetric and one
asymmetric. Similarly to the earlier studied coupled 1D system with the CQ
nonlinearity, the present model features bifurcation loops, for fundamental and
vortex solitons alike: with the increase of the total energy (norm), the
symmetric solitons become unstable at a point of the direct bifurcation, which
is followed, at larger values of the energy, by the reverse bifurcation
restabilizing the symmetric solitons. However, on the contrary to the 1D
system, the system may demonstrate a double bistability for the fundamental
solitons. The stability of the solitons is investigated via the computation of
instability growth rates for small perturbations. Vortex rings, which we study
for two values of the ""spin"", s = 1 and 2, may be subject to the azimuthal
instability, like in the single-component model. We also develop a
quasi-analytical approach to the description of the bifurcations diagrams,
based on the variational approximation. Splitting of asymmetric vortices,
induced by the azimuthal instability, is studied by means of direct

limit for the highest quasar black hole masses at a given redshift is an
artifact due to biases in black hole mass measurements. This sub-Eddington
boundary (with non-unity slope) in the quasar mass-luminosity plane was
initially reported by Steinhardt & Elvis (2010a) using the FWHM-based black
hole mass catalogue of Shen et al. (2008). However, the significance of the
boundary is reduced when the FWHM-based mass-scaling relationship is
recalibrated following Wang et al. (2009) and using the most updated
reverberation mapping estimates of black hole masses. Furthermore, this
boundary is not seen using mass estimates based on the line dispersion of the
same quasars' MgII emission lines. Thus, the initial report of a sub-Eddington
boundary with non-unity slope was due to biases in estimating masses using the
FWHM of a fit of one or two Gaussians to quasar MgII emission lines. We provide
evidence that using the line dispersion of the MgII line produces less biased
black hole mass estimates.

existence of sub-optimal maxima. Within a unified framework under specified

offset from the galaxies' systemic redshifts, probably because of large-scale
outflows. We calibrate galaxy redshifts measured from rest-frame UV lines by
utilizing the fact that the mean HI Ly-alpha absorption profiles around the
galaxies, as seen in spectra of background objects, must be symmetric with
respect to the true galaxy redshifts if the galaxies are oriented randomly with
respect to the lines of sight to the background objects. We use 15 QSOs at
z~2.5-3 and more than 600 foreground galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts at
z~1.9-2.5. All galaxies are within 2 Mpc proper from the lines of sight to the
background QSOs. We find that LyA emission and ISM absorption redshifts require
systematic shifts of v_LyA=-295(+35)(-35) km/s and v_ISM=145(+70)(-35) km/s.
Assuming a Gaussian distribution, we put 1-sigma upper limits on possible
random redshift offsets of <220 km/s for LyA and <420 km/s for ISM redshifts.
For the small subset (<10%) of galaxies for which near-IR spectra have been
obtained, we can compare our results to direct measurements based on nebular
emission lines which we confirm to mark the systemic redshifts. While our v_ISM
agrees with the direct measurements, our v_LyA is significantly smaller.
However, when we apply our method to the near-IR subsample which is
characterized by slightly different selection effects, the best-fit velocity
offset comes into agreement with the direct measurement. This confirms the
validity of our approach, and implies that no single number appropriately
describes the whole population of galaxies, in line with the observation that
the line offset depends on galaxy spectral morphology. This method provides
accurate redshift calibrations and will enable studies of circumgalactic matter
around galaxies for which rest-frame optical observations are not available.

this task is---up to polynomial factors---equal to the agnostic learning
complexity of C in Kearns' statistical query (SQ) model. This gives a complete
answer to the question when running time is not a concern.
  + We then show that the problem can be solved efficiently (allowing arbitrary

harmonic spectra. We concentrate on structures in atoms due to interference of
different angular momentum channels during recombination. We use the Cooper
minimum (CM) in argon at 47 eV as a marker in the harmonic spectrum. We measure
2d harmonic spectra in argon as a function of wavelength and angular
divergence. While we identify a clear CM in the spectrum when the target gas
jet is placed after the laser focus, we find that the appearance of the CM
varies with angular divergence and can even be completely washed out when the
gas jet is placed closer to the focus. We also show that the argon CM appears
at different wavelengths in harmonic and photo-absorption spectra measured
under conditions independent of any wavelength calibration. We model the
experiment with a simulation based on coupled solutions of the time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equation and the Maxwell wave equation, including both the single
atom response and macroscopic effects of propagation. The single atom
calculations confirm that the ground state of argon can be represented by its
field free $p$ symmetry, despite the strong laser field used in high harmonic
generation. Because of this, the CM structure in the harmonic spectrum can be
described as the interference of continuum $s$ and $d$ channels, whose relative
phase jumps by $\pi$ at the CM energy, resulting in a minimum shifted from the
photoionization result. We also show that the full calculations reproduce the
dependence of the CM on the macroscopic conditions. We calculate simple phase
matching factors as a function of harmonic order and explain our experimental
and theoretical observation in terms of the effect of phase matching on the
shape of the harmonic spectrum. Phase matching must be taken into account to
fully understand spectral features related to HHG spectroscopy.

one boundary. This contrasted with the situation for word hyperbolic groups,
where it was well-known that each such group admitted a unique boundary---in a
very stong sense. Prior to Croke and Kleiner's discovery, it had been observed
by Geoghegan and Bestvina that a weaker sort of uniquness does hold for
boundaries of torsion free CAT(0) groups; in particular, any two such
boundaries always have the same shape. Hence, the boundary really does carry
significant information about the group itself. In an attempt to strengthen the
correspondence between group and boundary, Bestvina asked whether boundaries of
CAT(0) groups are unique up to cell-like equivalence. For the types of space
that arise as boundaries of CAT(0) groups, this is a notion that is weaker than
topological equivalence and stronger than shape equivalence. In this paper we
explore the Bestvina Cell-like Equivalence Question. We describe a
straightforward strategy with the potential for providing a fully general
positive answer. We apply that strategy to a number of test cases and show that
it succeeds---often in unexpectedly interesting ways.

formulate two-flavor theories for the various hyperon multiplets, the nearness
of kaon thresholds can seriously undermine the effectiveness of such two-flavor
theories in practice. We investigate the importance of virtual kaon thresholds
on hyperon properties, specifically their isovector axial charges and
electromagnetic observables. In particular we uncover the underlying expansion
parameter governing the description of virtual kaon thresholds. For spin-half
hyperons, this expansion parameter is under theoretical control. As a result,
the virtual kaon contributions are well described in the two-flavor theory by
terms analytic in the pion mass-squared. For spin three-half hyperons, however,
one is closer to the kaon production threshold, and the expansion parameter is
not as small. Breakdown of $SU(2)$ chiral perturbation theory is shown to arise
from a pole in the expansion parameter associated with the kaon threshold. We
find that, despite the fact that higher-order corrections to the expansion
parameter is necessary to ascertain whether the two-flavor theory of spin
three-half hyperons remains perturbative, there is a useful perturbative
expansion for isovector axial charges and magnetic moments of both spin-half

The first assumes that this galaxy is much younger than the age of the universe
at that epoch so that only supernovae (SNe) could have produced this dust. The
second scenario assumes a significantly older galactic age, so that the dust
could have formed in lower-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Presenting
new integral solutions for the chemical evolution of metals and dust in
galaxies, we offer a critical evaluation of these two scenarios, and
observational consequences that can discriminate between the two. We show that
AGB stars can produce the inferred mass of dust in this object, however, the
final mass of surviving dust depends on the galaxy's star formation history
(SFH). In general supernovae cannot produce the observed amount of dust unless
the average SN event creates over ~ 1 M\odot of dust in its ejecta. However,
special SFHs can be constructed in which SNe can produce the inferred dust mass
with a reasonable average dust yield of ~ 0.15 M\odot. The two scenarios
propose different origins for the galaxy's spectral energy distribution,
different star formation efficiencies and stellar masses, and consequently
different comoving number densities of J1148+5251-type hyperluminous infrared

soliton arrays (SSAs) in the framework of the cubic-quintic (CQ) complex
Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) model. The first approach deals with a broad beam
launched into the dissipative nonlinear medium, which is equipped with an
imprinted grating of a sufficiently sharp form. The beam splits into a cluster
of jets, each subsequently self-trapping into a stable soliton, if the power is
sufficient for that. We consider two kinds of sharp gratings -- ""raised-cosine""
(RC) and Kronig-Penney (KP) lattices -- and two types of the input beams,
fundamental and vortical. By selecting appropriate parameters, this method
makes it possible to create various types of solitons arrays, such as solid,
annular (with single and double rings), and cross-shaped ones. The second
method uses a ""virtual lattice"", in the form of a periodic transverse phase
modulation imprinted into the broad beam, which is passed through an
appropriate phase mask and then shone into a uniform nonlinear medium. Two
different types of the masks are considered, in the form of a ""checkerboard"" or
""tilings"". In that case, broad fundamental and vortical beams may also evolve
into stable SSAs, if the beam's power and spacing of the virtual phase lattice

basis of arbitrary projective estimates, which does not need the knowledge of
the noise correlation function, is proposed. A non-asymptotic upper bound for
quadratic risk (oracle inequality) has been derived under mild conditions on
the noise. For the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise the risk upper bound is shown to be
uniform in the nuisance parameter. In the case of gaussian white noise the
constructed procedure has some advantages as compared with the procedure based
on the least squares estimates (LSE). The asymptotic minimaxity of the
estimates has been proved. The proposed model selection scheme is extended also

the basis of the idea of measurement-induced interference: even if the number
of each gas is individually fixed finite and the symmetry of the system is not
broken, an interference pattern is observed on each single snapshot. The key
role is played by the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect, which leads to an
oscillating pattern of the cloud of identical atoms. Then, how essential is the
Bose-Einstein condensation to the interference? We describe the ideal Bose
gases trapped respectively in two spatially separated 3D harmonic traps at a
finite temperature as canonical ensembles with fixed numbers of atoms, and
compute the full statistics of the snapshot profiles of the expanding and
overlapping gases released from the traps. We obtain a simple formula, which
shows that the average fringe spectrum (average fringe contrast) is given by
the purity of each gas. The purity is known to be a good measure of
condensation, and this result clarifies the relevance of the condensation to
the interference. The fluctuation of the interference spectrum is also studied,
and it is shown that the fluctuation is vanishingly small below the critical
temperature, while it is nonvanishing above. This implies that interference
pattern is certainly observed on every snapshot below the critical temperature.
The fact that the number of atoms is fixed in the canonical ensemble is crucial
to this vanishing fluctuation.

proposed a theory of non-equilibrium steady states in direct analogy with the
theory of equilibrium states : the principle is to maximize the Shannon entropy
associated to the probability distribution of dynamical trajectories in the
presence of constraints, including the macroscopic current of interest, via the
method of Lagrange multipliers. This maximization leads directly to generalized
Gibbs distribution for the probability distribution of dynamical trajectories,
and to some fluctuation relation of the integrated current. The simplest
stochastic dynamics where these ideas can be applied are discrete-time Markov
chains, defined by transition probabilities $W_{i \to j}$ between
configurations $i$ and $j$ : instead of choosing the dynamical rules $W_{i \to
j} $ a priori, one determines the transition probabilities and the associate
stationary state that maximize the entropy of dynamical trajectories with the
other physical constraints that one wishes to impose. We give a self-contained
and unified presentation of this type of approach, both for discrete-time
Markov Chains and for continuous-time Master Equations. The obtained results
are in full agreement with the Bayesian approach introduced by Evans [Phys.

detailed balance', and with the 'invariant quantities' derived by Baule and

border rank of specific tensors, in particular for matrix multiplication. We
thus study specific orbit closure problems for the group $G = GL(W_1)\times
GL(W_2)\times GL(W_3)$ acting on the tensor product $W=W_1\otimes W_2\otimes
W_3$ of complex finite dimensional vector spaces. Let $G_s = SL(W_1)\times
SL(W_2)\times SL(W_3)$. A key idea from GCT2 is that the irreducible
$G_s$-representations occurring in the coordinate ring of the $G$-orbit closure
of a stable tensor $w\in W$ are exactly those having a nonzero invariant with
respect to the stabilizer group of $w$.
  However, we prove that by considering $G_s$-representations, as suggested in
GCT1-2, only trivial lower bounds on border rank can be shown. It is thus
necessary to study $G$-representations, which leads to geometric extension
problems that are beyond the scope of the subgroup restriction problems
emphasized in GCT1-2. We prove a very modest lower bound on the border rank of
matrix multiplication tensors using $G$-representations. This shows at least
that the barrier for $G_s$-representations can be overcome. To advance, we
suggest the coarser approach to replace the semigroup of representations of a
tensor by its moment polytope. We prove first results towards determining the

to improve Euclidean two-point functions in lattice QCD using the low-lying
eigenmodes of the Wilson-Dirac operator D. The contribution from the low modes
is averaged over all positions of the quark sources while the contribution from
high modes is calculated in the traditional way using one source point per
lattice. We apply this method to different baryon and meson two-point functions
and we compare the improvements using the eigenmodes of the non-hermitian
operator D and the eigenmodes of the hermitian operator Q=gamma5 D. The
convergence strongly depends on the parity of the states.

however, the current operator does not have overlap with any of the local

a first-hitting time is clearly of practical relevance, but does not seem to
have been studied so far. In neuroscience, many models for the membrane
potential evolution involve the presence of an upper threshold. Data are
modeled as discretely observed diffusions which are killed when the threshold
is reached. Statistical inference is often based on the misspecified likelihood
ignoring the presence of the threshold causing severe bias, e.g. the bias
incurred in the drift parameters of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for biological
relevant parameters can be up to 25-100%. We calculate or approximate the
likelihood function of the killed process. When estimating from a single
trajectory, considerable bias may still be present, and the distribution of the
estimates can be heavily skewed and with a huge variance. Parametric bootstrap
is effective in correcting the bias. Standard asymptotic results do not apply,
but consistency and asymptotic normality may be recovered when multiple
trajectories are observed, if the mean first-passage time through the threshold
is finite. Numerical examples illustrate the results and an experimental data
set of intracellular recordings of the membrane potential of a motoneuron is
analyzed.

the radio emission of PSR B0833-45, the Vela pulsar. At the time of the glitch,

Interferometer Gravitational-wave observatory (LIGO) were operational and
taking data as part of the fifth LIGO science run (S5). We present the first
direct search for the gravitational wave emission associated with oscillations
of the fundamental quadrupole mode excited by a pulsar timing glitch. No
gravitational wave detection candidate was found. We place Bayesian 90%
confidence upper limits of 6.3e-21 to 1.4e-20 on the peak intrinsic strain
amplitude of gravitational wave ring-down signals, depending on which spherical
harmonic mode is excited. The corresponding range of energy upper limits is

Rossby waves in the solar tachocline using the shallow water
magnetohydrodynamic approximation. Our analysis shows that the combination of
typical differential rotation and a toroidal magnetic field with a strength >
10^5 G triggers the instability of the m=1 magnetic Rossby wave harmonic with a
period of 2 years. This harmonic is antisymmetric with respect to the equator
and its period (and growth rate) depends on the differential rotation
parameters and the magnetic field strength. The oscillations may cause a
periodic magnetic flux emergence at the solar surface and consequently may lead
to the observed QBO in the solar activity features. The period of QBO may
change throughout the cycle, and from cycle to cycle, due to variations of the
mean magnetic field and differential rotation in the tachocline.

selection, subject to a proper choice of shrinkage parameter. Given a set of
potential subsets produced by a regularization algorithm, a consistent model
selection criterion is proposed to select the best one among this preselected
set. The approach leads to a fast and efficient procedure for variable

of the suggested criterion is proven when the number of covariates d is fixed.
Simulation studies suggest that the criterion still enjoys model selection
consistency when d is much larger than the sample size. The simulations also

differential privacy. Although the purchase and sale of private data has
already begun on a large scale, a theory of privacy as a commodity is missing.
In this paper, we propose to build such a theory. Specifically, we consider a
setting in which a data analyst wishes to buy information from a population
from which he can estimate some statistic. The analyst wishes to obtain an
accurate estimate cheaply. On the other hand, the owners of the private data
experience some cost for their loss of privacy, and must be compensated for
this loss. Agents are selfish, and wish to maximize their profit, so our goal
is to design truthful mechanisms. Our main result is that such auctions can
naturally be viewed and optimally solved as variants of multi-unit procurement
auctions. Based on this result, we derive auctions for two natural settings
which are optimal up to small constant factors:
  1. In the setting in which the data analyst has a fixed accuracy goal, we
show that an application of the classic Vickrey auction achieves the analyst's
accuracy goal while minimizing his total payment.
  2. In the setting in which the data analyst has a fixed budget, we give a
mechanism which maximizes the accuracy of the resulting estimate while
guaranteeing that the resulting sum payments do not exceed the analysts budget.
  In both cases, our comparison class is the set of envy-free mechanisms, which
correspond to the natural class of fixed-price mechanisms in our setting.
  In both of these results, we ignore the privacy cost due to possible
correlations between an individuals private data and his valuation for privacy
itself. We then show that generically, no individually rational mechanism can
compensate individuals for the privacy loss incurred due to their reported
valuations for privacy.

Several bounds in classical coding theory have been extended to network error
correction coding, especially the Singleton bound. In this paper, following the
research line using the extended global encoding kernels proposed in
\cite{zhang-correction}, the refined Singleton bound of NEC can be proved more
explicitly. Moreover, we give a constructive proof of the attainability of this
bound and indicate that the required field size for the existence of network
maximum distance separable (MDS) codes can become smaller further. By this
proof, an algorithm is proposed to construct general linear network error
correction codes including the linear network error correction MDS codes.
Finally, we study the error correction capability of random linear network
error correction coding. Motivated partly by the performance analysis of random
linear network coding \cite{Ho-etc-random}, we evaluate the different failure
probabilities defined in this paper in order to analyze the performance of
random linear network error correction coding. Several upper bounds on these
probabilities are obtained and they show that these probabilities will approach
to zero as the size of the base field goes to infinity. Using these upper
bounds, we slightly improve on the probability mass function of the minimum
distance of random linear network error correction codes in

the existence of linear network error correction codes with degradation at most

of 10 targets from observations over 18 months and a first version proper
motion catalog. The proper motions were obtained by combining PARSEC
observations astrometrically reduced with respect to the UCAC2 Catalog, and the
2MASS Catalog. The resulting median proper motion precision is 5mas/yr for
195,700 sources. The 140 0.3deg2 fields sample the southern hemisphere in an
unbiased fashion with the exception of the galactic plane due to the small
number of targets in that region. We present preliminary parallaxes with a 4.2
mas median precision for 10 brown dwarfs, 2 of which are within 10pc. These
increase by 20% the present number of L dwarfs with published parallaxes. Of
the 10 targets, 7 have been previously discussed in the literature: two were
thought to be binary but the PARSEC observations show them to be single, one
has been confirmed as a binary companion and another has been found to be part
of a binary system, both of which will make good benchmark systems.
Observations for the PARSEC program will end in early 2011 providing 3-4 years
of coverage for all targets. The main expected outputs are: more than a 100%
increase of the number of L dwarfs with parallaxes; to increment - in
conjuction with published results - to at least 10 the number of objects per
spectral subclass up to L9, and; to put sensible limits on the general binary
fraction of brown dwarfs. We aim to contribute significantly to the
understanding of the faint end of the H-R diagram and of the L/T transition

between the free string action and vacuum gauge fields and reveals the
important role of ultraviolet physics in understanding the lattice data at this

non-compact non-linear sigma models in the theory of disordered electron
systems: the hyperbolic Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation of
Pruisken-Schaefer type. Only recently the validity of such transformations was
proved in the case of U(p,q) (non-compact unitary) and O(p,q) (non-compact
orthogonal) symmetry. In this article we give a proof for general non-compact
symmetry groups. Moreover we show that the Pruisken-Schaefer type

deformation of the domain of integration. In particular we clarify the origin
of surprising sign factors which were recently discovered in the case of
orthogonal symmetry.

DFT-LDA-based transport simulation following the non-equilibrium Green's

is due to the mean-field description of electron correlation in the local

simulations which go beyond the mean-field level are required to accurately
describe current conduction through molecules. Finally, the results of the

100 pc. For our sample of nineteen A-type debris disk candidates chosen for
their IR excess, we have resolved, for the first time, five sources plus the
previously resolved disk around HD 141569. Two other sources in our sample have
been ruled out as debris disks since the time of sample selection. Three of the
six resolved sources have inferred radii of 1-4 AU (HD 38678, HD 71155, and HD
181869), and one source has an inferred radius ~10-30 AU (HD 141569). Among the
resolved sources with detections of excess IR emission, HD 71155 appears to be
comparable in size (r~2 AU) to the solar system's asteroid belt, thus joining
Zeta Lep (HD 38678, reported previously) to comprise the only two resolved
sources of that class. Two additional sources (HD 95418 and HD 139006) show
spatial extent that implies disk radii of ~1-3 AU, although the excess IR
fluxes are not formally detected with better than 2-sigma significance. For the
unresolved sources, the upper limits on the maximum radii of mid-IR disk
emission are in the range ~1-20 AU, four of which are comparable in radius to
the asteroid belt. We have compared the global color temperatures of the dust
to that expected for the dust in radiative equilibrium at the distances
corresponding to the observed sizes or limits on the sizes. In most cases, the
temperatures estimated via these two methods are comparable, and therefore, we
see a generally consistent picture of the inferred morphology and the global
mid-IR emission. Finally, while our sample size is not statistically
significant, we notice that the older sources (>200 Myr) host much warmer dust
(T > 400 K) than younger sources (in the 10s of Myr).

second Higgs doublet, is one of the simplest and most attractive scenarios that
can explain the dark matter. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of a
new viable region of the inert doublet model featuring dark matter masses
between Mw and about 160 GeV. Along this previously overlooked region of the
parameter space, the correct relic density is obtained thanks to cancellations
between different diagrams contributing to dark matter annihilation into gauge
bosons (W+W- and ZZ). First, we explain how these cancellations come about and
show several examples illustrating the effect of the parameters of the model on
the cancellations themselves and on the predicted relic density. Then, we
perform a full scan of the new viable region and analyze it in detail by
projecting it onto several two-dimensional planes. Finally, the prospects for
the direct and the indirect detection of inert Higgs dark matter within this
new viable region are studied. We find that present direct detection bounds
already rule out a fraction of the new parameter space and that future direct
detection experiments, such as Xenon100, will easily probe the remaining part
in its entirety.

deterministic, nonlinear dynamical system for evolving the statistical mean
state of a turbulent system. In this work SSST is applied to the problem of
understanding the formation of the roll/streak structures that arise from
free-stream turbulence (FST) and are associated with bypass transition in
boundary layers. Roll structures in the cross-stream/spanwise plane and
associated streamwise streaks are shown to arise as a linear instability of
interaction between the FST and the mean flow. In this interaction incoherent
Reynolds stresses arising from FST are organized by perturbation streamwise
streaks to coherently force perturbation rolls giving rise to an amplification
of the streamwise streak perturbation and through this feedback to an
instability of the combined roll/streak/turbulence complex. The dominant
turbulent perturbation structures involved in supporting the
roll/streak/turbulence complex instability are non-normal optimal perturbations
with the form of oblique waves. The cooperative linear instability giving rise
to the roll/streak structure arises at a bifurcation in the parameter of STM
excitation parameter. This structural instability eventually equilibrates
nonlinearly at finite amplitude and although the resulting statistical
equilibrium streamwise streaks are inflectional the associated flows are
stable. Formation and equilibration of the roll/streak structure by this
mechanism can be traced to the non-normality which underlies interaction
between perturbations and mean flows in modally stable systems.

vacuum corresponding to a scale-invariant spectrum of random classical
radiation in spacetime with the overall constant chosen to give an energy
(1/2)\hbar\omega per normal mode in inertial frames. Classical field theory
with classical zero-point radiation gives the same field correlation functions
as quantum field theory for the symmetrized products of the corresponding free
massless fields in inertial frames; however, the interpretations in classical
and quantum theories are quite different. Quantum field theory has photons in
thermal radiation but not in the vacuum state; classical theory has radiation
in both situations. The contrast in interpretations is most striking for the
Rindler coordinate frame accelerating through zero-point radiation; classical
theory continues tensor behavior over to the Rindler frame, whereas quantum
theory introduces a new Rindler vacuum state. The classical interpretation of
thermal behavior rests on two fundamental principles. i) A scale-invariant
distribution of random radiation cannot correspond to thermal radiation at
non-zero temperature. ii) A scale-invariant distribution of random radiation
can acquire a correlation time which reflects the parameters of a spacetime
trajectory through the scale-invariant radiation. Based on these principles,
classical theory finds no basis for an accelerating observer to reinterpret
zero-point radiation in terms of thermal radiation. In contrast, quantum field
theory claims that an observer uniformly accelerated through zero-point
flucturations of the Minkowski vacuum encounters a thermal bath at the
temperature T=\hbar a/(2\pi ck).

and the lightest pseudoscalar mesons. We first obtain the elementary
interaction amplitudes, or interacting kernels, without including any ad hoc
free parameter. This is achieved by using previous results on the nature of the
lightest scalar resonances as dynamically generated from the rescattering of
S-wave two-meson pairs. Afterwards, the interaction kernels are unitarized and
the final S-wave amplitudes result. We find that these interactions are very
rich and generate a large amount of pseudoscalar resonances that could be
associated with the K(1460), \pi(1300), \pi(1800), \eta(1475) and X(1835). We
also consider the exotic channels with isospin 3/2 and 1, having the latter
positive G-parity. The former could be also resonant in agreement with a
previous prediction.

  on Lattice Field Theory, Lattice2010","PoS Lattice2010:193,2010",,,"hep-ph hep-lat","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The curvature which characterizes the QCD phase transition at finite
temperature and small values of the chemical potential is accessible to lattice
simulations. The results for this quantity which have been obtained by several
different lattice simulation methods differ due to different numbers of
flavors, different pion masses and different sizes of the simulation volume. In
order to reconcile these results, it is important to investigate finite-volume
effects on the curvature. We investigate the curvature of the chiral phase
transition line at finite temperature and chemical potential in a finite
volume. We use a phenomenological model for chiral symmetry breaking and apply
non-perturbative functional renormalization group methods which account for
critical long-range fluctuations at the phase transition. We find an
intermediate volume region in which the curvature of the phase transition line
is actually reduced relative to its infinite-volume value, provided periodic
spatial boundary conditions are chosen for the quark fields. Size and location
of this region depend on the value of the pion mass. Such an effect could
account for differences in the curvature between lattice simulations in
differently sized volumes and from functional methods in the infinite volume
limit. We discuss implications of our results for the QCD phase diagram.

The response of the low-lying Ba 5p and Y 4p core electrons is shown to
interact strongly with the Cu 3d and O 2p excitations, with important
consequences on screening. The agreement between IXS and TDDFT results is
excellent, apart from a new type of excitations, mainly related to loosely

correlation mechanisms not fully described by TDDFT that might have a role in
giving rise to antiscreening.

at 18 and 25 microns with the 8-meter Gemini telescopes. These images confirm
the previously observed spatial extent seen in mid-IR, near-IR, and optical
images of the source. We detect brightness and temperature asymmetries such
that dust on the NE side is both brighter and warmer than dust in the SW. We
show that models of so-called pericenter glow account for these asymmetries,
thus both confirming and extending our previous analyses. In this scenario, the
center of the dust ring is offset from the star due to gravitational
perturbations of a body with an eccentric orbit that has induced a forced
eccentricity on the dust particle orbits. Models with 2-micron silicate dust
particles and a forced eccentricity of 0.06 simultaneously fit the observations
at both wavelengths. We also show that parameters used to characterize the
thermal-emission properties of the disk can also account for the disk asymmetry
observed in shorter-wavelength scattered-light images.

non-centrosymmetric superconductors with time-reversal symmetry by using three
different types of topological invariants. Due to the bulk boundary
correspondence, a non-zero value of any of these topological numbers indicates
the appearance of zero-energy Andreev surface states. We find that some of
these boundary modes in nodal superconducting phases are dispersionless, i.e.,
they form a topologically protected flat band. The region where the zero-energy
flat band appears in the surface Brillouin zone is determined by the projection
of the nodal lines in the bulk onto the surface. These dispersionless Andreev
surface bound states have many observable consequences, in particular, a
zero-bias conductance peak in tunneling measurements. We also find that in the
gapless phase there appear Majorana surface modes at time-reversal invariant
momenta which are protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant.

for DMM models and compare the results to that of minimal
supergravity/constrained MSSM (mSUGRA/CMSSM) models, building on previous
studies of Feldman, Liu, and Nath. Deflected mirage mediation is a
string-motivated scenario in which the soft terms include comparable
contributions from gravity mediation, gauge mediation, and anomaly mediation.
DMM allows a wide variety of phenomenologically preferred models with light
charginos and neutralinos, including novel patterns in which the heavy Higgs
particles are lighter than the lightest superpartner. We use this analysis to
motivate two DMM benchmark points to be used for more detailed collider
studies. One model point has a higgsino-dominated lightest superpartner and a
compressed yet heavy spectrum, while the other has a stau NLSP and similar
features to mSUGRA/CMSSM models, but with a slightly less stretched spectrum.
