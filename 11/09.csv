spatial distribution of blue straggler stars in the cluster. Blue stragglers
are stars observed to be hotter and bluer than other stars with the same
luminosity in their environment. As such, they appear to be much younger than
the rest of the stellar population. Two main channels have been suggested to
produce such stars: (1) collisions between stars in clusters or (2) mass
transfer between, or merger of, the components of primordial short-period
binaries. The spatial distribution of these stars inside a star cluster,
compared with the distribution of stars in different evolutionary stages, can
cast light on the most efficient production mechanism at work. In the case of
Arp~2, we found that blue straggler stars are significantly more concentrated
than main sequence stars, while they show the same degree of concentration as
evolved stars (either red giants or horizontal branch stars). Since Arp~2 is
not a very concentrated cluster, we suggest that this high central
concentration is an indication that blue stragglers are mostly primordial
binary stars.

satisfactory in terms of goodness of fit, interpretability, parsimoniousness,

we propose a comparison approach based on a set of criteria summarized in a

concerning particulate matter concentrations in Piemonte region (Italy) during

criteria for our case study we draw some conclusions. First, a model with a
complex hierarchical structure is globally preferable to one with a complex
spatio-temporal covariance function. Moreover, in the absence of suitable
computational resources, a model simple in structure and with a simple
covariance function can be chosen, since it shows good prediction performance
at reasonable computational costs.

the support of theoretical modeling of synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC)

simulations, the synchrotron radio, X-ray and IC gamma-ray emission from SNRs
expanding in non-uniform interstellar medium (ISM) and/or non-uniform
interstellar magnetic field (ISMF). As a first application, the code is used to
investigate the effects of non-uniform ISMF on the SNR morphology in the
non-thermal X-ray and gamma-ray bands. We perform 3D MHD simulations of a
spherical SNR shock expanding through a magnetized ISM with a gradient of
ambient magnetic field strength. The model includes an approximate treatment of
upstream magnetic field amplification and the effect of shock modification due
to back reaction of accelerated cosmic rays. From the simulations, we
synthesize the synchrotron radio, X-ray and IC gamma-ray emission with
REMLIGHT, making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and
injection of relativistic electrons. A gradient of the ambient magnetic field
strength induces asymmetric morphologies in radio, X-ray and gamma-ray bands
independently from the model of electron injection if the gradient has a
component perpendicular to the line-of-sight. The degree of asymmetry of the
remnant morphology depends on the details of the electron injection and
acceleration and is different in the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands. The
non-thermal X-ray morphology is the most sensitive to the gradient, showing the
highest degree of asymmetry. The IC gamma-ray emission is weakly sensitive to
the non-uniform ISMF, the degree of asymmetry of the SNR morphology being the
lowest in this band.

FLAMES. It comprises previously published data for 19 objects (Mieske et al.
2008) which we re-analysed, including 13 with available HST photometric data.
Using Virtual Observatory technologies we found archival HST images for two
more UCDs and then determined their structural properties. For all objects we
derived internal velocity dispersions, stellar population parameters, and
stellar mass-to-light ratios (M/L)* by fitting individual simple stellar
population (SSP) synthetic spectra convolved with a Gaussian against the
observed spectra using the NBursts full spectral fitting technique. For 14
objects we estimated dynamical masses suggesting no dark matter (DM) in 12 of
them and no more than 40 per cent DM mass fraction in the remaining two, in
contrast to findings for several UCDs in the Virgo cluster. Some Fornax UCDs
even have too high values of (M/L)* estimated using the Kroupa stellar initial
mass function (IMF) resulting in negative formally computed DM mass fractions.
The objects with too high (M/L)* ratios compared to the dynamical ones have
relatively short dynamical relaxation timescales, close to the Hubble time or
below. We therefore suggest that their lower dynamical ratios (M/L)dyn are
caused by low-mass star depletion due to dynamical evolution. Overall, the
observed UCD characteristics suggest at least two formation channels: tidal
threshing of nucleated dwarf galaxies for massive UCDs (~10^8 M_sun), and a
classical scenario of red globular cluster formation for lower-mass UCDs (<
10^7 M_sun).

frameworks. On the one hand the quantum pure state, i.e. the wavefunction, of
an isolated system which is determined to calculate molecular properties and to
consider the time evolution according to the unitary Schr\""odinger equation. On
the other hand a mixed state, i.e. a statistical density matrix, is the
standard formalism to account for thermal equilibrium, as postulated in the
microcanonical quantum statistics. In the present paper an alternative
treatment relying on a statistical analysis of the possible wavefunctions of an
isolated system is presented. In analogy with the classical ergodic theory, the
time evolution of the wavefunction determines the probability distribution in
the phase space pertaining to an isolated system. However, this alone cannot
account for a well defined thermodynamical description of the system in the
macroscopic limit, unless a suitable probability distribution for the quantum
constants of motion is introduced. We present a workable formalism assuring the
emergence of typical values of thermodynamic functions, such as the internal
energy and the entropy, in the large size limit of the system. This allows the
identification of macroscopic properties independently of the specific
realization of the quantum state. A description of material systems in
agreement with equilibrium thermodynamics is then derived without constraints
on the physical constituents and interactions of the system. Furthermore, the
canonical statistics is recovered in all generality for the reduced density
matrix of a subsystem.

and nova-like variables during outburst and occasionally during quiescence, and
have analogues in high-mass X-ray binaries and black-hole candidates. The
frequent low coherence of quasi-period oscillations and dwarf nova oscillations
can make detection with standard time-series tools such as periodograms
problematic. This paper develops tools to analyse quasi-periodic brightness
oscillations. We review the use of time-frequency representations in the
astronomical literature, and show that representations such as the
Choi-Williams Distribution and Zhao-Atlas-Marks Representation, which are best
suited to high signal-to-noise data, cannot be assumed a priori to be the best
techniques for our data, which have a much higher noise level and lower
coherence. This leads us to a detailed analysis of the time-frequency
resolution and statistical properties of six time-frequency representations. We
conclude that the wavelet scalogram, with the addition of wavelet ridges and
maxima points, is the most effective time-frequency representation for
analysing quasi-periodicities in low signal-to-noise data, as it has high
time-frequency resolution, and is a minimum variance estimator.
  We use the wavelet ridges method to re-analyse archival data from VW Hyi, and
find 62 new QPOs and 7 new long-period DNOs. Relative to previous analyses, our
method substantially improves the detection rate for QPOs.

the fraction of He atoms that end up in substitutional sites shortly after

original grayscale pixel is greater than or equal to the mask value and is
determined as white vice versa. To determine the optimal value of the mask on
each pixel for a given original grayscale image, we first assume that the
human-eyes might recognize the black and white binary halftoned image as the
corresponding grayscale one by linear filters. The Hamiltonian is constructed
as a distance between the original and the recognized images which is written
in terms of the threshold mask. We are confirmed that the system described by
the Hamiltonian is regarded as a kind of antiferromagnetic Ising model with
quenched disorders. By searching the ground state of the Hamiltonian, we obtain
the optimal threshold mask and the resulting halftoned binary dots
simultaneously. From the power-spectrum analysis, we find that the binary dots
image is physiologically plausible from the view point of human-eyes modulation
properties. We also propose a theoretical framework to investigate statistical
performance of inverse digital halftoning, that is, the inverse process of
halftoning. From the Bayesian inference view point, we rigorously show that the
Bayes-optimal inverse-halftoning is achieved on a specific condition which is
very similar to the so-called Nishimori line in the research field of spin
glasses.

Polarized Nano Regions (PNR) in the paraelectric phase of relaxor
ferroelectrics. Calculations have done in the frame of mean-field model early
supposed by E.Iolin & J.Toulouse but depolarization field effects, DF, were
taken into account. Elementary excitations of the system are found to be of two
types - Vortex (V) and Quasi Polar (QP). DF decreases temperature of the local
QP phase transition. The local phase transition temperature is found to be
lower (higher) for Vortex than for QP excitations for the case of small (large)
size PNR. Therefore both QP and Vortex condensations are possible.
Depolarization field hasn't effect on the Vortex scattering. For the case of QP
scattering DF effect is essential especially in the case when total angular
momentum j=1. Vortex and QP (at j \geq 2) cross section of scattering {\Sigma}
are nullified at the small value of momentum q of the incident wave. However QP
cross section {\Sigma}(j=1) is saturated at q~0.01-0.001, and nullified only at
the ultra small value of q corresponding macroscopic value of the soft mode
wavelength. This scattering leads to the suppression of the TO spreading wave
regime and allows qualitative understand some features of so-called waterfall

quantum information processors is dealing with quantum errors. Dynamical
decoupling is a particularly promising approach that complements conventional
quantum error correction by eliminating some correlated errors without the
overhead of additional qubits. In practice, the control pulses used for
decoupling are imperfect and thus introduce errors which can accumulate after
many pulses. These instrumental errors can destroy the quantum state. Here we
examine several dynamical decoupling sequences, and their concatenated
variants, using electron spin resonance of donor electron spins in a $^{28}$Si
crystal. All of the sequences cancel phase noise arising from slowly
fluctuating magnetic fields in our spectrometer, but only those sequences based
upon alternating $\pi$-rotations about the X- and Y-axes in the rotating frame
(XYXY sequences) demonstrate the ability to store an arbitrary quantum state.
By comparing the experimental results with a detailed theoretical analysis we
demonstrate that the superior performance of XYXY sequences arises from the
fact that they are self-correcting for the dominant instrumental pulse errors
in magnetic resonance experiments. We further find that concatenated sequences
perform better than the periodic variants, maintaining near 100% fidelities for
spin states even after several hundred control pulses. Intuitively, one would
expect the instrumental error to increase with the number of pulses in the
sequence but we show that the dominant first-order error does not increase when
concatenating the XYXY sequence.

questions, such as what is the origin of variability, what radius does
dissipation occur at, and how does efficient prompt emission occur. These
mechanisms also need to be consistent with how ultrarelativistic jets form and
stay baryon pure despite turbulence and electromagnetic reconnection near the
compact object and despite stellar entrainment within the collapsar model. We
use the latest magnetohydrodynamical models of ultrarelativistic jets to
explore some of these questions in the context of electromagnetic dissipation
due to the slow collisional and fast collisionless reconnection mechanisms, as
often associated with Sweet-Parker and Petschek reconnection, respectively. For
a highly magnetized ultrarelativistic jet and typical collapsar parameters, we
find that significant electromagnetic dissipation may be avoided until it
proceeds catastrophically near the jet photosphere at large radii ($r\sim
10^{13}--10^{14}{\rm cm}$), by which the jet obtains a high Lorentz factor
($\gamma\sim 100--1000), has a luminosity of $L_j \sim 10^{50}--10^{51}\ergs$,
has observer variability timescales of order 1s (ranging from 0.001-10s),
achieves $\gamma\theta_j\sim 10--20 (for opening half-angle $\theta_j$) and so
is able to produce jet breaks, and has comparable energy available for both
prompt and afterglow emission. This reconnection switch mechanism allows for
highly efficient conversion of electromagnetic energy into prompt emission and
associates the observed prompt GRB pulse temporal structure with dissipation
timescales of some number of reconnecting current sheets embedded in the
jet.[abridged]

shown that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) can be conveniently
described by a two-part power-law with an exponent alpha_2 = 2.3 for stars more
massive than about 0.5 Msol and an exponent of alpha_1 = 1.3 for less massive
stars. A consensus has also emerged that most, if not all, stars form in
stellar groups and star clusters, and that the mass function of these can be
described as a power-law (the embedded cluster mass function, ECMF) with an
exponent beta ~2. These two results imply that the integrated galactic IMF
(IGIMF) for early-type stars cannot be a Salpeter power-law, but that they must
have a steeper exponent. An application to star-burst galaxies shows that the
IGIMF can become top-heavy. This has important consequences for the
distribution of stellar remnants and for the chemo-dynamical and photometric
evolution of galaxies. In this contribution the IGIMF theory is described, and
the accompanying contribution by Pflamm-Altenburg, Weidner & Kroupa (this

recently been detected around disc galaxies. We compile samples of elliptical
and disc galaxies that have Chandra and XMM-Newton measurements, and compare
the scaling of the coronal X-ray luminosity (L_X) with both the K-band
luminosity (L_K) and the coronal X-ray temperature (T_X). The X-ray flux
measurements are corrected for non-thermal point source contamination by
spatial excision and spectral subtraction for resolved and unresolved sources
respectively. We find that the properties of the extended X-ray emission from
galaxies of different morphological types are similar: for both elliptical and
disc galaxies, the L_X - L_K and L_X - T_X relations have similar slope,
normalisation and scatter. The observed universality of coronal X-ray
properties suggests that the bulk of this emission originates from gas that has
been accreted, shock-heated and compressed during the assembly of the galaxy
and that outflows triggered by stellar processes make only a minor contribution
to the X-ray emission. This reservoir of cooling gas is a potential source of
morphological transformation; it provides a fresh supply of material for discs
to grow around galaxies of all morphological types.

evolution models of 1.5 to 2.8Msun with atomic diffusion (including radiative
accelerations) for all species within the OPAL opacity database were computed
and compared to observations of HAeBe stars. Atomic diffusion in the presence
of weak mass loss can explain the observed abundance anomalies of
pre-main-sequence stars, as well as the presence of binary systems with metal
rich primaries and chemically normal secondaries such as V380 Ori and HD72106.
This is in contrast to turbulence models which do not allow for abundance
anomalies to develop on the pre-main-sequence. The age at which anomalies can
appear depends on stellar mass. For A and F stars, the effects of atomic
diffusion can modify both the internal and surface abundances before the onset
of the MS. The appearance of important surface abundance anomalies on the
pre-main-sequence does not require mass loss, though the mass loss rate affects
their amplitude. Observational tests are suggested to decipher the effects of
mass loss from those of turbulent mixing. If abundance anomalies are confirmed
in pre-main-sequence stars they would severely limit the role of turbulence in

f(v) >= 0. We demonstrate the utility of this result in several ways. First, we
show a falling deconvoluted recoil spectrum (deconvoluted of the nuclear form
factor), such as from ordinary elastic scattering, can be ""mocked up"" by any
mass of dark matter above a kinematic minimum. As an example, we show that dark
matter much heavier than previously considered can explain the CoGeNT excess.
Specifically, m_chi < m_Ge} can be in just as good agreement as light dark
matter, while m_\chi > m_Ge depends on understanding the sensitivity of Xenon
to dark matter at very low recoil energies, E_R ~ 6 keVnr. Second, we show that
any rise in the deconvoluted recoil spectrum represents distinct particle
physics information that cannot be faked by an arbitrary f(v). As examples of
resulting non-trivial particle physics, we show that inelastic dark matter and

high surface brightness complexes defined by O'Connell & Mangano (1978). We
found that these complexes share the same star formation history and extinction
as the field stellar populations in the disk. There is an indication that the
stellar populations are marginally older at the outer disk (450 Myr at ~3 kpc)
as compared to the inner disk (100 Myr at 0.5 kpc). For the nuclear regions

simulate the effects of atmospheric turbulence, we generated six-layer phase
screens with the parameters estimated from the on-site measurements. For the
optics, we combined the ray-tracing tool ZEMAX and our simulated focal plane
data to introduce realistic aberrations and focal plane height fluctuations.
Although this expected flatness deviation for LSST is small compared with that
of other existing cameras, the fast f-ratio of the LSST optics makes this focal
plane flatness variation and the resulting PSF discontinuities across the CCD
boundaries significant challenges in our removal of the systematics. We resolve
this complication by performing PCA CCD-by-CCD, and interpolating the basis
functions using conventional polynomials. We demonstrate that this PSF
correction scheme reduces the residual PSF ellipticity correlation below 10^-7
over the cosmologically interesting scale. From a null test using HST/UDF
galaxy images without input shear, we verify that the amplitude of the galaxy
ellipticity correlation function, after the PSF correction, is consistent with
the shot noise set by the finite number of objects. Therefore, we conclude that
the current optical design and specification for the accuracy in the focal
plane assembly are sufficient to enable the control of the PSF systematics
required for weak-lensing science with the LSST.

black hole binary system in the centre of a galaxy. This is known to be
problematic for a prograde disc. We show that in contrast, interaction with a
retrograde circumbinary disc is considerably more effective in shrinking the
binary because there are no orbital resonances. The binary directly absorbs
negative angular momentum from the circumbinary disc by capturing gas into a
disc around the secondary black hole, or discs around both holes if the binary
mass ratio is close to unity. In many cases the binary orbit becomes eccentric,
shortening the pericentre distance as the eccentricity grows. In all cases the
binary coalesces once it has absorbed the angular momentum of a gas mass
comparable to that of the secondary black hole. Importantly, this conclusion is
unaffected even if the gas inflow rate through the disc is formally
super--Eddington for either hole. The coalescence timescale is therefore always
$\sim M_2/\dot M$, where $M_2$ is the secondary black hole mass and $\dot M$
the inflow rate through the circumbinary disc.

that are completely free of astrophysical uncertainties by focusing on {\em
integral} quantities, such as $g(v_{min})=\int_{v_{min}} dv\, f(v)/v $ and
$\int_{v_{thresh}} dv\, v g(v)$. Direct comparisons are possible when the
$v_{min}$ space probed by different experiments overlap. As examples, we
consider the possible dark matter signals at CoGeNT, DAMA and CRESST-Oxygen. We
find that expected rate from CoGeNT in the XENON10 experiment is higher than
observed, unless scintillation light output is low. Moreover, we determine that
S2-only analyses are constraining, unless the charge yield $Q_y< 2.4 {\, \rm
electrons/keV}$. For DAMA to be consistent with XENON10, we find for
$q_{Na}=0.3$ that the modulation rate must be extremely high ($\gsim 70%$ for
$m_\chi = 7\, \gev$), while for higher quenching factors, it makes an explicit
prediction (0.8 - 0.9 cpd/kg) for the modulation to be observed at CoGeNT.
Finally, we find CDMS-Si, even with a 10 keV threshold, as well as XENON10,
even with low scintillation, would have seen significant rates if the excess
events at CRESST arise from elastic WIMP scattering, making it very unlikely to
be the explanation of this anomaly.

It is based
on locating multi-stream flows, i.e. the places where the velocity field is
multi-valued. The method is local in Eulerian space, simple and computaionally
efficient. This technique uses the velocities of particles and thus takes into
account the dynamical information. This is in contrast with the majority of
standard methods that use the coordinates of particles only. Two quantities are
computed in every mesh cell: the mean and variance of the velocity field. In
the cells where the velocity is single-valued the variance must be equal to
zero exactly, therefore the cells with non-zero variance are identified as
multi-stream flows. The technique has been tested in a N-body simulation of the
\L CDM model. The preliminary analysis has shown that numerical noise does not
pose a significant problem. The web identified by the new method has been
compared with the web identified by the standard technique using only the
particle coordinates. The comparison has shown overall similarity of two webs
as expected, however they by no means are identical. For example, the
isocontours of the corresponding fields have significantly different shapes and
some density peaks of similar heights exhibit significant differences in the
velocity variance and vice versa. This suggest that the density and velocity
variance have a significant degree of independence. The shape of the
two-dimensional pdf of density and velocity variance confirms this proposition.
Thus, we conclude that the dynamical information probed by this technique
introduces an additional dimension into analysis of the web.

nucleon-nucleon (NN) bremsstrahlung reaction is presented. The resulting
amplitude is unitary as a matter of course and it is gauge invariant, i.e., it
satisfies a generalized Ward-Takahashi identity. The novel feature of this
approach is the consistent microscopic implementation of local gauge invariance
across all interaction mechanisms of the hadronic systems, thus serving as a
constraint for all subprocesses. The formalism is quite readily adapted to
approximations and thus can be applied even in cases where the microscopic
dynamical structure of the underlying interacting hadronic systems is either
not known in detail or too complex to be treated in detail. We point out how
the interaction currents resulting from the photon being attached to
nucleon-nucleon-meson vertices can be treated by phenomenological four-point
contact currents that preserve gauge invariance. In an advance application of
the present formalism [K. Nakayama and H. Haberzettl, PRC 80, 051001(R)
(2009)], such interaction currents were found to contribute significantly in
explaining experimental data. In addition, we provide a scheme that permits the
approximate treatment of current contributions resulting from pieces of the NN
interaction that cannot be incorporated exactly. In each case, the
approximation procedure ensures gauge invariance of the entire bremsstrahlung
amplitude. We also discuss the necessary modifications when taking into account
baryonic states other than the nucleon N; in detail, we consider the
$Delta(1232)$ resonance by incorporating the couplings of the $NN$ to the
$N\Delta$ and $\Delta\Delta$ systems, and the $\gamma N \to \Delta$
transitions. We apply the formalism to the 280-MeV bremsstrahlung data from

to the uniform monoclinic strain of the unit cell with one iron per cell, as
well as to the phonons at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. In the
magnetic phase the former gives rise to monoclinic distortion while the latter
induces dimerization of the ferromagnetic iron chains due to alternate
lengthening and shortening of the nearest-neighbour iron-iron bonds. We compare
this system with the iron arsenides and propose a microscopic magneto-elastic

that this describes electron-lattice coupling in a system where

and provide a new gamma-ray background in the early Universe. The IGM
ionization fraction x_ion and gas temperature T_m can be increased from the
recombination residual and adiabatically cooling in the absence of energy
injection to the highest value of x_ ion 0.1 and T_m ~ 5000 K at z>10 for the
upper bound UCMH abundance constrained by the CMB optical depth. A small
fraction of UCMHs are seeded by PBHs. The X-ray emission from gas accretion
onto PBHs may totally dominated over dark matter annihilation and become the
main cosmic ionization source, but the constraints of gas accretion rate and
X-ray absorption by the baryon accumulation within the UCMHs and accretion
feedback show that X-ray emission can only be a promising source much later
than UCMH annihilation at z<z_m<1000, where z_m depends on the masses of PBHs,
their host UCMHs, and the dark matter particles. Also, UCMH radiation including
both annihilation and X-ray emission can significantly suppress the low mass
first baryonic structure formation. The effects of UCMHs radiation on the
baryonic structure evolution are quite small for the gas temperature after
virialization, but more significant to enhance the gas chemical quantities such
as the ionization fraction and molecular hydrogen abundance in the baryonic
objects.

framework for the design of efficient securities markets over very large
outcome spaces. The challenge here is computational. In a complete market, in
which one security is offered for each outcome, the market institution can not
efficiently keep track of the transaction history or calculate security prices
when the outcome space is large. The natural solution is to restrict the space
of securities to be much smaller than the outcome space in such a way that
securities can be priced efficiently. Recent research has focused on searching
for spaces of securities that can be priced efficiently by existing mechanisms
designed for complete markets. While there have been some successes, much of
this research has led to hardness results. In this paper, we take a drastically
different approach. We start with an arbitrary space of securities with bounded
payoff, and establish a framework to design markets tailored to this space. We
prove that any market satisfying a set of intuitive conditions must price
securities via a convex potential function and that the space of reachable
prices must be precisely the convex hull of the security payoffs. We then show
how the convex potential function can be defined in terms of an optimization
over the convex hull of the security payoffs. The optimal solution to the
optimization problem gives the security prices. Using this framework, we
provide an efficient market for predicting the landing location of an object on
a sphere. In addition, we show that we can relax our ""no-arbitrage"" condition
to design a new efficient market maker for pair betting, which is known to be
#P-hard to price using existing mechanisms. This relaxation also allows the
market maker to charge transaction fees so that the depth of the market can be
dynamically increased as the number of trades increases.

Ho to a high degree of accuracy based upon Doppler tracking of spacecraft in

determine a model independent value of the Hubble constant for the current
epoch in the solar system to be Ho = 2.59 \pm 0.05 x 10^-18 (s^-1) or as 79.8
\pm 1.7 (km/s/Mpc).
  We calculate the direct effect of the Cosmic Redshift on Doppler tracking of
spacecraft in the solar system. It is shown that with current tracking systems,
such as NASA's Deep Space Tracking Network, when the return trip light time of
the Doppler signal exceeds a certain threshold, imposed by the stability of the
frequency standard, the effect of the Cosmic Redshift is coherently conserved
in the returning Doppler signal.
  We demonstrate that in an underdetermined orbit, one determined by line of
sight Doppler alone, that if this Cosmic Redshift term is not accounted for,
the orbit determination program (ODP) miscalculates the actual recessional
velocity of the spacecraft from the measured recessional velocity causing a
mismatch between the actual and the predicted trajectory of the spacecraft. One
consequence is that the ODP will generate Doppler residuals, the difference
between the actual trajectory and the predicted trajectory which show an
anomalous force. When this effect is integrated in long arc solutions, it can
grow to considerable magnitude. We show that the ODP residuals uniquely
separate the Cosmic Redshift term from velocity Doppler sources and that the
solution can provide an accurate determination of Ho.

these galaxies have had no detectable evolution since $z\sim0.6-0.7$, but we
also find that in the range $z=0.65-1$ at least 50% of the stars in bright
absorption systems are younger than 2.5Gyr. Faint absorption-line galaxies in
the cluster at $z = 0.29$ also had significant star formation during the
previous 2-3Gyr, while their brighter counterparts seem to be composed only of
old stars. At $z\sim0.8$, our dynamically young cluster had a truncated

LINER-like spectra with $\rm H\beta$ in absorption and a significant component

populations of young and intermediate-aged stars and are thus not related to
AGN, but to the population of `retired galaxies' recently identified by

also influence the ionisation balance of intergalactic metals; we extract
realistic quasar absorption spectra from a large hydrodynamical simulation to
examine their impact on intergalactic SiIV and CIV absorbers. Using a variety
of toy UVB models, we find that while the predicted spatial inhomogeneities in
spectral hardness have a significant impact on tau_HeII/tau_HI, the longer mean
free path for photons with frequencies above and below the HeII ionisation edge
means these fluctuations have less effect on the SiIV and CIV ionisation
balance. Furthermore, UVB models which produce the largest fluctuations in
specific intensity at the HeII ionisation edge also have the softest ionising
spectra, and thus result in photo-ionisation rates which are too low to produce
significant fluctuations in the observed tau_SiIV/tau_CIV. Instead, we find
spatial variations in the IGM metallicity will dominate any scatter in
tau_SiIV/tau_CIV. Our results suggest that observational evidence for
homogeneity in the observed tau_SiIV/tau_CIV distribution does not rule out the
possibility of significant fluctuations in the UVB spectral shape at z~2-3. On
the other hand, the scatter in metallicity inferred from observations of
intergalactic CIV and SiIV absorption at z~2-3 using spatially uniform
ionisation corrections is likely intrinsic, and therefore provides a valuable
constraint on intergalactic metal enrichment scenarios at these redshifts.

powered by an inner radiatively inefficient, advection-dominated accretion flow
(ADAF), an outer truncated thin disk, and a jet. Maoz (2007) recently
challenged this picture based on the observation that the strength of
ultraviolet emission relative to the X-ray and radio bands does not depart from
empirical trends defined by more luminous sources. He advocates that AGNs
across all luminosities have essentially the same accretion and radiative
processes, which in luminous sources are described by a standard optically
thick, geometrically thin disk. We calculate ADAF models and demonstrate that
they can successfully fit the observed spectral energy distributions of the
LLAGNs in Maoz's sample. Our model naturally accommodates the radio and X-ray
emission, and the ultraviolet flux is well explained by a combination of the
first-order Compton scattering in the ADAF, synchrotron emission in the jet,
and black body emission in the truncated thin disk. It is premature to dismiss
the ADAF model for LLAGNs. The UV data can be fit equally well using a standard
thin disk, but an additional corona and jet would be required to account for
the X-ray and radio emission. We argue that there are strong theoretical
reasons to prefer the ADAF model over the thin disk scenario. We discuss
testable predictions that can potentially discriminate between the two
accretion models.

highly overlapping structure is likely to exist in many social networks, such
as Facebook friendship networks. In this paper we present a scalable algorithm,
MOSES, based on a statistical model of community structure, which is capable of
detecting highly overlapping community structure, especially when there is
variance in the number of communities each node is in. In evaluation on
synthetic data MOSES is found to be superior to existing algorithms, especially
at high levels of overlap. We demonstrate MOSES on real social network data by
analyzing the networks of friendship links between students of five US
universities.

its state to one of Alice and Bob even when such merging is impossible. This
rate is provably better than the hashing bound for sufficiently pure tripartite

strategy consisting of entanglement distillation followed by entanglement
swapping. We demonstrate by the use of a simple example that our random
measurement strategy outperforms hierarchical distillation strategies when the
individual helper stations' states fail to individually factorize into portions
associated specifically with Alice and Bob. Finally, we use these results to
find achievable rates for the more general scenario, where many spatially

favor an expansion with a decreasing of the acceleration at $z<0.3$. However,
once the CMB data is added in the analysis, the cosmic acceleration is found to
be still increasing, indicating a tension between low redshift data and high
redshift one. In order to reduce this tension significantly, two different
methods are considered and thus two different subsamples of Union2 are
selected. We then find that two different subsamples+BAO+CMB give completely
different results on the cosmic expanding history when the systematic error is
ignored, with one suggesting a decreasing cosmic acceleration, the other just
the opposite, although both of them alone with BAO support that the cosmic
acceleration is slowing down. However, once the systematic error is considered,
two different subsamples of Union2 along with BAO and CMB all favor an
increasing of the present cosmic acceleration. Therefore a clear-cut answer on
whether the cosmic acceleration is slowing down calls for more consistent data

in the A-configuration in spectral-line mode were carried out at 0.1 arcsec
resolution by covering the redshifted velocity range of ~ 300 km/s with respect
to the systemic velocity of the galaxy. The purpose of these new observations
is twofold: to detect an H2O maser that an earlier VLA observation pinpointed
in the southern nucleus in the northern nucleus as well to clarify the
kinematics of the double nuclei, and to understand the origin of the maser in
the galaxy. In the second epoch, one velocity feature peaking at Vlsr=7491.1
km/s, redshifted by ~200 km/s relative to the systemic velocity, was detected
only toward the southern nucleus. The detection of an H2O maser feature at or
near this velocity had never been reported in earlier observations. However,
including the known velocity features at redshifted velocities, no other
velocity features were observed toward either nuclei throughout these epochs.
The maser remains unresolved at an angular resolution of ~ 0"".1, corresponding
to a linear size of less than about 45 pc. The two epochs of VLA observations
show that the maser intensity is variable on timescales of at least three
months, while the correlation between the maser intensity and the radio
continuum intensity is not certain from our data. It is plausible that the
maser in NGC 6240 is associated with the activity of an active galactic nucleus
in the southern nucleus. Alternatively, the maser can be explained by
starforming activity at the site of massive starformation in the galaxy.

as changes in both within youth and population averaged odds of moving forward.
Using a Bayesian paradigm, we consider various prior opinions about the unknown
year of the change in the pattern of prosecutors' decision. Based on the
available data, we make posteriori conclusions about whether a change-point has
occurred between 1992 and 1996 (inclusive), evaluate the degree of confidence
about the year of change-point, estimate the magnitude of the effects of the
change-point and other factors, and investigate other provocative questions

roots do not satisfy the slow motion assumption in the post-Newtonian
approximation and are thus discarded. This means that, especially for the
restricted three-body problem, exactly three positions of a third body are true
even at the post-Newtonian order. They are relativistic counterparts of the
Newtonian Lagrange points L1, L2 and L3. We show also that, for the same masses
and full length, the angular velocity of the post-Newtonian collinear
configuration is smaller than that for the Newtonian case. Provided that the
masses and angular rate are fixed, the relativistic end-to-end length is

Suppose that the index $(H:H^\circ)$ is prime to $p$ and that $p > 2\dim V-2$

semisimple $H$-module if and only if $H$ is $G$-completely reducible; (ii)
$H^\circ$ is reductive if and only if $H$ is $G$-completely reducible.

natural mechanism which accounts for both phenomena simultaneously. We use the
prisoner's dilemma games to mimic the interactions among the members of the
population. Each member is identified by its cooperation probability, and its
fitness is given by the payoffs from neighbors. The least fit member with the
minimum payoff is replaced by a new member with a random cooperation
probability. When the neighbors of the least fit member are also replaced with
a non-zero probability, a strong cooperation emerges. The Bak-Sneppen process
builds a self-organized structure so that the cooperation can emerge even in
the parameter region where a uniform or random population decreases the number
of cooperators. The emergence of cooperation is due to the same dynamical
correlation which leads to self-organized criticality in replacement
activities.

abundance of carbon monoxide (CO) is very sensitive to intrinsic properties of
the gaseous medium, such as density, metallicity, and the background UV field.
In order to accurately interpret CO observations, it is thus important to
understand how well CO traces the gas, which in molecular clouds (MCs) is
predominantly molecular hydrogen (H2). Recent hydrodynamic simulations by
Glover & Mac Low have explicitly followed the formation and destruction of
molecules in model MCs under varying conditions, confirming that CO formation
strongly depends on the cloud properties. Conversely, the H2 formation is
primarily determined by the age of the MC. We apply radiative transfer
calculations to these MC models in order to investigate the properties of CO
line emission. We focus on integrated CO (J=1-0) intensities emerging from
individual clouds, including its relationship to the total, H2, and CO column
densities, as well as the ""X factor,"" the ratio of H2 column density to CO
intensity. Models with high CO abundances have a threshold CO intensity ~65 K
km/s at sufficiently large extinctions. Clouds with low CO abundances show no
such intensity thresholds. The distribution of H2 column densities are well
described as log-normal functions, though the distributions of CO intensities
and column densities are usually not log-normal. In general, the PDFs of the
integrated intensity do not follow the distribution functions of CO column
densities. In the model with Milky Way-like conditions, the X factor is in
agreement with the near constant value determined from observations. In clouds
with lower CO abundances the X factor can vary appreciably - sometimes by > 4
orders of magnitude. In models with high densities, the CO line is fully
saturated, so that the X factor is directly proportional to the molecular
column density.

methylation patterns with each pattern coming from a single cell and
represented as an unordered pair of binary strings. The data are technically
difficult and time-consuming to collect, putting a premium on an efficient
inference method. Our aim is to estimate rates for the maintenance and de novo
methylation events that gave rise to the observed patterns, while accounting
for measurement error. We model data at multiple sites jointly, thus using
whole-strand information, and considerably reduce confounding between
parameters. We also adopt a hierarchical structure that allows for variation in
rates across sites without an explosion in the effective number of parameters.
Our context-specific priors capture the expected stationarity, or
near-stationarity, of the stochastic process that generated the data analyzed
here. This expected stationarity is shown to greatly increase the precision of
the estimation. Applying our model to a data set collected at the human FMR1
locus, we find that measurement errors, generally ignored in similar studies,
occur at a nontrivial rate (inappropriate bisulfite conversion error: 1.6$%$
with 80$%$ CI: 0.9--2.3$%$). Accounting for these errors has a substantial
impact on estimates of key biological parameters. The estimated average failure
of maintenance rate and daughter de novo rate decline from 0.04 to 0.024 and
from 0.14 to 0.07, respectively, when errors are accounted for. Our results
also provide evidence that de novo events may occur on both parent and daughter

of stars depend on some fundamental stellar properties, such as mass, radius,
luminosity, and chemical abundances. A classical way to test stellar interior
models is to compare the predicted and observed location of a star on
theoretical evolutionary tracks in a H-R diagram. This requires the best
possible determinations of stellar mass, radius, luminosity and abundances. To
derive its fundamental parameters, we observed the well-known rapidly
oscillating Ap star, $\gamma$ Equ, using the visible spectro-interferometer
VEGA installed on the optical CHARA array. We computed the calibrated squared
visibility and derived the limb-darkened diameter. We used the whole energy
flux distribution, the parallax and this angular diameter to determine the
luminosity and the effective temperature of the star. We obtained a
limb-darkened angular diameter of 0.564~$\pm$~0.017~mas and deduced a radius of
$R$~=~2.20~$\pm$~0.12~${\rm R_{\odot}}$. Without considering the multiple
nature of the system, we derived a bolometric flux of $(3.12\pm 0.21)\times
10^{-7}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ and an effective temperature of
7364~$\pm$~235~K, which is below the effective temperature that has been
previously determined. Under the same conditions we found a luminosity of
$L$~=~12.8~$\pm$~1.4~${\rm L_{\odot}}$. When the contribution of the closest
companion to the bolometric flux is considered, we found that the effective
temperature and luminosity of the primary star can be, respectively, up to
$\sim$~100~K and up to $\sim$~0.8~L$_\odot$ smaller than the values mentioned
above.These new values of the radius and effective temperature should bring
further constraints on the asteroseismic modelling of the star.

K-induced change cannot be explained with a simple rigid-band model of pristine
picene, but can be interpreted by molecular orbital calculations considering
electron-intramolecular-vibration interaction. Excellent agreement of the
K-doped spectrum with the calculations points to importance of
electron-intramolecular-vibration interaction in K-doped picene.

phase-type service time distribution and allow for customer abandonment. The
first set of limit theorems is for critically loaded $G/Ph/n+GI$ queues, where
the patience times are independent and identically distributed following a
general distribution. The next limit theorem is for overloaded $G/ Ph/n+M$
queues, where the patience time distribution is restricted to be exponential.
We prove that a pair of diffusion-scaled total-customer-count and
server-allocation processes, properly centered, converges in distribution to a
continuous Markov process as the number of servers $n$ goes to infinity. In the
overloaded case, the limit is a multi-dimensional diffusion process, and in the
critically loaded case, the limit is a simple transformation of a diffusion
process. When the queues are critically loaded, our diffusion limit generalizes
the result by Puhalskii and Reiman (2000) for $GI/Ph/n$ queues without customer
abandonment. When the queues are overloaded, the diffusion limit provides a
refinement to a fluid limit and it generalizes a result by Whitt (2004) for
$M/M/n/+M$ queues with an exponential service time distribution. The proof
techniques employed in this paper are innovative. First, a perturbed system is
shown to be equivalent to the original system. Next, two maps are employed in
both fluid and diffusion scalings. These maps allow one to prove the limit
theorems by applying the standard continuous-mapping theorem and the standard
random-time-change theorem.

presents a general yet simple mathematical framework that achieves all of this.
First, the general requirements of a satisfactory framework are outlined. Then,

obtained. These include combined MOEs, multiple and possibly conflicting user

  Series",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the evolution on the AGB, S-type stars are the first objects to
experience s-process nucleosynthesis and third dredge-ups, and therefore to
exhibit sprocess signatures in their atmospheres. Their significant mass loss
rates (10^-7 to 10^-6 M*/year) make them major contributors to the AGB
nucleosynthesis yields at solar metallicity. Precise abundance determinations
in S stars are of the utmost importance for constraining e.g. the third
dredge-up luminosity and efficiency (which has been only crudely parameterized
in all current nucleosynthetic models so far). Here, dedicated S-star model
atmospheres are used to determine precise abundances of key s-process elements,
and to set constraints on nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution models. A
special interest is paid to technetium, an element with no stable isotopes
(99Tc, the only isotope produced by the s-process in AGB stars, has a half-life
of 2.1 x 10^5 years). Its detection is considered as the best signature that
the star effectively populates the thermally-pulsing AGB phase of evolution.
The derived Tc/Zr abundances are compared, as a function of the derived [Zr/Fe]
overabundances, with AGB stellar model predictions. The [Zr/Fe] overabundances
are in good agreement with the model predictions, while the Tc/Zr abundances
are slightly overpredicted. This discrepancy can help to set better constraints
on nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution models of AGB stars.

w_p(r_p)n of photometric galaxies surrounding a set of
spectroscopically-identified galaxies, and simultaneously the projected
correlation function w_p(r_p) between the two populations. In this method we
are able to divide the photometric galaxies into subsamples in luminosity
intervals when redshift information is unavailable, enabling us to measure
w_p(r_p)n and w_p(r_p) as a function of not only the luminosity of the
spectroscopic galaxy, but also that of the photometric galaxy. Extensive tests
show that our method can measure w_p(r_p) in a statistically unbiased way. The
accuracy of the measurement depends on the validity of the assumption in the
method that the foreground/background galaxies are randomly distributed and
thus uncorrelated with those galaxies of interest. Therefore, our method can be
applied to the cases where foreground/background galaxies are distributed in
large volumes, which is usually valid in real observations. We applied our
method to data from SDSS including a sample of 10^5 LRGs at z~0.4 and a sample
of about half a million galaxies at z~0.1, both of which are cross-correlated
with a deep photometric sample drawn from the SDSS. On large scales, the
relative bias factor of galaxies measured from w_p(r_p) at z~0.4 depends on
luminosity in a manner similar to what is found at z~0.1, which are usually
probed by autocorrelations of spectroscopic samples. On scales smaller than a
few Mpc and at both z~0.4 and z~0.1, the photometric galaxies of different
luminosities exhibit similar density profiles around spectroscopic galaxies at
fixed luminosity and redshift. This provides clear support for the assumption
commonly-adopted in HOD models that satellite galaxies of different

distribution within their host halos.

K$_{\alpha}$ and K$_{\beta}$ lines from low ionized iron. We consider two
cases: non-rotating black hole, and black hole rotating with almost maximum
spin a=0.98, and obtain spectra for five accretion disks from hard X-rays to
the infrared. In non irradiated disks, resonance lines from He-like and H-like
iron appear mostly in absorption. Such disk spectra exhibit limb-darkening in
the whole energy range. External irradiation causes that iron resonance lines
appear in emission. Furthermore, depending on disk effective temperature,
fluorescent iron K$_{\alpha}$ and K$_{\beta}$ lines are present in disk
emitting spectra.All models with irradiation exhibit limb-brightening in their
X-ray reflected continua. We show, that the disk around stellar black hole
itself is hot enought to produce strong absorption resonance lines of iron.
Emission lines can be observed only if heating by external X-rays dominates
over thermal processess in hot disk atmosphere. Irradiated disks are usually
brighter in X-ray continuum when seen edge on, and fainter when seen face on.

basis of its optical emission-line spectrum superposed on a K8-type
photosphere, and its photometric variability. The mid-infrared spectral index
of LkHa 188-G4 indicates a Class II-type object. LkHa 188-G4 exhibited a steady
rise by ~1 mag over ~11 months starting in Aug. 2009, before a subsequent more
abrupt rise of > 3 mag on a time scale of ~2 months. Observations taken during
the eruption exhibit the defining characteristics of FU Orionis variables: (i)
an increase in brightness by > 4 mag, (ii) a bright optical/near-infrared
reflection nebula appeared, (iii) optical spectra are consistent with a G
supergiant and dominated by absorption lines, the only exception being Halpha
which is characterized by a P Cygni profile, (iv) near-infrared spectra
resemble those of late K--M giants/supergiants with enhanced absorption seen in
the molecular bands of CO and H_2O, and (v) outflow signatures in H and He are
seen in the form of blueshifted absorption profiles. LkHa 188-G4 is the first
member of the FU Orionis-like class with a well-sampled optical to mid-infrared
spectral energy distribution in the pre-outburst phase. The association of the
PTF 10qpf outburst with the previously identified classical T Tauri star LkHa
188-G4 (HBC 722) provides strong evidence that FU Orionis-like eruptions
represent periods of enhanced disk accretion and outflow, likely triggered by
instabilities in the disk. The early identification of PTF 10qpf as an FU
Orionis-like variable will enable detailed photometric and spectroscopic
observations during its post-outburst evolution for comparison with other known

structure prediction for the highly variable loop and turn regions. Such
modeling is difficult due to the fact that the number of known protein
structures available to estimate these torsion angle distributions is typically
small. Furthermore, the data is ""sparse"" in that not all proteins have angle
pairs at each sequence position. We propose a new semiparametric model for the

accommodates sparse data by leveraging known information about the behavior of

optically thick magnetized accretion disk around central black hole. The
polarization degree is very sensitive to the spin of black hole - for Kerr
rotating hole the polarization is higher than for Schwarzschild non-rotating
one if both holes have the same luminosities and masses. The reason of this
effect is that the radius of the first stable orbit for non-rotating hole is
equal to three gravitational radiuses, and for fast rotating Kerr hole is
approximately 6 times lesser. Magnetic field, decreasing from first stable
orbits, is much larger in the region of escaping of optical radiation for the
case of Schwarzschild hole than for Kerr one. Large magnetic field gives rise
to large depolarization of radiation due to Faraday rotation effect. This
explains the mentioned result. It seems that the ensemble of objects with
observed polarization mostly consists of Kerr black holes.

pulsars are characterized by high energy loss rates from ~3 \times 10^{33} erg

significant emission, seven of these likely being of magnetospheric origin. The
detection of significant emission in the off-pulse interval offers new

three other sources with significant emission are the Crab Nebula, Vela-X and a

mutants of a high fitness ""master"" genotype. Mutants are assumed to have lower
fitness than the master type, yet they coexist with it forming the
quasi-species. When the mutation rate is sufficiently high, the master type no
longer survives and gets replaced by a wide range of mutant types, thus
destroying the quasi-species. It is the so-called ""error catastrophe"". But
natural selection acts on phenotypes, not genotypes, and huge amounts of
genotypes yield the same phenotype. An important consequence of this is the
appearance of beneficial mutations which increase the fitness of mutants. A
model has been recently proposed to describe quasi-species in the presence of
beneficial mutations. This model lacks the error catastrophe of Eigen's model
and predicts a steady state in which the viral population grows exponentially.
Extinction can only occur if the infectivity of the quasi-species is so low
that this exponential is negative. In this work I investigate the transient of
this model when infection is started from a small amount of low fitness
virions. I prove that, beyond an initial regime where viral population
decreases (and can go extinct), the growth of the population is
super-exponential. Hence this population quickly becomes so huge that selection
due to lack of host cells to be infected begins to act before the steady state
is reached. This result suggests that viral infection may widespread before the
virus has developed its optimal form.

operate directly on particle configurations without an intermediate step (e.g.,
calculation of pair distribution functions): in this way, all information

against those of other known methods showed that the new method combined
several favourable properties: an arbitrary q-scale, scattering curves free of
truncation artifacts and good behaviour down to the theoretical lower limit of
the q-scale. A test of computational efficiency was also performed to establish
a relative scale between the speeds of all known methods: the reciprocal
lattice approach, the brute force method, the Fourier transform approach and

2700 < Teff < 4000 K with 0.5 < C/O < 0.99. ZrO and TiO band strength indices
as well as VJHKL photometry are needed to disentangle Teff, C/O and [s/Fe]. A
""best-model finding tool"" was developed using a set of well-chosen indices and
checked against photometry as well as low- and high-resolution spectroscopy. It
is found that applying M-star model atmospheres (i.e., with a solar C/O ratio)
to S stars can lead to errors on Teff up to 400K. We constrain the parameter
space occupied by S stars of the vast sample of Henize stars in terms of Teff,

galaxy nearest to the supernova (SN) in terms of angular distance whose
velocity difference from the SN is less than 1000 km s^{-1}. Eighty seven SN Ia
host galaxies are selected from the SDSS Main galaxy sample with the apparent
r-band magnitude m_r < 17.77, and compared with the SDSS Main galaxies. The SN
Ia rates for early and late-type galaxies are 0.81 +- 0.19 SN (100yr)^{-1} and
0.99 +- 0.21 SN (100yr)^{-1}, respectively. We find that the host galaxies have
a color distribution consistent with that of the Main galaxies, regardless of
their morphology. However, host galaxies are on average brighter than the Main
galaxies by ~ 0.3 mag over the range of -18.3 > M_r > -21.3. But the brighter
ends of their luminosity distributions are similar. The distribution of the
distance to the nearest neighbor galaxy shows that SNe Ia are more likely to
occur in isolated galaxies without close neighbors. We also find that the SN Ia
host galaxies are preferentially located in a region close to massive galaxy
clusters compared to the Main galaxies.

this paper we present the overall results of a HARPS (a high-precision
spectrograph mostly dedicated to deriving precise radial velocities) program to
search for planets orbiting a sample of 104 metal-poor stars (selected [Fe/H]
below -0.5). Radial velocity time series of each star are presented and
searched for signals using several statistical diagnostics. Stars with detected
signals are presented, including 3 attributed to the presence of previously
announced giant planets orbiting the stars HD171028, HD181720, and HD190984.
Several binary stars and at least one case of a coherent signal caused by
activity-related phenomena are presented. One very promising new, possible
giant planet orbiting the star HD107094 is discussed, and the results are
analyzed in light of the metallicity-giant planet correlation. We conclude that
the frequency of giant planets orbiting metal-poor stars may be higher than
previously thought, probably reflecting the higher precision of the HARPS
survey. In the metallicity domain of our sample, we also find evidence that the
frequency of planets is a steeply rising function of the stellar metal content,
as found for higher metallicity stars.

modelling of a sample of starburst radio galaxies in the context of scenarios
for the triggering of the activity and the evolution of the host galaxies. The
starburst radio galaxies -- comprising ~15 - 25% of all powerful extragalactic
radio sources -- frequently show disturbed morphologies at optical wavelengths,
and unusual radio structures, although their stellar masses are typical of
radio galaxies as a class. In terms of the characteristic ages of their young
stellar populations (YSP), the objects can be divided into two groups: those
with YSP ages t_ysp < 0.1 Gyr, in which the radio source has been triggered
quasi-simultaneously with the main starburst episode, and those with older YSP
in which the radio source has been triggered or re-triggered a significant
period after the starburst episode. Combining the information on the YSP with
that on the optical morphologies of the host galaxies, we deduce that the
majority of the starburst radio galaxies have been triggered in galaxy mergers
in which at least one of the galaxies is gas rich. However, the triggering (or
re-triggering) of the radio jets can occur immediately before, around, or a
significant period after the final coalescence of the merging nuclei,
reflecting the complex gas infall histories of the merger events. Overall, our
results provide further evidence that powerful radio jet activity can be
triggered via a variety of mechanisms, including different evolutionary stages
of major galaxy mergers; clearly radio-loud AGN activity is not solely
associated with a particular stage of a unique type of gas accretion event.

However, the lack of rigorous modeling of periodic expression as well as the
lack of a comprehensive model for integrating information across genes and
experiments has impaired the effort for the accurate identification of
periodically expressed genes. To address the problem, we introduce a Bayesian
model to integrate multiple independent microarray data sets from three recent
genome-wide cell cycle studies on fission yeast. A hierarchical model was used
for data integration. In order to facilitate an efficient Monte Carlo sampling
from the joint posterior distribution, we develop a novel Metropolis--Hastings
group move. A surprising finding from our integrated analysis is that more than
40% of the genes in fission yeast are significantly periodically expressed,
greatly enhancing the reported 10--15% of the genes in the current literature.
It calls for a reconsideration of the periodically expressed gene detection

features showing both the OVII K alpha triplet and OVIII Ly alpha line, which
constitute a typical signature of the warm hot gas. Our analysis shows that 1
Ms long exposures and energy resolution of 2.5 eV will allow us to detect about
400 such features per deg^2 with a significance >5 sigma and reveals that these
emission systems are typically associated with density ~100 above the mean. The
temperature can be estimated from the line ratio with a precision of ~20%. The
combined effect of contamination from other lines, variation in the level of
the continuum, and degradation of the energy resolution reduces these
estimates. Yet, with an energy resolution of 7 eV and all these effects taken
into account, one still expects about 160 detections per deg^2. These line
systems are sufficient to trace the spatial distribution of the line-emitting
gas, which constitute an additional information, independent from line
statistics, to constrain the poorly known cosmic chemical enrichment history
and the stellar feedback processes.

the form of a Fredholm equation whose kernel is singular on its diagonal when
represented by a basis bearing a continuum of states, such as in a
Fourier-Bessel transform. Several methods have been devised to tackle this
difficulty, from simply removing the infinite-range of the Coulomb potential
with a screening or cut function to using discretizing schemes which take
advantage of the integrable character of Coulomb kernel singularities. However,
they have never been tested in the context of Berggren bases, which allow
many-body nuclear wave functions to be expanded, with halo or resonant
properties within a shell model framework. It is thus the object of this paper
to test different discretization schemes of the Coulomb potential kernel in the
framework of complex-energy nuclear physics. For that, the Berggren basis
expansion of proton states pertaining to the sd-shell arising in the A ~ 20
region, being typically resonant, will be effected. Apart from standard
frameworks involving a cut function or analytical integration of singularities,
a new method will be presented, which replaces diagonal singularities by finite
off-diagonal terms. It will be shown that this methodology surpasses in
precision the two former techniques.

this work, we provide a new example of bound information in a four-partite

find a stable matching with high probability. In particular we allow the number
of couples to grow at a near-linear rate. Furthermore, truth-telling is an
approximated equilibrium in the game induced by the new matching algorithm. Our
results are tight: for markets in which the number of couples grows at a linear

its historical and chronological context, in order to highlight connections
between the architectural choices, the religious ideas and the traditions
inspiring the reign of the corresponding pharaohs. A close, explicit connection
with the double building projects carried out more than six centuries before by
Snefru at Dahshur and at Meidum-Seila comes out. This connection involved
geometry, perspective and astronomical alignments in the progressive planning
of the pyramidal complexes. In such a context, the architectural choices of the
last great king of the dynasty, Amenemhet III - who built two pyramids, one at
Dahshur and the other at Hawara - appear to be due mostly to symbolic, as
opposed to practical, reasons.

in a space. A shape forms a 3D process when combined with a behaviour.
Behaviours are specified with a timed CCS-like process algebra using a notion
of channel that models naturally binding sites on the surface of shapes.
Processes can represent molecules or other mobile objects and can be part of
networks of processes that move simultaneously and interact in a given
geometrical space. The calculus embeds collision detection and response,
binding of compatible 3D processes and splitting of previously established
bonds. In this work the full formal timed operational semantics of the calculus
is provided, together with examples that illustrate the use of the calculus in
a well-known biological scenario. Moreover, a result of well-formedness about
the evolution of a given network of well-formed 3D processes is proved.
