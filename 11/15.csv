atmospheric cosmic ray muons is a promising technique for detecting and imaging
heavily shielded high-Z nuclear materials such as enriched uranium. This
technique could complement standard radiation detection portals currently
deployed at international borders and ports, which are not very sensitive to
heavily shielded nuclear materials. We image small targets in 3D using $2\times
2 \times 2 mm^3$ voxels with a minimal muon tomography station prototype that
tracks muons with Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors read out in 2D with
x-y microstrips of 400 micron pitch. With preliminary electronics, the GEM
detectors achieve a spatial resolution of 130 microns in both dimensions. With
the next GEM-based prototype station we plan to probe an active volume of ~27
liters. We present first results on reading out all 1536 microstrips of a $30
\times 30 cm^2$ GEM detector for the next muon tomography prototype with final
frontend electronics and DAQ system. This constitutes the first full-size
implementation of the Scalable Readout System (SRS) recently developed
specifically for Micropattern Gas Detectors by the RD51 collaboration. Design
of the SRS and first performance results when reading out GEM detectors are
presented.

zero. Klivans & Spielman (STOC 2001) observed that the problem is open even
when k is a constant. This case has been subjected to a serious study over the

  We give the first polynomial time blackbox algorithm for this problem. Our

is a CL^0(M)-module for any real a; it is an algebra only if a is a

dependence on the spin structure of the scattering potential. We propose three
universality classes of scattering for the side jump contribution, having the
characters of being spin-independent, spin-conserving and spin-flip
respectively. For each individual class, the side jump contribution takes a
different unique value. When two or more classes of scattering are present, the
value of side jump is no longer fixed but varies as a function of their
relative disorder strength. As system control parameter such as temperature
changes, due to the competition between different classes of disorder
scattering, the side jump Hall conductivity could flow from one class dominated
limit to another class dominated limit. Our result indicates that magnon
scattering plays a role distinct from normal impurity scattering and phonon
scattering in the anomalous Hall effect because they belong to different

computers built entirely out of linear-optical elements -- cannot be

linear-optical network, then nonadaptively measured to count the number of
photons in each mode. This model is not known or believed to be universal for
quantum computation, and indeed, we discuss the prospects for realizing the
model using current technology. On the other hand, we prove that the model is
able to solve sampling problems and search problems that are classically
intractable under plausible assumptions. Our first result says that, if there
exists a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the same
probability distribution as a linear-optical network, then P^#P=BPP^NP, and
hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Unfortunately,
this result assumes an extremely accurate simulation. Our main result suggests
that even an approximate or noisy classical simulation would already imply a
collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. For this, we need two unproven
conjectures: the ""Permanent-of-Gaussians Conjecture"", which says that it is
#P-hard to approximate the permanent of a matrix A of independent N(0,1)
Gaussian entries, with high probability over A; and the ""Permanent
Anti-Concentration Conjecture"", which says that |Per(A)|>=sqrt(n!)/poly(n) with
high probability over A. We present evidence for these conjectures, both of
which seem interesting even apart from our application. This paper does not

find that the water vapor measured toward 77 spatial positions along the

with known cloud surface tracers such as CN, C2H, 13CO J =5-4, and HCN, and
less well with the volume tracer N2H+. Moreover, at total column densities
corresponding to Av < 15 mag., the ratio of H2O to C18O integrated intensities
shows a clear rise approaching the cloud surface. We show that this behavior
cannot be accounted for by either optical depth or excitation effects, but
suggests that gas-phase water abundances fall at large Av. These results are
important as they affect measures of the true water-vapor abundance in

limit, we introduce phenomenologically impurity scattering, with relaxation
time $\tau$. $\sigma_{xx}(\Omega)$ satisfies the $f$-sum rule. For the
infinitely peaked spin correlation function, $\chi(\mathbf{q})\propto
\delta(\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{Q})$, we recover the expressions for the

correlation length $\xi$ is large but finite, both $\sigma_{xx}$ and
$\sigma_{xy}$ show behaviors characteristic of the state with long-range order.
The calculation runs into difficulty for $\Omega\lesssim 1/\tau$. The
difficulties are traced to an inaccurate treatment of the very low energy

under the disk at the bright spot. In this conference proceeding, we focus on
whether the average white dwarf has enough mass to prevent a disk tilt in
non-magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) with accretion disks. Assuming a white
dwarf mass of 0.6M$_{\odot}$ and a disk mass of 10$^{-11}$M$_{\odot}$, we vary
the secondary mass to establish theoretical minimum mass transfer rates needed
to induce and maintain a disk tilt of four degrees around the line of nodes.
For mass ratios in the range \( (0.13 \le q=M_{2}M^{-1} \le 0.45) \), we
confirm that the secondary mass does not contribute significantly to disk tilt.
We also confirm that the average white dwarf does not have enough mass to
prevent a disk tilt. We find that disk tilt may be likely in low mass transfer

not follow this trend, with high values found toward the CND, as well as the
GMCs. By comparing our abundances with those of prototypical Galactic sources
we conclude that HNCO, similar to SiO, is ejected from grain mantles into
gas-phase by nondissociative C-shocks. This results in the high abundances
measured toward the CND and the GMCs. However, the strong UV radiation from the
Central cluster utterly photodissociates HNCO as we get closer to the center,
whereas SiO seems to be more resistant against UV-photons or it is produced
more efficiently by the strong shocks in the CND. Finally, we discuss the
possible connections between the molecular gas at the CND and the GMCs using
the HNCO/SiO, SiO/CS, and HNCO/CS intensity ratios as probes of distance to the

multi-output (MIMO) systems are able to provide both spatial multiplexing gain

Since group-decodable (quasi-orthogonal) code structure can reduce the decoding
complexity, we present in this paper systematic methods to construct
group-decodable high-rate STBC with full symbol-wise diversity gain for
arbitrary transmit antenna number and code length. We show that the proposed
group-decodable STBC can achieve high code rate that increases almost linearly
with the transmit antenna number, and the slope of this near-linear dependence
increases with the code length. Comparisons with existing low-rate and
high-rate codes (such as orthogonal STBC and algebraic STBC) are conducted to
show the decoding complexity reduction and good code performance achieved by
the proposed codes.

publication, the lift force has been suggested to be a source to disk tilt, a
source that is likely relevant to all accretion disk systems. Lift is generated
by slightly different supersonic gas stream speeds flowing over and under the
disk at the bright spot. In this conference proceeding, we focus on whether a
brown dwarf donor star accreting onto a white dwarf primary has enough mass to
contribute to disk tilt. We also would like to obtain whether a white dwarf -
brown dwarf close binary system has enough mass to induce and maintain a disk
tilt of four degrees. We adopt SDSS 103533.03+055158.4 as our model system
which has a mass transfer rate of ((10\pm2) \times 10^{-12}) M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$. We find that the brown dwarf in SDSS 1035 does not have enough mass
to contribute to disk tilt. We find a gross magnitude of the minimum mass
transfer rate to be $\sim10^{-10}$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. We conclude that SDSS
1035 does not seem to have a high enough mass transfer rate to induce and
maintain an observable disk tilt. Hence one reason why brown dwarf donor
systems may be so difficult to find could be due to their low mass transfer
rates which do not induce observable dynamical effects that is typical in white
dwarf-red dwarf CVs.

through simulations in full numerical relativity. Two initial data sequences
are studied in detail: one that leads to scattering and one that leads to a
grazing collision and merger. In all cases, the initial black hole spins lie in
the orbital plane, a configuration that leads to the so-called ""superkicks"". In
astrophysical, quasicircular inspirals, such kicks can be as large as ~3,000
km/s; here, we find configurations that exceed ~15,000 km/s. We find that the
maximum recoil is to a good approximation proportional to the total amount of
energy radiated in gravitational waves, but largely independent of whether a
merger occurs or not. This shows that the mechanism predominantly responsible
for the superkick is not related to merger dynamics. Rather, a consistent
explanation is that the ""bobbing"" motion of the orbit causes an asymmetric
beaming of the radiation produced by the in-plane orbital motion of the binary,
and the net asymmetry is balanced by a recoil. We use our results to formulate
some conjectures on the ultimate kick achievable in any black hole encounter.

could be from a tidal torque by the secondary on a misaligned accretion disk.
However, a source to cause and maintain disk tilt is unknown. In this work, we
show that accretion disks can tilt due to a force called lift. Lift results
from differing gas stream supersonic speeds over and under an accretion disk.
Because lift acts at the disk's center of pressure, a torque is applied around
a rotation axis passing through the disk's center of mass. The disk responds to
lift by pitching around the disk's line of nodes. If the gas stream flow ebbs,
then lift also ebbs and the disk attempts to return to its original
orientation.
  To first approximation, lift does not depend on magnetic fields or radiation
sources but does depend on mass and the surface area of the disk. Also, for
disk tilt to be initiated, a minimum mass transfer rate must be exceeded. For
example, a $10^{-11}M_{\odot}$ disk around a 0.8$M_{\odot}$ compact central
object requires a mass transfer rate greater than
$\sim10^{-13}$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, a value well below known mass transfer
rates in Cataclysmic Variable Dwarf Novae systems that retrogradely precess and
that exhibit negative superhumps in their light curves and a value well below
mass transfer rates in protostellar forming systems.

selected sample of 13 such objects, termed as very narrow line Seyfert\,1

emission line is at most weak in these objects. A soft X-ray excess is
ubiquitous, with the thermal temperatures falling within a strict range of
0.1--0.2\,keV. Our result highlights the puzzling independence of the thermal
temperature by extending the relations to even smaller FWHM(\hb), i.e., smaller
\mbh\ ($\sim 10^6$ \msun) and/or higher \redd. The excess emission can be
modeled by a range of viable models, though the disk reflection and
Comptonization models generally give somewhat better fits over the smeared
absorption and the $p$-free models. At the Eddington ratios around unity and
above, the X-ray spectral slopes in the 2--10\,keV band are systematically
flatter than the Risaliti et al.'s predictions of the relationship with \redd\
suggested previously. Short timescale (1--2 hours) X-ray variability is common,
which, together with the variability amplitude computed for some of the
objects, are supportive of the scenario that NLS1s are indeed AGN with
relatively small \mbh.

extremely massive stars, with spectral classifications Ofpe/WN9 (AX

generated in a colliding-wind binary system. For both AX J144701-5919 and AX

with a softer spectrum. These properties are consistent with a colliding-wind
binary interpretation for these two sources also, but other mechanisms for the
generation of X-rays cannot be excluded. There are many other as yet
unidentified X-ray sources in the Galactic plane, with X-ray properties similar
to those seen for AX J163252-4746, AX J184738-0156, AX J144701-5919 and AX

gives us a power-savings for \sigma<1. This test of the Ratios Conjecture
introduces complications not seen in previous cases (due to the level of the
elliptic curve). Further, the results here are one of the key ingredients in
the companion paper [DHKMS2], where they are used to determine the effective
matrix size for modeling zeros near the central point for this family. The
resulting model beautifully describes the behavior of these low lying zeros for
finite conductors, explaining the data observed by Miller in [Mil3].
  A key ingredient in our analysis is a generalization of Jutila's bound for
sums of quadratic characters with the additional restriction that the
fundamental discriminant be congruent to a non-zero square modulo a square-free
integer M. This bound is needed for two purposes. The first is to analyze the
terms in the explicit formula corresponding to characters raised to an odd
power. The second is to determine the main term in the 1-level density of
quadratic twists of a fixed form on GL_n. Such an analysis was performed by
Rubinstein [Rub], who implicitly assumed that Jutila's bound held with the
additional restriction on the fundamental discriminants; in this paper we show
that assumption is justified.

X-ray instruments is not the same for centrally-peaked and flat objects, which
introduces a bias in flux-limited cluster samples. We quantify this effect in
the case of a well-known cluster sample, HIFLUGCS. We simulate a population of
X-ray clusters with various surface-brightness profiles, and use the
instrumental characteristics of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) to select
flux-limited samples similar to the HIFLUGCS sample and predict the expected
bias. For comparison, we also estimate observationally the bias in the HIFLUGCS
sample using XMM-Newton and ROSAT data. We find that the selection of X-ray
cluster samples is significantly biased ($\sim29%$) in favor of the peaked,
Cool-Core (CC) objects, with respect to Non-Cool-Core (NCC) systems.
Interestingly, we find that the bias affects the low-mass, nearby objects
(groups, poor clusters) much more than the more luminous objects (i.e massive
clusters). We also note a moderate increase of the bias for the more distant
systems. Observationally, we propose to select the objects according to their
flux in a well-defined physical range excluding the cores,
$0.2r_{500}-r_{500}$, to get rid of the bias. From the fluxes in this range, we
reject 13 clusters out of the 64 in the HIFLUGCS sample, none of which appears
to be NCC. As a result, we estimate that less than half (35-37%) of the galaxy
clusters in the local Universe are strong CC. In the paradigm where the CC
objects trace relaxed clusters as opposed to unrelaxed, merging objects, this
implies that to the present day the majority of the objects are not in a
relaxed state. From this result, we estimate a rate of heating events of
$\sim1/3$ Gyr$^{-1}$ per dark-matter halo.

dynamics defined on networks is to detect communities, and numerous methods
have been developed separately to identify community structure in different
classes of networks, such as unipartite networks, bipartite networks, and
directed networks. We show that both unipartite and directed networks can be
represented as bipartite networks, and their modularity is completely
consistent with that for bipartite networks, the detection of modular structure
on which can be reformulated as modularity maximization. To optimize the
bipartite modularity, we develop a modified adaptive genetic algorithm (MAGA),
which is shown to be especially efficient for community structure detection.
The high efficiency of the MAGA is based on the following three improvements we
make. First, we introduce a different measure for the informativeness of a
locus instead of the standard deviation, which can exactly determine which loci
mutate. This measure is the bias between the distribution of a locus over the
current population and the uniform distribution of the locus, i.e., the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between them. Second, we develop a reassignment
technique for differentiating the informative state a locus has attained from
the random state in the initial phase. Third, we present a modified mutation
rule which by incorporating related operation can guarantee the convergence of
the MAGA to the global optimum and can speed up the convergence process.
Experimental results show that the MAGA outperforms existing methods in terms
of modularity for both bipartite and unipartite networks.

being present, are often used in modeling the distribution of a species as a
function of a set of explanatory variables---whether to map species occurrence,
to understand its association with the environment, or to predict its response
to environmental change. Currently, ecologists most commonly analyze
presence-only data by adding randomly chosen ""pseudo-absences"" to the data such
that it can be analyzed using logistic regression, an approach which has
weaknesses in model specification, in interpretation, and in implementation. To
address these issues, we propose Poisson point process modeling of the
intensity of presences. We also derive a link between the proposed approach and
logistic regression---specifically, we show that as the number of
pseudo-absences increases (in a regular or uniform random arrangement),
logistic regression slope parameters and their standard errors converge to
those of the corresponding Poisson point process model. We discuss the
practical implications of these results. In particular, point process modeling
offers a framework for choice of the number and location of pseudo-absences,
both of which are currently chosen by ad hoc and sometimes ineffective methods
in ecology, a point which we illustrate by example.

class of species abundance data for such modeling. Here, we propose a
multi-stage Bayesian hierarchical model for explaining species abundance over
this region. Our model is specified at areal level, where the CFR is divided
into roughly $37{,}000$ one minute grid cells; species abundance is observed at
some locations within some cells. The abundance values are ordinally
categorized. Environmental and soil-type factors, likely to influence the
abundance pattern, are included in the model. We formulate the empirical
abundance pattern as a degraded version of the potential pattern, with the
degradation effect accomplished in two stages. First, we adjust for land use
transformation and then we adjust for measurement error, hence
misclassification error, to yield the observed abundance classifications. An
important point in this analysis is that only $28%$ of the grid cells have been
sampled and that, for sampled grid cells, the number of sampled locations
ranges from one to more than one hundred. Still, we are able to develop
potential and transformed abundance surfaces over the entire region. In the
hierarchical framework, categorical abundance classifications are induced by
continuous latent surfaces. The degradation model above is built on the latent
scale. On this scale, an areal level spatial regression model was used for
modeling the dependence of species abundance on the environmental factors.

series of CZT detector modules (OMS40G256) manufactured by Orbotech Medical
Solutions (OMS), Israel, are used in the RT-2/CZT payload onboard the
CORONAS-PHOTON satellite. The CZT detectors, sensitive in the energy range of
20 keV to 150 keV, are used to image solar flares in hard X-rays. Since these
modules are essentially manufactured for commercial applications, we have
carried out a series of comprehensive tests on these modules so that they can
be confidently used in space-borne systems. These tests lead us to select the
best three pieces of the 'Gold' modules for the RT-2/CZT payload. This paper
presents the characterization of CZT modules and the criteria followed for
selecting the ones for the RT-2/CZT payload. The RT-2/CZT payload carries,
along with three CZT modules, a high spatial resolution CMOS detector for high
resolution imaging of transient X-ray events. Therefore, we discuss the
characterization of the CMOS detector as well.

design of experiments in such studies to assume uncorrelated errors for each
subject. In the present paper a new approach is introduced to determine
efficient designs for nonlinear least squares estimation which addresses the
problem of correlation between observations corresponding to the same subject.
We use asymptotic arguments to derive optimal design densities, and the designs
for finite sample sizes are constructed from the quantiles of the corresponding
optimal distribution function. It is demonstrated that compared to the optimal
exact designs, whose determination is a hard numerical problem, these designs
are very efficient. Alternatively, the designs derived from asymptotic theory
could be used as starting designs for the numerical computation of exact
optimal designs. Several examples of linear and nonlinear models are presented
in order to illustrate the methodology. In particular, it is demonstrated that
naively chosen equally spaced designs may lead to less accurate estimation.

from other molecules (e.g., CH3OH and N2D+) present in the observed bands, were
analysed using both the standard type rotation diagram analysis and, in
selected cases, a more elaborate method of solving the radiative transfer for
optically thick emission. In addition to molecular column densities, the
analysis also estimates the kinetic temperature and H2 density. Toward the SM1
core in rho Oph A, the H2CO deuterium fractionation is very high. In fact, the
observed D2CO/HDCO ratio is 1.34+/-0.19, while the HDCO/H2CO ratio is
0.107+/-0.015. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that the D2CO/HDCO
abundance ratio is observed to be greater than 1. The kinetic temperature is in
the range 20-30 K in the cores of rho Oph A, and the H2 density is (6-10)x10^5

(1-4)x10^23 cm-2. As depleted gas-phase chemistry is not adequate, we suggest
that grain chemistry, possibly due to abstraction and exchange reactions along

on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a central component of disease monitoring.
The increasing number of HIV-infected subjects starting therapy and the limited
capacity to support CD4 count testing within resource-limited settings have
fueled interest in identifying correlates of CD4 count change such as total
lymphocyte count, among others. The application of modeling techniques will be
essential to this endeavor due to the typically nonlinear CD4 trajectory over
time and the multiple input variables necessary for capturing CD4 variability.
We propose a prediction-based classification approach that involves first stage
modeling and subsequent classification based on clinically meaningful
thresholds. This approach draws on existing analytical methods described in the
receiver operating characteristic curve literature while presenting an
extension for handling a continuous outcome. Application of this method to an
independent test sample results in greater than 98% positive predictive value
for CD4 count change. The prediction algorithm is derived based on a cohort of
$n=270$ HIV-1 infected individuals from the Royal Free Hospital, London who
were followed for up to three years from initiation of ART. A test sample
comprised of $n=72$ individuals from Philadelphia and followed for a similar
length of time is used for validation. Results suggest that this approach may
be a useful tool for prioritizing limited laboratory resources for CD4 testing
after subjects start antiretroviral therapy.

rotated in the forward region in the opposite direction than in the backward

between the forward and backward rapidity regions is about 20deg for the
central and 10deg for the mid-peripheral collisions. The hydrodynamic expansion
of a torqued fireball leads to a torqued collective flow, yielding, in turn,
torqued principal axes of the transverse-momentum distributions at different

particles in different rapidity regions, which should allow for a quantitative

establish estimation and model selection consistency results and provide

families of complex structures studied in

of Kaehler polarizations to the vertical polarization, we show that, under this
degeneration, the half-form corrected $L^{2}$-normalized monomial holomorphic

Bohr-Sommerfeld fibers. This result and the limit of the corrected connection,
with curvature singularities along the boundary of $P_X$, justifies the direct
definition we give for the corrected quantization in the singular real toric

on assessing the relationship between longitudinal measurements and time to an
event. Recently, various authors have proposed joint modeling approaches for
longitudinal and time-to-event data for a single longitudinal variable. These
joint modeling approaches become intractable with even a few longitudinal
variables. In this paper we propose a regression calibration approach for
jointly modeling multiple longitudinal measurements and discrete time-to-event
data. Ideally, a two-stage modeling approach could be applied in which the
multiple longitudinal measurements are modeled in the first stage and the
longitudinal model is related to the time-to-event data in the second stage.
Biased parameter estimation due to informative dropout makes this direct
two-stage modeling approach problematic. We propose a regression calibration
approach which appropriately accounts for informative dropout. We approximate
the conditional distribution of the multiple longitudinal measurements given
the event time by modeling all pairwise combinations of the longitudinal
measurements using a bivariate linear mixed model which conditions on the event
time. Complete data are then simulated based on estimates from these pairwise
conditional models, and regression calibration is used to estimate the
relationship between longitudinal data and time-to-event data using the
complete data. We show that this approach performs well in estimating the
relationship between multivariate longitudinal measurements and the
time-to-event data and in estimating the parameters of the multiple
longitudinal process subject to informative dropout. We illustrate this
methodology with simulations and with an analysis of primary biliary cirrhosis
(PBC) data.

that the unique fixed point, i.e. the unique potential generating a given
density, is reached as the limiting point of an iterative procedure. The
one-to-one correspondence between densities and potentials is a straightforward
result provided that the response function of the divergence of the internal

be proven as well provided that the operator norms of the response functions of
the members of the iterative sequence of potentials have an upper bound. The
densities under consideration have second time-derivatives that are required to
satisfy a condition slightly weaker than being square-integrable. This approach
avoids the usual restrictions of Taylor-expandability in time of the uniqueness
theorem by Runge and Gross [Phys.Rev.Lett.52, 997 (1984)] and of the existence

That quest has suddenly come to a halt due to fundamental bounds applied by
physical laws. But, demand for more and more computational power is still
prevalent in the computing world. As a result, the microprocessor industry has
started exploring the technology along a different dimension. Speed of a single
work unit (CPU) is no longer the concern, rather increasing the number of
independent processor cores packed in a single package has become the new
concern. Such processors are commonly known as multi-core processors. Scaling
the performance by using multiple cores has gained so much attention from the

discovered in our observations. Four other stars GH Lup, l Car, T Mon and X Cyg
show tentative evidence for extended infrared emission. An unusual elongated
extended object next to SZ Tau appears to be a background or foreground object
in a chance alignment with the Cepheid. The inferred mass loss rates upper
limits for S Mus and delta Cep are in the range from 1e-9 to 1e-8 Msun/yr, with
the upper limit for RS Pup as high as 1e-6 Msun/yr. Mass loss during
post-main-sequence evolution has been proposed as a resolution to the
discrepancy between pulsational and dynamical masses of Cepheid variable stars:
dust in the lost material would make itself known by the presence of an
infrared bright nebula, or unresolved infrared excess. The observed frequency
of infrared circumstellar emission (<24%) and the mass loss rate we estimate
for our sources shows that dusty mass loss can only account for part of the
Cepheid mass loss discrepancy. Nevertheless, our direct evidence that mass loss
is active during the Cepheid phase is an important confirmation that these
processes need to be included in evolutionary and pulsation models of these
stars, and should be taken into account in the calibration of the Cepheid
distance scale.

metallic nanoparticles having concurrently atomic disorder, dilution and
competing interactions, are studied in the framework of an Ising model. We have
used both the free energy variational principle based on the Bogoliubov
inequality and Monte Carlo simulation. As a case of study for random diluted
nanoparticles we have considered the Fe$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.1}$Al$_{0.4}$ alloy
characterized for exhibiting, under bulk conditions, low temperature reentrant
spin glass (RSG) behavior and for which experimental and simulation results are
available. Our results allow concluding that the variational model is
successful in reproducing features of the particle size dependence of the Curie
temperature for both pure and random diluted particles. In this last case, low
temperature magnetization reduction was consistent with the same type of RSG
behavior observed in bulk in accordance with the Almeida-Thouless line at low
fields and a linear dependence of the freezing temperature with the reciprocal
of the particle diameter was also obtained. Computation of the correlation
length critical exponent yielded the values $\nu=0.926\pm 0.004$ via Bogoliubov
and$ \nu =0.71\pm 0.04$ via Monte Carlo. This fact indicates that even though
thermodynamical models can be indeed used in the study of nanostructures and
they can reproduce experimental features, special attention must be paid
regarding critical behavior. From both approaches, differences in the $\nu$

phases of hominid development, starting with a phase of biological evolution
characterised by rather rapid increase of the size of the brain. This has been
followed by a phase of even more rapid technological evolution and concomitant
expansion of the size of the population, that began when our own particular
`sapiens' species emerged, just a few hundred thousand years ago. The present
investigation exploits the analogy between the neo-Darwinian genetic evolution
mechanism governing the first phase, and the memetic evolution mechanism
governing the second phase. From the outset of the latter until very recently
-- about the year 2000 -- the growth of the global population N was roughly
governed by an equation of the form dN/Ndt= N/T*, in which T* is a coefficient
introduced (in 1960) by von Foerster, who evaluated it empirically as about two
hundred thousand million years. It is shown here how the value of this hitherto
mysterious timescale governing the memetic phase is explicable in terms of what
happenned in the preceding genetic phase. The outcome is that the order of
magnitude of the Foerster timescale can be accounted for as the product of the
relevant (human) generation timescale, about 20 years, with the number of bits
of information in the genome, of the order of ten thousand million. Whereas the
origin of our `homo' genus may well have involved an evolutionary hard step, it
transpires that the emergence of our particular `sapiens' species was rather an
automatic process.

set of implications towards the stability of the D-term potentials, defined for
a set of abelian scalar fields. In particular, we show that the nature of
marginal and threshold walls of stabilities may be investigated by real
geometric methods. Interestingly, we find that the leading order contributions
may easily be accomplished by translations of the Fayet parameter.
Specifically, we notice that the various possible linear, planar, hyper-planar
and the entire moduli space stabilities may easily be reduced to certain
polynomials in the Fayet parameter. For a set of finitely many real scalar
fields, it may be further inferred that the intrinsic scalar curvature defines
the global nature and range of vacuum correlations. Whereas, the underlying
moduli space configuration corresponds to a non-interacting basis at the zeros
of the scalar curvature, where the scalar fields become un-correlated. The
divergences of the scalar curvature provide possible phase structures, viz.,
wall of stability, phase transition, if any, in the chosen moduli
configuration. The present analysis opens up a new avenue towards the
stabilizations of gauge and string moduli.

the double Pareto lognormal (dPlN) distribution which has been proposed as a
model for heavy-tailed phenomena. We apply our approach to estimate the
$\mathit{dPlN}/M/1$ and $M/\mathit{dPlN}/1$ queueing systems. These systems
cannot be analyzed using standard techniques due to the fact that the dPlN
distribution does not possess a Laplace transform in closed form. This
difficulty is overcome using some recent approximations for the Laplace
transform of the interarrival distribution for the $\mathit{Pareto}/M/1$
system. Our procedure is illustrated with applications in internet traffic
analysis and risk theory.

Emission and absorption line profiles which are formed in the
interaction of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars and their circumstellar
environment are found to be variable at various timescales. Aims. We
investigate the patterns and timescales of temporal line profile variability in
order to explore the dynamical circumstellar environment of the PMS Herbig Ae
star V351 Ori. Methods.We obtained 45 high-resolution (R~28,000) spectra of
V351 Ori at timescales of hours, days, and months.We analysed the H\alpha line
profiles and also examined the H\beta, NaD1 and NaD2 line profiles to explore
the nature of the spectroscopic variability. Results. The H\alpha line profiles
showed strong variations over all timescales. The shape of the profiles changed
over timescales of a day. Single as well as simultaneous event(s) of
blue-shifted and red-shifted transient absorption components (TACs), i.e.
signatures of outflow and infall, were also observed in the H\alpha line
profiles. The shortest period of variation in the TACs was < 1 hour. All
transient absorption events were found to decelerate with a rate of a few to
fractions of m s-2. The depth and width of the TACs were also changing with
time. The presence of elongated red-shifted components at some epochs supports
the episodic nature of accretion. Conclusions. Variable emission and absorption
components detected in H\alpha line profiles show the dynamic nature of
interaction between V351 Ori and its circumstellar environment. The H\alpha
non-photospheric profiles of the star most probably originate in the disk wind.
Episodic accretion of gaseous material at a slow rate and outflow of clumpy
gaseous material are still occurring in V351 Ori at an age of ~6.5 Myr. Dynamic
magnetospheric accretion and disk wind emerge as the most satisfactory model
for interpreting the observed line profile variations of V351 Ori.

saturation value depends on the plasma temperature of converging flow. We
self-consistently calculate the Compton cloud (CC) plasma temperature as a
function of mass accretion rate using the energy balance between energy
dissipation and Compton cooling. We explain the observable phenomenon, index-
mdot correlations using a Monte-Carlo simulation of radiative processes in the
innermost part (CC) of a BH source and we account for the Comptonization
processes in the presence of thermal and bulk motions, as basic types of plasma
motion. We show that, when mdot increases, BH sources evolve to high and very
soft states (HSS and VSS, respectively), in which the strong blackbody-like and
steep power-law components are formed in the resulting X-ray spectrum. The
simultaneous detections of these two components strongly depends on sensitivity
of high energy instruments, given that the relative contribution of the hard
power-law tail in the resulting VSS spectrum can be very low, which is why, to
date {\it RXTE} observations of the VSS X-ray spectrum has been characterized
by the presence of the strong BB-like component only. We also predict specific
patterns for high-energy efold (cutoff) energy (E_{fold}) evolution with mdot
for thermal and dynamical (bulk) Comptonization cases. For the former case,
E_{fold} monotonically decreases with mdot, in the latter case, the
E_{fold}-decrease is followed by its increase at high values of mdot. The
observational evolution of E_{fold} vs mdot can be one more test for the
presence of a converging flow effect in the formation of the resulting spectra
in the close vicinity of BHs.

gamma-ray pulsars, it becomes possible to look for statistical properties of
their pulsed high-energy emission, especially their light-curves and
phase-resolved spectra. These pulsars emit by definition mostly gamma-ray
photons but some of them are also detected in the radio band. For those seen in
these two extreme energies, the relation between time lag of radio/gamma-ray
pulses and gamma-ray peak separation, in case both high-energy pulses are seen,
helps to put some constrain on the magnetospheric emission mechanisms and
location. This idea is analyzed in detail in this paper, assuming a polar cap
model for the radio pulses and the striped wind geometry for the pulsed
high-energy counterpart.
  Combining the time-dependent emissivity in the wind, supposed to be inverse
Compton radiation, with a simple polar cap emission model along and around the
magnetic axis, we compute the radio and gamma-ray light-curves, summarizing the
results in several phase plots. The phase lag as well as the gamma-ray peak
separation dependence on the pulsar inclination angle and on the viewing angle
are studied. Using the gamma-ray pulsar catalog compiled from the Fermi data,
we are able to predict the radio lag/peak separation relation and compare it

multi-way arrays with rank at most $R$ is not closed. Nonexistence of the best
low-rank approximation results in diverging rank-1 components when an attempt
is made to compute the approximation. Recently, a solution to this problem has
been proposed for real $I\times J\times 2$ arrays. Instead of a best rank-$R$
approximation the best fitting Generalized Schur Decomposition (GSD) is
computed. Under the restriction of nonsingular upper triangular matrices in the
GSD, the set of GSD solutions equals the interior and boundary of the rank-$R$
set. Here, we show that this holds even without the restriction. We provide a
complete classification of interior, boundary, and exterior points of the
rank-$R$ set of real $I\times J\times 2$ arrays, and show that the set of GSD
solutions equals the interior and boundary of this set.

  high-dimensional co-expression networks","28 pages, 9 figures",,,,"stat.AP q-bio.MN stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a technique to characterize differentially expressed genes in
terms of their position in a high-dimensional co-expression network. The set-up
of Gaussian graphical models is used to construct representations of the
co-expression network in such a way that redundancy and the propagation of
spurious information along the network are avoided. The proposed inference
procedure is based on the minimization of the Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC) in the class of decomposable graphical models. This class of models can
be used to represent complex relationships and has suitable properties that
allow to make effective inference in problems with high degree of complexity
(e.g. several thousands of genes) and small number of observations (e.g.
10-100) as typically occurs in high throughput gene expression studies. Taking
advantage of the internal structure of decomposable graphical models, we
construct a compact representation of the co-expression network that allows to
identify the regions with high concentration of differentially expressed genes.
It is argued that differentially expressed genes located in highly
interconnected regions of the co-expression network are less informative than
differentially expressed genes located in less interconnected regions. Based on
that idea, a measure of uncertainty that resembles the notion of relative
entropy is proposed. Our methods are illustrated with three publically
available data sets on microarray experiments (the larger involving more than
50,000 genes and 64 patients) and a short simulation study.
