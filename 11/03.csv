effective two nucleon potentials and the genuine two nucleon potentials
correspond to the three nucleon system effect, part of which is originated from
the three nucleon force. The calculation is performed using Nf=2 clover fermion

both of parity-even and parity-odd two nucleon potentials are provided. Since
parity-odd two nucleon potentials are not available in lattice QCD at this

purely dipolar magnetic field in a fluid star. They considered the effect of
cutting the star in half along a plane containing the symmetry axis and
rotating each half by $90\degr$ in opposite directions, which would cause the
energy of the magnetic field in the exterior of the star to be greatly reduced,
just as it happens with a pair of aligned magnets. We formally solve for the
energy of the external magnetic field and check that it decreases monotonously
along the entire rotation. We also describe the instability using perturbation
theory, and see that it happens due to the work done by the interaction of the
magnetic field with surface currents. Finally, we consider the stabilising
effect of adding a toroidal field by studying the potential energy perturbation
when the rotation is not done along a sharp cut, but with a continuous
displacement field that switches the direction of rotation across a region of
small but finite width. Using these results, we estimate the relative strengths
of the toroidal and poloidal field needed to make the star stable to this
displacement and see that the energy of the toroidal field required for
stabilisation is much smaller than the energy of the poloidal field. We also
show that, contrary to a common argument, the Flowers-Ruderman instability

indicate that gravity at short distances is effectively two-dimensional. If
this were true, and the energy scale at which the dimensional transition occurs
is of the order of the inflationary one, it is reasonable to investigate
eventual signatures in the primordial perturbation spectra. In this paper we
look at this possibility by assuming that the inflationary era was preceded by
an effectively two-dimensional evolution of the Universe. We model the
transition with a mode matching and we show that, in this case, no
observational signatures are expected in the tensor and scalar power spectra
nor in their ratio. We also show that assuming modified dispersion relations
before the matching between two sets of four-dimensional modes leads to similar
results.

magneto-inductive arrays is presented. The response of N-dimensional
rectangular arrays is first found as an excitation of eigenmodes. This
analytical method involves approximating the effect of sources and detectors,
and replaces the problem of solving large numbers of simultaneous equations
with that of evaluating a sum. Expressions are given for the modal expansion
coefficients, and in the low-loss case it is shown that the coefficient values
depend only on the difference in reciprocal frequency space of the operating
frequency from the resonant frequency of each mode. Analytic expressions are
then derived for quasi-optical quantities such as the spatial frequency
response, point-spread function and resolving power, and their implications for
imaging fidelity and resolution are examined for arrays of different dimension.
The results show clearly that there can be no useful image transfer for in-band
excitation. Out-of-band excitation allows image transfer. Provided the array is
larger than the expected image by at least the size of the point spread
function, the effect of the array boundaries may be ignored and imaging is
determined purely by the properties of the medium. However, there is a tradeoff
between fidelity and throughput, and good imaging performance using thick slabs
depends on careful choice of the operating frequency. The approximate analytic
method is verified by comparison of exact numerical solution.

regression error term E of the model Y=m(X)+E, assuming its independence with
the covariate X. The difficulty linked to this study is the fact that the
regression error E is not observed. In a such setup, it would be unwise, for
estimating f, to use a conditional approach based upon the probability
distribution function of Y given X. Indeed, this approach is affected by the
curse of dimensionality, so that the resulting estimator of the residual term E
would have considerably a slow rate of convergence if the dimension of X is
very high. Two approaches are proposed in this thesis to avoid the curse of
dimensionality. The first approach uses the estimated residuals, while the
second integrates a nonparametric conditional density estimator of Y given X.
If proceeding so can circumvent the curse of dimensionality, a challenging
issue is to evaluate the impact of the estimated residuals on the final
estimator of the density f. We will also attempt to determine the pointwise
rate of convergence of our proposed estimators. One our main aims is to
characterize the optimal choices of the first and second step bandwidths used

reduced if plasticity initiates in the soft material. A series of specimens
with the soft layer at different depths enables the depth at which plasticity
initiates to be mapped. InGaAs lattice-matched to InP is used, and the soft
layer is 320nm of strained-layer InGaAs superlattice. Under nanoindentation, we
find that plastic yield initiates throughout a region ranging from 300nm to
over 1um depending on the indenter tip radius. The region matches the depth
range over which the stress exceeds the yield stress of the InGaAs. Thus a
requirement for yield is an overload, or excess stress, throughout a finite

defined in terms of a reference Hamiltonian, which is a purely diagonal matrix
consisting of a fixed one-body term and includes the diagonal of the perturbing
$k$-body embedded ensemble matrix, and the perturbed Hamiltonian which includes
the residual off-diagonal elements of the $k$-body interaction. This choice
mimics the typical mean-field basis used in many calculations. We study
separately the cases $k=2$ and $3$. We compute the ensemble-averaged fidelity
decay as well as the fidelity of typical members with respect to an initial
random state. Average fidelity displays a revival at the Heisenberg time,
$t=t_H=1$, and a freeze in the fidelity decay, during which periodic revivals
of period $t_H$ are observed. We obtain the relevant scaling properties with
respect to the number of bosons and the strength of the perturbation. For
certain members of the ensemble, we find that the period of the revivals during
the freeze of fidelity occurs at fractional times of $t_H$. These fractional
periodic revivals are related to the dominance of specific $k$-body terms in

circumstellar envelopes and an increase in radio flux with time can be expected
as a result of the progression of the ionisation front. Such a behaviour has
been found in IRAS 18062+2410, whose radio modelling has allowed us to
determine that its ionised mass has increased from 10^{-4} to 3.3 10^{-4} M_sun
in 8 years and its envelope has become optically thin at lower frequencies.
  Different temporal behaviours have been found for three other sources. IRAS
17423-1755 has shown a possibly periodic pattern and an inversion of its radio
spectral index, as expected from a varying stellar wind. We estimate that the
radio flux arises from a very compact region around the central star (10^{15}
cm) with an electron density of 2 10^6 cm^{-3}. IRAS 22568+6141 and 17516-2525
have decreased their radio flux densities of about 10% per year over 4 years.
  While a linear increase of the flux density with time points out to the
progression of the ionisation front in the envelope, decreases as well as
quasi-periodic patterns may indicate the presence of unstable stellar
winds/jets or thick dusty envelopes absorbing ionising photons.

with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance

clocks where the objectives of players are described using parity conditions.
The games are \emph{concurrent} in that at each turn, both players
independently propose a time delay and an action, and the action with the
shorter delay is chosen. To prevent a player from winning by blocking time, we
restrict each player to play strategies that ensure that the player cannot be
responsible for causing a zeno run. First, we present an efficient reduction of
these games to \emph{turn-based} (i.e., not concurrent) \emph{finite-state}
(i.e., untimed) parity games. Our reduction improves the best known complexity
for solving timed parity games. Moreover, the rich class of algorithms for
classical parity games can now be applied to timed parity games. The states of
the resulting game are based on clock regions of the original game, and the
state space of the finite game is linear in the size of the region graph.
  Second, we consider two restricted classes of strategies for the player that
represents the controller in a real-time synthesis problem, namely,
\emph{limit-robust} and \emph{bounded-robust} winning strategies. Using a
limit-robust winning strategy, the controller cannot choose an exact
real-valued time delay but must allow for some nonzero jitter in each of its
actions. If there is a given lower bound on the jitter, then the strategy is
bounded-robust winning. We show that exact strategies are more powerful than
limit-robust strategies, which are more powerful than bounded-robust winning
strategies for any bound. For both kinds of robust strategies, we present
efficient reductions to standard timed automaton games. These reductions
provide algorithms for the synthesis of robust real-time controllers.

collection of local extensions, each defined on a small square, which if chosen
to be mutually consistent can be patched together to form a global extension

consistency is not applicable due to the (generically) non-local structure of

field, Hc2(0), for the 122 iron pnictides is in fact rather isotropic. Here, we
report measurements of the temperature dependence of the electrical
resistivity, \Gamma(T), in Ba0.5K0.5Fe2As2 and Ba0.68K0.32Fe2As2 single
crystals in zero magnetic field and for Ba0.68K0.32Fe2As2 as well in static and
pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T. We find that the resistivity of both
compounds in zero field is well described by an exponential term due to
inter-sheet umklapp electron-phonon scattering between light electrons around
the M point to heavy hole sheets at the \Gamma point in reciprocal space. From
our data, we construct an H-T phase diagram for the inter-plane (H || c) and
in-plane (H || ab) directions for Ba0.68K0.32Fe2As2. Contrary to published data
for underdoped 122 FeAs compounds, we find that Hc2(T) is in fact anisotropic
in optimally doped samples down to low temperatures. The anisotropy parameter,
{\gamma} = Habc2/Hcc2, is about 2.2 at Tc. For both field orientations we find
a concave curvature of the Hc2 lines with decreasing anisotropy and saturation
towards lower temperature. Taking into account Pauli spin paramagnetism we
perfectly can describe Hc2(T) and its anisotropy.

Peccei-Quinn (PQ) transformations. Since PQ transformations do not belong to
the d=4 U-duality group G4, in symmetric cases they generally have a
non-trivial action on the unique quartic invariant polynomial I4 of the charge
representation R of G4. This leads to interesting phenomena in relation to
theory of extremal black hole attractors; namely, the possibility to make
transitions between different charge orbits of R, with corresponding change of
the supersymmetry properties of the supported attractor solutions. Furthermore,
a suitable action of PQ transformations can also set I4 to zero, or vice versa

""large"" and ""small"" charge orbits, which we classify in some detail within the

Unfortunately this energy-momentum tensor does not correspond to ideal

coupling effects, likely leading to Landau hydrodynamics. Finally, we perform

CEDAR's separation of these layers. Regardless of the authentication method
used, CEDAR establishes a secure session key, which has the flexibility to be
used for multiple capabilities. We demonstrate how a layered approach to
security sessions can avoid round-trips and latency inherent in network
authentication. The creation of a distinct session management layer allows for
optimizations to improve scalability by way of delegating sessions to other
components in the system. This session delegation creates a chain of trust that
reduces the overhead of establishing secure connections and enables centralized
enforcement of system-wide security policies. Additionally, secure channels
based upon UDP datagrams are often overlooked by existing libraries; we show
how CEDAR's structure accommodates this as well. As an example of the utility

a small timing glitch in May 2003, with ${\Delta f}/f=3.7\times10^{-11}$, and a

this excited state needs experimental verification. Other examples using known

beta (F ~ lambda^(-beta)) and a single dust temperature T_d, and find that the
dust temperature and emissivity index varies over the science demonstration
field as 10< T_rm < 25 K and 1 < beta< 4. The latter values are somewhat higher
than the range of beta often quoted in the literature (1< beta< 2). We estimate
the mean values of these parameters to be T_d=19.0 +/- 2.4 K and beta = 1.4 +/-
0.4. In regions of bright cirrus emission, we find that the dust has similar
temperatures with T_d = 18.0 +/- 2.5 K, and similar values of beta, ranging
from 1.4 +- 0.5 to 1.9+/- 0.5. We show that T_d and beta associated with
diffuse cirrus emission are anti-correlated and can be described by the
relationship: beta(T_d) = NT_d^alpha with [N=116+/-38, alpha=-1.4+/1 0.1]. The
strong correlation found in this analysis is not just limited to high density
clumps of cirrus emission as seen in previous studies, but is also seen in
diffuse cirrus in low density regions. To provide an independent measure of
$T_{\rm d}$ and $\beta$, we obtain the angular power spectrum of the cirrus
emission in the {\it IRAS} and SPIRE maps, which is consistent with a power
spectrum of the form P(k)=P_0(k/k_0)^gamma where gamma = \^a H R2.6+/-m 0.2 for
scales of 50-200' in the SPIRE maps. The cirrus rms fluctuation amplitude at

relics (so far attributed to primary, shock-(re)accelerated electrons) or
central halos. Analysing radio and X-ray data from the literature, we find new
connections between halos and relics, such as a universal linear relation
between their peak radio brightness and the gas column density. Our results
indicate that halos, relics, and halo-relic bridges in a cluster, all arise
from the same, homogeneous cosmic ray (CR) ion (CRI) distribution. We
analytically derive the signature of synchrotron emission from secondary
electrons and positrons (CREs) produced in hadronic CRI collisions, for an
arbitrary magnetic field evolution. In our model, flat spectrum halos (both
giant and minihalos) arise from steady-state magnetic fields, whereas relics
and steep halos reflect recent or irregular magnetic growth. This naturally
explains the properties of halos, relics, and the connections between them,
without invoking particle (re)acceleration in weak shocks or turbulence. We
find CRI energy densities in the range u_p~10^-[12.4,13.3]erg cm^-3, with a
spectral index s_p=-2.20+-0.05, and identify a ~0.1 magnetic energy fraction in
some halos and behind relics, as far as 2Mpc from the cluster's centre. The CRI
homogeneity suggests strong CR diffusion, D(100GeV)>~10^32cm^2s^-1. The strong
magnetisation imposes strict upper limits on >10GeV CRE (re)acceleration in
weak shocks (efficiency <10^-4) and turbulence; indeed, each weak shock
slightly lowers the energy fraction of flat CRs.

heterogeneous nature has hindered the characterization of their general
observational properties. To overcome this challenge, we use statistical tools
to analyze the Chandra X-ray images of Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud
SNRs. We apply two techniques, a power-ratio method (a multipole expansion) and
wavelet-transform analysis, to measure the global and local morphological
properties of the X-ray line and thermal emission in twenty-four SNRs. We find
that Type Ia SNRs have statistically more spherical and mirror symmetric
thermal X-ray emission than core-collapse (CC) SNRs. The ability to type SNRs
based on thermal emission morphology alone enables, for the first time, the
typing of SNRs with weak X-ray lines or with low-resolution spectra. We
identify one source, SNR G344.7-0.1, as originating from a CC explosion that
was previously unknown, and we confirm the tentative Type Ia classifications of
G337.2-0.7 and G272.2-3.2. Although the global morphology is indicative of the
explosion type, the relative morphology of the X-ray line emission within SNRs
is not: all sources in our sample have well-mixed ejecta, irrespective of
stellar origin. In particular, we find that 90% of the bright metal-line
emitting substructures are spatially coincident and have similar scales, even
if the metals arise from different burning processes. Moreover, the overall
X-ray line morphologies within each SNR are the same, with <6% differences.
These findings reinforce that hydrodynamical instabilities can efficiently mix
ejecta in Type Ia and CC SNRs. The only exception is W49B, which is likely from
its jet-driven/bipolar SN explosion. Finally, we describe observational
constraints that can be used to test hydrodynamical models of SNR evolution;
notably, the filling factor of X-ray emission decreases with SNR age.

that found along quasar lines of sight. We find a temporal variation in fine

neutral gas show variations too, but this is most likely a random effect caused
by weighting of individual strong absorption lines and which mimics a temporal
variation. Bursts characterized with high or low prompt GRB energy release
produce afterglows with similar absorption line strengths, and likewise for
bursts with bright or faint optical afterglows. Bursts defined as dark from
their optical to X-ray spectral index have stronger absorption lines relative
to the optically bright bursts. The composite spectrum has strong CaII and MgII

M_star and sSFR, following R_MgII \propto M_star^{0.28}\times sSFR^{0.11}. The
strong dependence of R_MgII on M_star is most naturally explained, if more
massive galaxies possess more extended halos of cool gas and the observed MgII
absorbers arise in infalling clouds which will subsequently fuel star formation
in the galaxies. The additional scaling relation of R_MgII with sSFR can be
understood either as accounting for extra gas supplies due to starburst
outflows or as correcting for suppressed cool gas content in high-mass halos.
The latter is motivated by the well-known sSFR--M_star} inverse correlation in
field galaxies. Our analysis shows that a joint study of galaxies and MgII
absorbers along common sightlines provides an empirical characterization of
halo gaseous radius versus halo mass. A comparison study of R_MgII around red-
and blue-sequence galaxies may provide the first empirical constraint for
resolving the physical origin of the observed sSFR--M_star} relation in

experimental study of pure-state transfer by its simulation via mixed-state
chains, and demonstrate protocols for the perfect transfer of quantum
information in these chains. Remarkably, mixed-state chains allow the use of
Hamiltonians which do not preserve the total number of excitations, and which
are more readily obtainable from the naturally occurring magnetic dipolar
interaction. We propose experimental implementations using solid-state nuclear
magnetic resonance and defect centers in diamond.

contributions to RM. This is possible since the latter does not depend on
Galactic latitude. As input data I use RMs from the catalogue by Taylor, Stil,
and Sunstrum, supplemented with published values for the spread in RM
(`sigmaRM') in specific regions on the sky. I test 4 models of the free
electron column density (which I will abbreviate to `DMinf') of the Milky Way,
and the best model builds up DMinf on a characteristic scale of a few kpc from
the Sun. sigmaRM correlates well with DMinf. The measured sigmaRM can be
modelled as a Galactic contribution, consisting of a term sigmaRM,MW that is
amplified at smaller Galactic latitudes as 1/sin|b|, in a similar way to DMinf,
and an extragalactic contribution, sigmaRM,EG, that is independent of latitude.
This model is sensitive to the relative magnitudes of sigmaRM,MW and
sigmaRM,EG, and the best fit is produced by sigmaRM,MW approx. 8 rad/m^2 and
sigmaRM,EG approx. 6 rad/m^2. The 4 published values for sigmaRM as a function
of latitude suggest an even larger sigmaRM,MW contribution and a smaller
sigmaRM,EG. This result from the NVSS RMs and published sigmaRM shows that the
Galactic contribution dominates structure in RM on scales between about 1degr
-- 10degr on the sky. I work out which factors contribute to the variation of
sigmaRM with Galactic latitude, and show that the sigmaRM,EG I derived is an
upper limit. Furthermore, to explain the modelled sigmaRM,MW requires that

sometimes get trapped in long-lived non-Boltzmann quasistationary states (QSS)
which have lifetimes that grow algebraically with the system size. Such states
have been observed in models of globally coupled particles that move under
Hamiltonian dynamics either on a unit circle or on a unit spherical surface.
Here, we address the ubiquity of QSS in long-range systems by considering a
different dynamical setting. Thus, we consider an anisotropic Heisenberg model
consisting of classical Heisenberg spins with mean-field interactions and
evolving under classical spin dynamics. Our analysis of the corresponding
Vlasov equation for time evolution of the phase space distribution shows that
in a certain energy interval, relaxation of a class of initial states occurs
over a timescale which grows algebraically with the system size. We support
these findings by extensive numerical simulations. This work further supports
the generality of occurrence of QSS in long-range systems evolving under
Hamiltonian dynamics.

develop the general linear scalar perturbations of the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe with arbitrary spatial curvature, and
find that an immediate by-product of the setup is that, in all the inflationary
models described by a scalar field, the FRW universe is necessarily flat.
Applying them to the case of the Minkowski background, we find that it is
stable, and, similar to the case $\lambda = 1$, the spin-0 graviton is
eliminated. The vector perturbations vanish identically in the Minkowski
background. Thus, similar to general relativity, a free gravitational field in
this setup is completely described by a spin-2 massless graviton even with
$\lambda \not= 1$. We also study the ghost problem in the FRW background, and
find explicitly the ghost-free conditions. To study the strong coupling
problem, we consider two different kinds of spacetimes all with the presence of
matter, one is cosmological and the one is static. We find that the coupling
becomes strong for a process with energy higher than $M_{pl} |c_{\psi}|^{5/2}$

gravitational field, where $|c_{\psi}| \equiv |(1-\lambda)/(3 \lambda

gravity through observations of quasinormal ringing of black holes. While
General Relativity predicts just two polarizations of gravitational waves, the
so-called plus and cross polarizations, numerous alternative theories of
gravity predict up to six different polarizations which will potentially be
observed in current and future generations of gravitational wave detectors.
Bekenstein's Tensor-Vector-Scalar (TeVeS) theory and its generalization fall
into one such class of theory that predict the full gamut of six polarizations
of gravitational waves. In this paper we begin the study of quasinormal modes
(QNMs) in TeVeS by studying perturbations of the scalar field in a spherically
symmetric background. We show that, at least in the case where superluminal
propagation of perturbations is not present, black holes are generically stable
to this kind of perturbation. We also make a unique prediction that, as the
limit of the various coupling parameters of the theory tend to zero, the QNM
spectrum tends to $1/\sqrt{2}$ times the QNM spectrum induced by scalar
perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole in General Relativity due to the
intrinsic presence of the background vector field. We further show that the QNM
spectrum does not vary significantly from this value for small values of the
theory's coupling parameters, however can vary by as much as a few percent for
larger, but still physically relevant parameters.

process of the price-change in empirical data sets (say, EUR/JPY or USD/JPY

the MRR theory apparently fails to simulate so much as the qualitative
behaviour ('non-monotonic' behaviour) of the response function $R(l)$ ($l$
denotes the difference of times at which the response function is evaluated)
calculated from the data. Especially, we confirm that the stochastic nature of
the Bid-Ask spread causes apparent deviations from a linear relationship
between the $R(l)$ and the auto-correlation function $C(l)$, namely, $R(l)
\propto -C(l)$. To make the microscopic model of double-auction markets having
stochastic Bid-Ask spread, we use the minority game with a finite market
history length and find numerically that appropriate extension of the game
shows quite similar behaviour of the response function to the empirical
evidence. We also reveal that the minority game modeling with the adaptive

'$\lambda$-shapes') more effectively than the fixed (`quenched') look-up table

the anomaly at the Curie temperature. Therefore, the tricritical point (TCP)
where the paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition changes from a second order
to a first order transition is located in the p-T phase diagram. Moreover, the
evolution of the TCP can be followed under the magnetic field in the same way.
It is the first report of the boundary of the first order plane which appears
in the p-T-H phase diagram of weak itinerant ferromagnets. This line of
critical points starts from the TCP and will terminate at a quantum critical
point. These measurements provide the first estimation of the location of the
quantum critical point in the p-H plane and will inspire similar studies of the
other weak itinerant ferromagnets.

require revisiting the assumption that the chromospheric footpoints of solar
flares are areas where accelerated particles only lose energy due to
collisions. Traditionally electrons are thought to be accelerated in the
coronal part of the loop, then travel to the footpoints where they lose their
energy and radiate the observed Hard X-ray. Increasing observational evidence
challenges this assumption. We review the evidence against this assumption and
present the new Local Re-acceleration Thick Target Model (LRTTM) where at the
footpoints electrons receive a boost of re-acceleration in addition to the
usual collisional loses. Such model may offer an alternative to the 'standard'
collisional thick target injection model (TTM) (Brown 1971) of solar HXR burst
sources, requiring far fewer electrons and solving some recent problems with
the TTM interpretation. We look at the different scenarios which could lead to
such re-acceleration and present numerical results from one of them.

using pore-scale network modeling. Non-Newtonian fluids show very complex time
and strain dependent behavior and may have initial yield stress. Their common
feature is that they do not obey the simple Newtonian relation of
proportionality between stress and rate of deformation. They are generally
classified into three main categories: time-independent, time-dependent and
viscoelastic. Two three-dimensional networks representing a sand pack and Berea
sandstone were used. An iterative numerical technique is used to solve the
pressure field and obtain the flow rate and apparent viscosity. The
time-independent category is investigated using two fluid models: Ellis and
Herschel-Bulkley. The analysis confirmed the reliability of the non-Newtonian
network model used in this study. Good results are obtained, especially for the
Ellis model, when comparing the network model results to experimental data sets
found in the literature. The yield-stress phenomenon is also investigated and
several numerical algorithms were developed and implemented to predict
threshold yield pressure of the network. An extensive literature survey and
investigation were carried out to understand the phenomenon of viscoelasticity
with special attention to the flow in porous media. The extensional flow and
viscosity and converging-diverging geometry were thoroughly examined as the
basis of the peculiar viscoelastic behavior in porous media. The modified
Bautista-Manero model was identified as a promising candidate for modeling the
flow of viscoelastic materials which also show thixotropic attributes. An
algorithm that employs this model was implemented in the non-Newtonian code and
the initial results were analyzed. The time-dependent category was examined and
several problems in modeling and simulating the flow of these fluids were
identified.

for practical quantum computation. Of particular interest is the scheme
proposed by Gottesman and Chuang [Nature \textbf{402}, 390 (1999)], showing
that quantum gates can be implemented by teleporting qubits with the help of
some special entangled states. Therefore, the construction of a quantum
computer can be simply based on some multi-particle entangled states, Bell
state measurements and single-qubit operations. The feasibility of this scheme
relaxes experimental constraints on realizing universal quantum computation.
Using two different methods we demonstrate the smallest non-trivial module in
such a scheme---a teleportation-based quantum entangling gate for two different
photonic qubits. One uses a high-fidelity six-photon interferometer to realize
controlled-NOT gates and the other uses four-photon hyper-entanglement to
realize controlled-Phase gates. The results clearly demonstrate the working

overlapping vertices. The effectiveness of a community detection algorithm is
determined by accuracy in finding the ground-truth communities and ability to
scale with the size of the data. In this work, we provide three contributions.
First, we show that a popular measure of accuracy known as the F1 score, which
is between 0 and 1, with 1 being perfect detection, has an information lower
bound is 0.5. We provide a trivial algorithm that produces communities with an
F1 score of 0.5 for any graph! Somewhat surprisingly, we find that popular
algorithms such as modularity optimization, BigClam and CESNA have F1 scores
less than 0.5 for the popular IMDB graph. To rectify this, as the second
contribution we propose a generative model for community formation, the
sequential community graph, which is motivated by the formation of social
networks. Third, motivated by our generative model, we propose the
leader-follower algorithm (LFA). We prove that it recovers all communities for
sequential community graphs by establishing a structural result that sequential
community graphs are chordal. For a large number of popular social networks, it
recovers communities with a much higher F1 score than other popular algorithms.
For the IMDB graph, it obtains an F1 score of 0.81. We also propose a
modification to the LFA called the fast leader-follower algorithm (FLFA) which
in addition to being highly accurate, is also fast, with a scaling that is
almost linear in the network size.

distribution (SED) of galaxies, both absorbing starlight at UV and optical
wavelengths and converting this energy into thermal emission in the infrared.
The detailed description of these phenomena is of fundamental importance in
order to compare the predictions of theoretical models of galaxy formation and
evolution with the most recent observations in the infrared region. In this
paper we compare the results of GRASIL, a code explicitly solving for the
equation of radiative transfer in a dusty medium, with the predictions of a
variety of IR template libraries. We employ star formation history samples
extracted from the semi-analytical galaxy formation model MORGANA to create
libraries of synthetic SEDs from the near- to the far-infrared. We consider
model predictions at different redshift ranges to explore any possible
influence in the shape and normalization of the SEDs due to the expected
evolution of the galaxy properties. We compute the total absorbed starlight
predicted by GRASIL at optical wavelengths to statistically compare the
synthetic SEDs with the selected IR templates. We show that synthetic SEDs at a
given total infrared luminosity are predicted to be systematically different at
different redshift and for different properties of the underlying model galaxy.
However, we determine spectral regions where the agreement between the results
of radiative transfer and IR templates is good in a statistical sense (i.e. in
terms of the luminosity functions). Moreover, we highlight some potentially
relevant discrepancies between the different approaches, both in the region
dominated by PAH emission and at sub-mm wavelengths. These results determine
potentially critical issues in the infrared luminosity functions as predicted
by semi-analytical models coupled with different IR flux estimators.

are re-examined. The aim is to determine the location and character of its
known variable radio emission. The radio emission consists of a primary
component associated with the binary, and a non-thermal source (NE), $0.8"" to
the NE. This work reveals that NE shows no evidence of variation demonstrating
that the variable emission arises in the primary component. With NE constant,
the radio flux from the primary can now be well determined for the first time,
especially in observations that do not resolve both the primary and NE
components. The variable radio emission from the primary has a period of
6.7+/-0.3 years which is described by a simple model of a non-thermal source
orbiting within the stellar wind envelope of the binary. Such a model implies
the presence of a third, unresolved stellar companion (Star C) orbiting the
6.6-day binary with a period of 6.7 years. The non-thermal emission arises from
either a WCR between Star C and the binary system, or possibly from Star C
directly. Examination of radial velocity observations suggests reflex motion of
the binary due to Star C, for which a mass of 23^+22_-14 solar mass is deduced.
Together with the star associated with NE, this implies that Cyg OB2 #5 is a
quadruple system.

simulations of the wind-wind collision between the enigmatic super-massive star
\etacar and its mysterious companion star are presented which include radiative
driving of the stellar winds, gravity, optically-thin radiative cooling, and
orbital motion. Simulations with static stars with a periastron passage
separation reveal that the preshock companion star's wind speed is sufficiently
reduced that radiative cooling in the postshock gas becomes important,
permitting the runaway growth of non-linear thin shell (NTSI) instabilities
which massively distort the WCR. However, large-scale simulations which include
the orbital motion of the stars, show that orbital motion reduces the impact of
radiative inhibition, and thus increases the acquired preshock velocities. As
such, the postshock gas temperature and cooling time see a commensurate
increase, and sufficient gas pressure is preserved to stabilize the WCR against
catastrophic instability growth. We then compute synthetic X-ray spectra and
lightcurves and find that, compared to previous models, the X-ray spectra agree
much better with {\it XMM-Newton} observations just prior to periastron. The
narrow width of the 2009 X-ray minimum can also be reproduced. However, the
models fail to reproduce the extended X-ray mimimum from previous cycles. We
conclude that the key to explaining the extended X-ray minimum is the rate of
cooling of the companion star's postshock wind. If cooling is rapid then
powerful NTSIs will heavily disrupt the WCR. Radiative inhibition of the
companion star's preshock wind, albeit with a stronger radiation-wind coupling
than explored in this work, could be an effective trigger.

chain in a transverse field, we characterize the non-equilibrium response under
adiabatic and sudden quench processes originating from a pure as well as a
mixed excited initial state, and involving either a regular quantum critical or
a multicritical point. We find that the critical exponents of the ground-state
quantum phase transition can be encoded in the dynamical scaling exponents
despite the finite energy of the initial state. In particular, we identify
conditions on the initial distribution of quasi-particle excitation which
ensure Kibble-Zurek scaling to persist. The emergence of effective thermal
equilibrium behavior following a sudden quench towards criticality is also
investigated, with focus on the long-time dynamics of the quasi-particle
excitation. For a quench to a regular quantum critical point, this observable
is found to behave thermally provided that the system is prepared at
sufficiently high temperature, whereas thermalization fails to occur in
quenches taking the system towards a multi-critical point. We argue that the
observed lack of thermalization originates in this case in the asymmetry of the
impulse region that is also responsible for anomalous multicritical dynamical
scaling.

the system is less sticky. The open mushroom (billiard with a hole) is then

double integrator dynamics to maintain a rigid formation in 1D Euclidean space.
The control signal at a vehicle is allowed to use relative position and
velocity with its two nearest neighbors. Most of the work on this problem,
though extensive, has been limited to homogeneous networks, in which agents
have identical masses and control gains, and symmetric control, in which
information from front and back neighbors are weighted equally. We examine the
effect of heterogeneity and asymmetry on the closed loop stability margin,
which is measured by the real part of the least stable pole of the closed-loop
system. By using a PDE (partial differential equation) approximation in the
limit of large number of vehicles, we show that heterogeneity has little effect
while asymmetry has a significant effect on the stability margin. When control
is symmetric, the stability margin decays to 0 as $O(1/N^2)$, where $N$ is the
number of agents, even when the agents are heterogeneous in their masses and
control gains. In contrast, we show that arbitrarily small amount of asymmetry
in the velocity feedback gains can improve the decay of the stability margin to
$O(1/N)$. Poor design of such asymmetry makes the closed loop unstable for
sufficiently large $N$. With equal amount of asymmetry in both position and
velocity feedback gains, the closed loop is stable for arbitrary $N$ and the
stability margin scaling trend can also be improved to $O(1/N)$, but the
sensitivity to disturbance becomes worse. Effect of asymmetry in position
feedback gains alone and unequal amount of asymmetry in position and velocity
feedback are open problems. Numerical computations are provided to corroborate
the analysis.

6203, 6269, 6283, 6379, 6613, 6660, and 6993. All of these M31 DIB carriers
reside in clouds at radial velocities matching those of interstellar Na I
and/or H I. The relationships between DIB equivalent widths and reddening
(E(B-V)) are consistent with those observed in the local ISM of the Milky Way.
Many of the observed sightlines show DIB strengths (per unit reddening) which
lie at the upper end of the range of Galactic values. DIB strengths per unit
reddening are found (with 68% confidence), to correlate with the interstellar
UV radiation field strength. The strongest DIBs are observed where the
interstellar UV flux is lowest. The mean Spitzer 8/24 micron emission ratio in
our three fields is slightly lower than that measured in the Milky Way, but we
identify no correlation between this ratio and the DIB strengths in M31.
Interstellar oxygen abundances derived from the spectra of three M31 H II
regions in one of the fields indicate that the average metallicity of the ISM
in that region is 12 + log[O/H] = 8.54 +- 0.18, which is approximately equal to

being 0.8-1.2 mag brighter in the near-infrared, while the primary of 2MASS

structure and dynamics of sunspots and active regions. However, because of
complexity of sunspot regions local helioseismology diagnostics require careful
analysis of systematic uncertainties and physical interpretation of the
inversion results. We present new results of comparison of the ring-diagram
analysis and time-distance helioseismology for active region NOAA 9787, for
which a previous comparison showed significant differences in the subsurface
sound-speed structure, and discuss systematic uncertainties of the measurements
and inversions. Our results show that both the ring-diagram and time-distance
techniques give qualitatively similar results, revealing a characteristic
two-layer seismic sound-speed structure consistent with the results for other
active regions. However, a quantitative comparison of the inversion results is
not straightforward. It must take into account differences in the sensitivity,
spatial resolution and the averaging kernels. In particular, because of the
acoustic power suppression, the contribution of the sunspot seismic structure
to the ring-diagram signal can be substantially reduced. We show that taking
into account this effect reduces the difference in the depth of transition
between the negative and positive sound-speed variations inferred by these
methods. Further detailed analysis of the sensitivity, resolution and averaging
properties of the local helioseismology methods is necessary for consolidation
of the inversion results. It seems to be important that both methods indicate
that the seismic structure of sunspots is rather deep and extends to at least
20 Mm below the surface, putting constraints on theoretical models of sunspots.

value of the coupling constant. We find conditions for the engine efficiency to
be higher than the uncoupled model; in particular, we find an upper bound which
is tighter than the Carnot bound. A new domain of parameter values is pointed
out which was not feasible in the interaction-free model. Locally, each spin
seems to effect the flow of heat in a direction opposite to the global
temperature gradient. This seeming contradiction to the second law can be
resolved in terms of local effective temperature of the spins.

encompassing the Galactic plane from longitude $210\arcdeg$ to $250\arcdeg$ has
kinematically well-defined segments of the Local and the Perseus arms, suitable
to study the cosmic-ray densities across the outer Galaxy. We measure no large
gradient with Galactocentric distance of the $\gamma$-ray emissivities per
interstellar H atom over the regions sampled in this study. The gradient
depends, however, on the optical depth correction applied to derive the \HI\
column densities. No significant variations are found in the interstellar
spectra in the outer Galaxy, indicating similar shapes of the cosmic-ray
spectrum up to the Perseus arm for particles with GeV to tens of GeV energies.
The emissivity as a function of Galactocentric radius does not show a large
enhancement in the spiral arms with respect to the interarm region. The
measured emissivity gradient is flatter than expectations based on a cosmic-ray
propagation model using the radial distribution of supernova remnants and
uniform diffusion properties. In this context, observations require a larger
halo size and/or a flatter CR source distribution than usually assumed. The
molecular mass calibrating ratio, $X_{\rm CO} = N({\rm H_{2}})/W_{\rm CO}$, is
found to be $(2.08 \pm 0.11) \times 10^{20} {\rm cm^{-2} (K km s^{-1})^{-1}}$

  speciation, inbreeding and recessive mutations","52 pages","Biology Direct 6 (2011) 62",,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Speciation corresponds to the progressive establishment of
reproductive barriers between groups of individuals derived from an ancestral
stock. Since Darwin did not believe that reproductive barriers could be
selected for, he proposed that most events of speciation would occur through a
process of separation and divergence, and this point of view is still shared by
most evolutionary biologists today. Results: I do, however, contend that, if so
much speciation occurs, the most likely explanation is that there must be
conditions where reproductive barriers can be directly selected for. In other
words, situations where it is advantageous for individuals to reproduce
preferentially within a small group and reduce their breeding with the rest of
the ancestral population. This leads me to propose a model whereby new species
arise not by populations splitting into separate branches, but by small
inbreeding groups ""budding"" from an ancestral stock. This would be driven by
several advantages of inbreeding, and mainly by advantageous recessive
phenotypes, which could only be retained in the context of inbreeding.
Reproductive barriers would thus not arise as secondary consequences of
divergent evolution in populations isolated from one another, but under the
direct selective pressure of ancestral stocks. Many documented cases of
speciation in natural populations appear to fit the model proposed, with more
speciation occurring in populations with high inbreeding coefficients, and many
recessive characters identified as central to the phenomenon of speciation,
with these recessive mutations expected to be surrounded by patterns of limited
genomic diversity. Conclusions: Whilst adaptive evolution would correspond to
gains of function that would, most of the time, be dominant, this type of
speciation by budding would thus be driven by mutations resulting in the
advantageous loss of certain functions since recessive mutations very often
correspond to the inactivation of a gene. A very important further advantage of
inbreeding is that it reduces the accumulation of recessive mutations in
genomes. A consequence of the model proposed is that the existence of species
would correspond to a metastable equilibrium between inbreeding and
outbreeding, with excessive inbreeding promoting speciation, and excessive
outbreeding resulting in irreversible accumulation of recessive mutations that
could ultimately only lead to extinction.

the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey (ALFALFA). At a given value of $M_*$, our
sample consists primarily of galaxies that are more HI-rich than average. We
constructed a series of three control samples for comparison with these HI-rich
galaxies. As expected, HI-rich galaxies differ strongly from galaxies of same
stellar mass that are selected without regard to HI content. The majority of
these differences are attributable to the fact that galaxies with more gas are
bluer and more actively star-forming. In order to identify those galaxy
properties that are causally connected with HI content, we compare results
derived for the HI sample with those derived for galaxies matched in stellar
mass, size and NUV-$r$ colour. The only photometric property that is clearly
attributable to increasing HI content, is the colour gradient of the galaxy.
Galaxies with larger HI fractions have bluer, more actively star-forming outer
disks compared to the inner part of the galaxy. HI-rich galaxies also have
larger $g$-band radii compared to $i$-band radii. Our results are consistent
with the ""inside-out"" picture of disk galaxy formation, which has commonly
served as a basis for semi-analytic models of the formation of disks in the
context of Cold Dark Matter cosmologies. The lack of any intrinsic connection
between HI fraction and galaxy asymmetry suggests that gas is accreted smoothly

theoretically. One point of view of the model is the spin-boson model with a
Lorentz shaped spectral density. An alternative view is a qubit coupled to
harmonic oscillator (HO), which in turn coupled to a Ohmic environment. Two
different methods are applied and compared for this problem. One is a
perturbation method based on a unitary transformation. Since the transformed
hamiltonian is of rotating wave approximation (RWA) form, we call it the
transformed rotating wave approximation (TRWA) method. And the other one is the
numerically exact method of the quasi-adiabatic propagator path-integral
(QUAPI) method. TRWA method can be applied from the first point of view. And
the QUAPI method can applied from both points of views. We find that from the
1st point of view QUAPI only works well for large $\Gamma$. Since the memory
time is too long for the practical evaluation of QUAPI when $\Gamma$ is small.
We call this treatment as QUAPI1. And from the 2nd point of view, QUAPI works
well for small $\Gamma$, since the non-adiabatic effect become more important
as $\Gamma$ increases, one need smaller time-step and more steps to obtain
accurate result which also quickly runs out the computational resources. This
treatment is called QUAPI2. We find that the TRWA method works well for the
whole parameter range of $\Gamma$ and show good agreement with QUAPI1 and
QUAPI2. On the other hand, we find that the decoherence of the qubit can be
reduced with increasing coupling between HO and bath. This result may be

LINERs we have performed a study of HST Halpha imaging of 32 LINERs. The main
conclusion from this analysis is that for the large majority of LINERs (84%) an
unresolved nuclear source has been identified as well as extended emission with
equivalent sizes ranging from few tens till about hundredths of parsecs. Their
morphologies appear not to be homogeneous being basically grouped into three
classes:nuclear outflow candidates (42%), core-halo morphologies (25%) and
nuclear spiral disks (14%). Clumpy structures reminiscent of young stellar
clusters are not a common property on LINERs. The remaining 5 galaxies are too
dusty to allow a clear view of the ionized gas distribution. A size-luminosity
relation has been found between the equivalent radius of the Halpha emission
and the (2-10 keV) X-ray luminosities. Both ionised gas morphologies and the
size-luminosity relation are indistinguishable from those of low luminosity
Seyferts, suggesting the same origin for the NLR of LINERs and Seyferts. Also a
relation between soft X-rays and ionized gas has been suggested for the first
time in LINERs. From multiwavelength data, only 4 out of the 32 LINERs have no
evidences on an AGN nature of theirnuclear sources from multiwavelength data,
but extremely obscured AGNs cannot be discarded out given the Compton thick
signatures of their X-ray emission. For the confirmed AGN LINERs, their Halpha
imaging favour core-halo and outflow morphologies (65% of the cases). Finally,
their calculated Eddington ratios show that our LINER sources radiate at
sub-Eddington regime, with core-halo systems having on average larger Eddington
ratios than outflow candidates.

those that will be available soon at the Tevatron in the lower mass region, and
to extend them for a heavier M_{Z'}. A 5\sigma discovery could be possible up
to M_{Z'}=1.2(0.9) TeV at the LHC(Tevatron), while a 2\sigma exclusion at the
LHC could be possible up to M_{Z'}=1.6 TeV. The new gauge coupling g'_1 can
been probed, at 5\sigma, down to \sim (3 \div 4) \cdot 10^{-2} with electrons
and down to \sim (4 \div 5) \cdot 10^{-2} with muons, both at the LHC and at
the Tevatron, for M_{Z'}=600 GeV.
  The Z' boson in this model exhibits novel signatures at the LHC, as
multi-lepton and multi-jet decays via heavy neutrinos, that allow one to
measure the heavy neutrino masses involved. Lastly, the simultaneous
measurement of both the heavy neutrino mass and decay length (over a large
region of parameter space, the heavy neutrinos are rather long-lived particles)

dependent on interactions with impurities/substrates and localization of Dirac
fermions in realistic devices. We microscopically study these interactions
using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) of exfoliated graphene on a SiO2
substrate in an applied magnetic field. The magnetic field strongly affects the
electronic behavior of the graphene; the states condense into welldefined
Landau levels with a dramatic change in the character of localization. In zero
magnetic field, we detect weakly localized states created by the substrate
induced disorder potential. In strong magnetic field, the two-dimensional
electron gas breaks into a network of interacting quantum dots formed at the
potential hills and valleys of the disorder potential. Our results demonstrate
how graphene properties are perturbed by the disorder potential; a finding that
is essential for both the physics and applications of graphene.

lattice data obtained at several values of the lattice spacing and for a range
of quark masses in combined continuum-chiral fits in order to obtain results in
the continuum limit and at physical quark masses. We implement this procedure
at two lattice spacings, with unitary pion masses in the approximate range
290--420\,MeV (225--420\,MeV for partially quenched pions). We use the masses
of the $\pi$ and $K$ mesons and the $\Omega$ baryon to determine the physical

consistent with the predictions of NLO SU(2) chiral perturbation theory, they

monoclinic MC. This MC phase is different from MA type monoclinic phase
reported in BiFeO3 films grown on low mismatch substrates, such as SrTiO3. This
is confirmed not only by synchrotron x-ray studies but also by piezoresponse
force microscopy measurements. The polarization vectors of the tetragonal-like
phase lie in the (100) plane, not the (110) plane as previously reported. A
phenomenological analysis was proposed to explain the formation of MC Phase.
Such a low symmetry MC phase, with its linkage to MA phase and the multiphase
coexistence open an avenue for large piezoelectric response in BiFeO3 films and
shed light on a complete understanding towards possible polarization rotation
paths and enhanced multiferroicity in BiFeO3 films mediated by epitaxial

high-resolution data significantly reduce observational uncertainties and thus
allow us to derive accurate dark matter distributions in these systems. We here
use the bulk velocity fields when deriving the rotation curves of the galaxies.
Compared to other types of velocity fields, the bulk velocity field minimizes
the effect of small-scale random motions more effectively and traces the
underlying kinematics of a galaxy more properly. The ""Spitzer Infrared Nearby
Galaxies Survey"" (SINGS) 3.6 micron and ancillary optical data are used for
separating the baryons from their total matter content in the galaxies. The
sample dwarf galaxies are found to be dark matter dominated over most radii. We
find discrepancies between the derived dark matter distributions of the
galaxies and those of LCDM simulations, even after corrections for non-circular
motions have been applied. The observed solid body-like rotation curves of the
galaxies rise too slowly to reflect the cusp-like dark matter distribution in
CDM halos. Instead, they are better described by core-like models such as
pseudo-isothermal halo models dominated by a central constant-density core. The
mean value of the logarithmic inner slopes of the mass density profiles is
alpha = -0.29 +- 0.07. They are significantly different from the steep slope of
~ -1.0 inferred from previous dark-matter-only simulations, and are more
consistent with shallower slopes found in recent LCDM simulations of dwarf

protons, electrons, and positrons. During dissipative events these particles
tap a significant portion of the internal and/or kinetic energy of the jet and
convert it into electromagnetic radiation. While leptons - even those with only
mildly relativistic energies - can radiate efficiently, protons need to be
accelerated up to energies exceeding $10^{16-19}$ eV to dissipate radiatively a
significant amount of energy via either trigerring pair cascades or direct
synchrotron emission. Here I review various constraints imposed on the role of
hadronic non-adiabatic cooling processes in shaping the high energy spectra of
blazars. It will be argued that protons, despite being efficiently accelerated
and presumably playing a crucial role in jet dynamics and dissipation of the
jet kinetic energy to the internal energy of electrons and positrons, are more
likely to remain radiatively passive in AGN jets.

Nucleosynthesis (BBN) is typically parameterized in terms of the effective
number of neutrinos N_eff. This quantity, in case of no extra degrees of
freedom, depends upon the chemical potential and the temperature characterizing
the three active neutrino distributions, as well as by their possible
non-thermal features. In the present analysis we determine the upper bounds
that BBN places on N_eff from primordial neutrino--antineutrino asymmetries,
with a careful treatment of the dynamics of neutrino oscillations. We consider
quite a wide range for the total lepton number in the neutrino sector, eta_nu=
eta_{nu_e}+eta_{nu_mu}+eta_{nu_tau} and the initial electron neutrino asymmetry
eta_{nu_e}^in, solving the corresponding kinetic equations which rule the
dynamics of neutrino (antineutrino) distributions in phase space due to
collisions, pair processes and flavor oscillations. New bounds on both the
total lepton number in the neutrino sector and the nu_e -bar{nu}_e asymmetry at
the onset of BBN are obtained fully exploiting the time evolution of neutrino
distributions, as well as the most recent determinations of primordial 2H/H
density ratio and 4He mass fraction. Note that taking the baryon fraction as
measured by WMAP, the 2H/H abundance plays a relevant role in constraining the
allowed regions in the eta_nu -eta_{nu_e}^in plane. These bounds fix the
maximum contribution of neutrinos with primordial asymmetries to N_eff as a
function of the mixing parameter theta_13, and point out the upper bound N_eff
< 3.4. Comparing these results with the forthcoming measurement of N_eff by the
Planck satellite will likely provide insight on the nature of the radiation
content of the universe.

propagation pulse velocity due to pronounced dispersion properties. A number of
interesting applications have been proposed to benefit from such slow-light
propagation. Unfortunately, the inevitable presence of disorder, imperfections,
and a finite Q value may heavily affect the otherwise attractive properties of
CROWs. We show how finite a Q factor limits the maximum attainable group delay
time; the group index is limited by Q, but equally important the feasible
device length is itself also limited by damping resulting from a finite Q.
Adding the additional effects of disorder to this picture, limitations become
even more severe due to destructive interference phenomena, eventually in the
form of Anderson localization. Simple analytical considerations demonstrate
that the maximum attainable delay time in CROWs is limited by the intrinsic
photon lifetime of a single resonator.
