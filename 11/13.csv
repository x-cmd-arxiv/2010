asymptotically approaches zero. Such models define a hierarchy based on the
number of moments and associated quadrature nodes, the first level of which
leads to pressureless gas dynamics. We focus in particular on the four moment

the notion of entropic solution. We study the Riemann problem and provide a
series of entropic solutions in particular cases. This leads to a rigorous link
with the possibility of the system of macroscopic PDEs to allow particle
trajectory crossing (PTC) in the framework of smooth solutions. Generalized

Finally, using a kinetic scheme proposed in the literature without mathematical

speed of the particles. This gives rise to anomalously large number
fluctuations dN ~ $N^{0.72 \pm 0.04}$, which are greater than ordinary number
fluctuations of N^{1/2}. We characterize the waves by calculating the
spatiotemporal power spectrum of the density. The position of observed peaks,
as a function of frequency w and wavevector k, yields a linear dispersion
relationship in the long-time, long-wavelength limit and a wavespeed c = w/k.
Repeating this analysis for systems at different densities and air speeds, we
observe a linear increase in the wavespeed with increasing packing fraction
with no dependence on the airflow. Although air-fluidized rods self-propel
individually or in dilute collections, the parallel and perpendicular
root-mean-square speeds of the rods indicate that they no longer self-propel

out the phase behavior for the existence of waves vs self-propulsion as a

Ensemble inequivalence is shown to rely on a peculiar phenomenon, different

important primitive in quantum information processing. Theoretical description
of such a transmission process often considers only a single photon as the
information carrier and thus fails to accurately describe experimental optical
implementations where any number of photons may enter a detector. It is
important to bridge this big gap between experimental implementations and the
theoretical description. One powerful method that emerges from recent efforts
to achieve this goal is to consider a squash model that conceptually converts
multi-photon states to single-photon states, thereby justifying the equivalence
between theory and experiments. However, up to now, only a limited number of
protocols admit a squash model; furthermore, a no-go theorem has been proven
which appears to rule out the existence of a universal squash model. Here, we
observe that an apparently necessary condition demanded by all existing squash
models to preserve measurement statistics is too stringent a requirement for
many protocols. By chopping this requirement, we show that rather surprisingly,
a universal squash model actually exists for a wide range of protocols
including quantum key distribution protocols, quantum state tomography, the
testing of Bell's inequalities, and entanglement verification, despite the

the dynamics involved rewiring shortcuts in every time step of the epidemic
spread. The model of the epidemic is SIR with latency time of 3 time steps. The
behaviour of the epidemic was checked over the range of shortcut probability

for the epidemic spread, for which numerical results were checked against an

Tolerant Control problem. The model is a linear system affected by a
disturbance term: this represents a large class of technological faulty
processes. The goal is to make the system able to tolerate the undesired
perturbation, i.e., to remove or at least reduce its negative effects; such a
task is performed in three steps: the detection of the fault, its
identification and the consequent process recovery. When the disturbance
function is known to be \emph{quantized} over a finite number of levels, the
detection can be successfully executed by a recursive \emph{decoding}
algorithm, arising from Information and Coding Theory and suitably adapted to
the control framework. This technique is analyzed and tested in a flight
control issue; both theoretical considerations and simulations are reported.

associated with one state, and the transition probabilities between the states
do not depend on the state transition history. Here we analyze the song syntax
in a Bengalese finch. We show that the Markov model fails to capture the
statistical properties of the syllable sequences. Instead, a state transition
model that accurately describes the statistics of the syllable sequences
includes adaptation of the self-transition probabilities when states are
repeatedly revisited, and allows associations of more than one state to the
same syllable. Such a model does not increase the model complexity
significantly. Mathematically, the model is a partially observable Markov model
with adaptation (POMMA). The success of the POMMA supports the branching chain
network hypothesis of how syntax is controlled within the premotor song nucleus
HVC, and suggests that adaptation and many-to-one mapping from neural
substrates to syllables are important features of the neural control of complex
song syntax.

massive stars. We explore the stability of such disks against runaway and
non-axisymmetric instabilities using three-dimensional hydrodynamics
simulations in full general relativity using the THOR code. We model the disk
matter using the ideal fluid approximation with a $\Gamma$-law equation of
state with $\Gamma=4/3$. We explore three disk models around non-rotating black
holes with disk-to-black hole mass ratios of 0.24, 0.17 and 0.11. Due to metric
blending in our initial data, all of our initial models contain an initial
axisymmetric perturbation which induces radial disk oscillations. Despite these
oscillations, our models do not develop the runaway instability during the
first several orbital periods. Instead, all of the models develop unstable
non-axisymmetric modes on a dynamical timescale. We observe two distinct types
of instabilities: the Papaloizou-Pringle and the so-called intermediate type
instabilities. The development of the non-axisymmetric mode with azimuthal
number m = 1 is accompanied by an outspiraling motion of the black hole, which
significantly amplifies the growth rate of the m = 1 mode in some cases.
Overall, our simulations show that the properties of the unstable
non-axisymmetric modes in our disk models are qualitatively similar to those in
Newtonian theory.

for masses below 100 GeV will have a substantially enhanced branching ratio
into tau pairs. For this region of parameter space, traditional production
mechanisms (Higgs-strahlung, W fusion and gluon fusion) are suppressed, but it

has a mass of approximately 110 GeV for virtually all of parameter space, with
Standard Model couplings, and thus an increase of a few GeV in the current

showing that it includes well-known BCGs which lie in the SDSS footprint. We
characterize the BCGs in terms of r-band luminosities and optical colours as
well as their trends with redshift. In particular, we define and study the
fraction of blue BCGs, namely those that are likely to be missed by either
colour-based cluster surveys and catalogues. Richer clusters tend to have
brighter BCGs, however less dominant than in poorer systems. 4-9% of our BCGs
are at least 0.3 mag bluer in the g-r colour than the red-sequence at their
given redshift. Such a fraction decreases to 1-6% for clusters above a richness
of 50, where 3% of the BCGs are 0.5 mag below the red-sequence. A preliminary
morphological study suggests that the increase in the blue fraction at lower
richnesses may have a non-negligible contribution from spiral galaxies. We show
that a colour selection based on the g-r red-sequence or on a cut at colour u-r
>2.2 can lead to missing the majority of such blue BCGs. We also extend the
colour analysis to the UV range by cross-matching our catalogue with publicly
available data from Galex GR4 and GR5. We show a clear correlation between
offset from the optical red-sequence and the amount of UV-excess. Finally, we
cross-matched our catalogue with the ACCEPT cluster sample (Cavagnolo et al.,
2009), and find that blue BCGs tend to be in clusters with low entropy and
short cooling times. That is, the blue light is presumably due to recent star
formation associated to gas feeding by cooling flows. (abridged)

analysis in total is based on ~1.3Ms of clean X-ray XMM-Newton data and 13439
cluster member galaxies with redshifts. Cool cores are among the major
contributors to the scatter in the L-sigma relation. When the
cool-core-corrected X-ray luminosity is used the intrinsic scatter decreases to
0.27 dex. Even after the X-ray luminosity is corrected for the cool core, the
scatter caused by the presence of cool cores dominates for the low-mass
systems. The scatter caused by the non-cool-core clusters does not strongly
depend on the mass range, and becomes dominant in the high-mass regime. The
observed L-sigma relation agrees with the self-similar prediction, matches that
of a simulated sample with AGN feedback disregarding six clusters with <45
cluster members with spectroscopic redshifts, and shows a common trend of
increasing scatter toward the low-mass end, i.e., systems with sigma<500km/s. A
comparison of observations with simulations indicates an AGN-feedback-driven
impact in the low-mass regime. The best fits to the $L-M_{\rm gas}$ relations
for the disturbed clusters and undisturbed clusters in the observational sample
closely match those of the simulated samples with and without AGN feedback,
respectively. This suggests that one main cause of the scatter is AGN activity
providing feedback in different phases, e.g., during a feedback cycle. The
slope and scatter in the observed r500-sigma relation is similar to that of the
simulated sample with AGN feedback except for a small offset but still within
the scatter.

between two input-dependent quantum states by making queries to the input. We
characterize the complexity of this problem by introducing a natural
information-theoretic norm that extends the Schur product operator norm. The
complexity of converting between two systems of states is given by the distance
between them, as measured by this norm.
  In the special case of function evaluation, the norm is closely related to
the general adversary bound, a semi-definite program that lower-bounds the
number of input queries needed by a quantum algorithm to evaluate a function.
We thus obtain that the general adversary bound characterizes the quantum query
complexity of any function whatsoever. This generalizes and simplifies the
proof of the same result in the case of boolean input and output. Also in the
case of function evaluation, we show that our norm satisfies a remarkable
composition property, implying that the quantum query complexity of the
composition of two functions is at most the product of the query complexities
of the functions, up to a constant. Finally, our result implies that discrete

have obtained time series spectroscopic observations, which show clear binary
motion as well as radial velocity variations due to pulsation in the primary
star. By modelling the radial velocities we determine a full orbital solution
of the system, which yields M_A sin^3 i = 1.562 +/- 0.012 M_solar and M_B sin^3
i = 1.461 +/- 0.020 M_solar. An estimate of inclination from photometry yields
a primary mass of 1.6 M_solar. Using this derived mass, and the known pulsation
frequency we can impose a lower limit of 1 Gyr on the age of the system, and
constrain the parameters of the oscillation mode. We show that with further
analysis of the spectra (extracting the atmospheric parameters), tighter
constraints could be imposed on the age, metallicity and the mode parameters.
This work emphasizes the power that a single pulsation frequency can have for
constraining stellar parameters in an eclipsing binary system.

probability theory, state estimation in quantum stochastics, and natural
bundles in differential geometry. After some comments on the nature and
necessity of decoherence in open systems and its absence in closed ones, we
prove sharp, state-independent inequalities reflecting the Heisenberg
principle, the necessity of decoherence and the impossibility of perfect joint
measurement. These bounds are used to judge how far a particular measurement is
removed from the optimal one. We do this for a qubit interacting with the
quantized EM field, continually probed using homodyne detection. We calculate
to which extent this joint measurement is optimal. We then propose a two-step
strategy to determine the (possibly mixed) state of n identically prepared
qubits, and prove that it is asymptotically optimal in a local minimax sense,
using `Quantum Local Asymptotic Normality' for qubits. We propose a physical
implementation of QLAN, based on interaction with the quantized EM field. In
differential geometry, a bundle is called `natural' if diffeomorphisms of the
base lift to automorphisms of the bundle. We slightly extend this notion to
`infinitesimal naturality', requiring only vector fields (infinitesimal
diffeomorphisms) to lift. We classify these bundles. Physical fields that
transform under (infinitesimal) space-time transformations must be described in
terms of (infinitesimally) natural bundles. All spin structures are
infinitesimally natural. Our framework thus encompasses Fermionic fields, for
which the notion of a natural bundle is too restrictive. Interestingly,
generalized spin structures (e.g. spin-c structures) are not always
infinitesimally natural. We classify the ones that are. Depending on the gauge
group at hand, this can significantly reduce the number of allowed space-time
topologies.

lower-mass spheroids exhibit power law 'cusps' with $\Sigma \propto R^(-n)$,
where 0.5<n<1 for radii ~1-100 pc. Observations and theory support models in
which these cusps are formed by dissipative gas inflows and nuclear starbursts
in gas-rich mergers. At these comparatively large radii, stellar relaxation is
unlikely to account for or strongly modify the cuspy stellar profiles. We argue
that the power-law surface density profiles observed are a natural consequence
of the gravitational instabilities that dominate angular momentum transport in
the gravitational potential of a central massive black hole. The dominant mode
at these radii is an m=1 lopsided/eccentric disk instability, in which stars
torquing the gas can drive rapid inflow and accretion. Such a mode first
generically appears at large radii and propagates inwards by exciting
eccentricities at smaller and smaller radii, where M*(<R)<<M_BH. When the
stellar surface density profile is comparatively shallow with n<1/2, the modes
cannot efficiently propagate to R=0 and so gas piles up and star formation
steepens the profile. But if the profile is steeper than n=1, the inwards
propagation of eccentricity is strongly damped, suppressing inflow and bringing
n down again. Together these results produce an equilibrium slope of 1/2 < n <
1 in the potential of the central black hole. These physical arguments are
supported by nonlinear numerical simulations of gas inflow in galactic nuclei.
Together, these results naturally explain the observed stellar density profiles
of 'cusp' elliptical galaxies.

large transition magnetic moment. Such a model was suggested as a possible
resolution to the puzzle presented by the results of the LSND, KARMEN, and
MiniBooNE experiments. We find that the scenario with the radiative decay to
massless neutrinos is ruled out by measurements of the radiative muon capture
rates at TRIUMF in the relevant mass range by a factor of a few in the squared
mixing angle. These constraints are complementary to those imposed by the
process of electromagnetic upscattering and de-excitation of beam neutrinos
inside the neutrino detectors induced by a large transition magnetic moment.
The latter provide stringent constraints on the size of the transitional
magnetic moment between muon, electron neutrinos and $N$. We also show that
further extension of the model with another massive neutrino in the final state
of the radiative decay may be used to bypass the constraints derived in this
work.

and H-ATLAS galaxies within this region can be fitted by a power law, with
correlation length r_0 ~ 4.63 +/- 0.51 Mpc. Comparing with the corresponding
auto-correlation function of GAMA galaxies within the SDP field yields a
relative bias (averaged over 2-8 Mpc) of H-ATLAS and GAMA galaxies of b_H/b_G ~
0.6. Combined with clustering measurements from previous optical studies, this
indicates that most of the low redshift H-ATLAS sources are hosted by halos
with masses comparable to that of the Milky Way. The correlation function
appears to depend on the 250 um luminosity, L_250, with bright (median
luminosity \nu L_250 ~ 1.6 x 10^10 L_sun) objects being somewhat more strongly
clustered than faint (\nu L_250 ~ 4.0 x 10^9 L_sun) objects. This implies that
galaxies with higher dust-obscured star formation rates are hosted by more
massive halos.

follows. Let $H$ be a subgraph of a network $G$ where each vertex of $G$ knows
which edges incident on it are in $H$. We would like to verify whether $H$ has
some properties, e.g., if it is a tree or if it is connected. We would like to
perform this verification in a decentralized fashion via a distributed
algorithm. The time complexity of verification is measured as the number of
rounds of distributed communication. In this paper we initiate a systematic
study of distributed verification, and give almost tight lower bounds on the
running time of distributed verification algorithms for many fundamental
problems such as connectivity, spanning connected subgraph, and $s-t$ cut
verification. We then show applications of these results in deriving strong
unconditional time lower bounds on the {\em hardness of distributed
approximation} for many classical optimization problems including minimum
spanning tree, shortest paths, and minimum cut. Many of these results are the
first non-trivial lower bounds for both exact and approximate distributed
computation and they resolve previous open questions. Moreover, our
unconditional lower bound of approximating minimum spanning tree (MST) subsumes
and improves upon the previous hardness of approximation bound of Elkin [STOC
2004] as well as the lower bound for (exact) MST computation of Peleg and
Rubinovich [FOCS 1999]. Our result implies that there can be no distributed
approximation algorithm for MST that is significantly faster than the current
exact algorithm, for {\em any} approximation factor. Our lower bound proofs
show an interesting connection between communication complexity and distributed
computing which turns out to be useful in establishing the time complexity of
exact and approximate distributed computation of many problems.

turbulence, including simplified treatments of non-equilibrium chemistry and
the propagation of dissociating radiation, to follow the formation of H_2 from
cold atomic gas. The formation time scale for H_2 is sufficiently long that
equilibrium is not reached within the 20-30 Myr lifetimes of molecular clouds.
The equilibrium balance between radiative dissociation and H_2 formation on
dust grains fails to predict the time-dependent molecular fractions we find. A
simple, time-dependent model of H_2 formation can reproduce the gross behavior,
although turbulent density perturbations increase molecular fractions by a
factor of few above it. In contradiction to equilibrium models, radiative
dissociation of molecules plays little role in our model for diffuse radiation
fields with strengths less than ten times that of the solar neighborhood,
because of the effective self-shielding of H_2. The observed correlation of
R_mol with pressure corresponds to a correlation with local gas density if the
effective temperature in the cold neutral medium of galactic disks is roughly
constant. We indeed find such a correlation of R_mol with density. If we
examine the value of R_mol in our local models after a free-fall time at their

large-scale gravitational instability, our models reproduce the observed

long standing questions about macroscopic quantum coherence. The field of
cavity opto- and electro-mechanics, in which a mechanical oscillator is
parametrically coupled to an electromagnetic resonance, provides a practical
architecture for the manipulation and detection of motion at the quantum level.
Reaching this quantum level requires strong coupling, interaction timescales
between the two systems that are faster than the time it takes for energy to be
dissipated. By incorporating a free-standing, flexible aluminum membrane into a
lumped-element superconducting resonant cavity, we have increased the single
photon coupling strength between radio-frequency mechanical motion and resonant
microwave photons by more than two orders of magnitude beyond the current
state-of-the-art. A parametric drive tone at the difference frequency between
the two resonant systems dramatically increases the overall coupling strength.
This has allowed us to completely enter the strong coupling regime. This is
evidenced by a maximum normal mode splitting of nearly six bare cavity
line-widths. Spectroscopic measurements of these 'dressed states' are in
excellent quantitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. The basic
architecture presented here provides a feasible path to ground-state cooling

condensed cores is analyzed in relation to their astrophysical environment. The
cores are modeled as critically stable self-gravitating spheres embedded at the
center of self-gravitating filaments that are assumed to be either spherical or
cylindrical in shape. The filaments are heated by an isotropic interstellar
radiation field (ISRF). The calculations are based on a physical dust model of
stochastically heated grains of diffuse interstellar dust. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) of the cores is calculated using a ray-tracing technique
where the effects of scattered emission and re-heating by dust grains are
accurately taken into account. To compare with observational studies, the dust
re-emission spectrum is approximated by a modified black-body function and the
brightness profile with a Gaussian source. A simplified single-zone model for
cores is presented that incorporates on the basis of the derived emissivities a
first order approximation of their SED. Colder dust temperatures are,
independent of the core mass, related to a higher pressure both inside and
around the filament. The pressure-temperature relation for given external
pressure is found to be largely independent of the true shape of the filament.
The calculations show that the radiative transfer leads to a lower emission
coefficient at 250 micron and to a flatter emissivity law of typically beta<1.8
in the far-infrared sub-millimeter regime. These effects cause the core mass to
be underestimated by more than a factor of 2 based on the typical assumptions
used in observational programs. A larger uncertainty is expected for high
pressure regions.

have recently received considerable attention. In this paper, we show how
different MKL algorithms can be understood as applications of either
regularization on the kernel weights or block-norm-based regularization, which
is more common in structured sparsity and multi-task learning. We show that
these two regularization strategies can be systematically mapped to each other
through a concave conjugate operation. When the kernel-weight-based regularizer
is separable into components, we can naturally consider a generative
probabilistic model behind MKL. Based on this model, we propose learning
algorithms for the kernel weights through the maximization of marginal
likelihood. We show through numerical experiments that $\ell_2$-norm MKL and
Elastic-net MKL achieve comparable accuracy to uniform kernel combination.
Although uniform kernel combination might be preferable from its simplicity,
$\ell_2$-norm MKL and Elastic-net MKL can learn the usefulness of the
information sources represented as kernels. In particular, Elastic-net MKL
achieves sparsity in the kernel weights.

that the early-time GeV emission and the late-time radio, optical, and X-ray

external forward shock caused by structured ejecta propagating in a wind bubble
jumping to a homogeneous density medium. If the ceasing time for majority of

forward shock, the structured ejecta with continuous energy injection to the
forward shock can well explain the early rising feature of the GeV mission from
these burst, and the density-jump medium can account for some certain plateaus

external shock origin of the GeV photons will make the optical depth have not
significant contribution to the early LAT rising part, which will loosen strong
constraint of lower limits of Lorentz factor. On the other hand, these
Fermi-LAT events preferentially occur in a low-density circumburst environment,

provides an unprecedented opportunity to study gamma-ray blazars. To capitalize
on this opportunity, beginning in late 2007, about a year before the start of
LAT science operations, we began a large-scale, fast-cadence 15 GHz radio
monitoring program with the 40-m telescope at the Owens Valley Radio
Observatory (OVRO). This program began with the 1158 northern (declination>-20
deg) sources from the Candidate Gamma-ray Blazar Survey (CGRaBS) and now
encompasses over 1500 sources, each observed twice per week with a ~4 mJy
(minimum) and 3% (typical) uncertainty. Here, we describe this monitoring
program and our methods, and present radio light curves from the first two
years (2008 and 2009). As a first application, we combine these data with a
novel measure of light curve variability amplitude, the intrinsic modulation
index, through a likelihood analysis to examine the variability properties of
subpopulations of our sample. We demonstrate that, with high significance
(7-sigma), gamma-ray-loud blazars detected by the LAT during its first 11
months of operation vary with about a factor of two greater amplitude than do
the gamma-ray-quiet blazars in our sample. We also find a significant (3-sigma)
difference between variability amplitude in BL Lacertae objects and
flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), with the former exhibiting larger
variability amplitudes. Finally, low-redshift (z<1) FSRQs are found to vary
more strongly than high-redshift FSRQs, with 3-sigma significance. These
findings represent an important step toward understanding why some blazars emit
gamma-rays while others, with apparently similar properties, remain silent.

different velocity, mass, and energy. We consider a single inelastic collision
between a faster (inner) and a slower (outer) moving shell. We study the
dynamics of the collision and evaluate the subsequent emission of radiation via
the synchrotron and synchrotron self Compton (SSC) processes after the
interaction between the two shells has begun. The collision results in the
formation of a forward shock (FS) and a reverse shock (RS) that convert the
ordered bulk kinetic energy of the shells into magnetic field energy and
accelerate the particles, which then radiate. We assume a cylindrical geometry
for the emission region of the jet. We treat the self-consistent radiative

control systems over wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs). Thanks to
the use of wireless communications and distributed architectures, these systems
encompass many advantages as compared to traditional networked control systems
using hard wirelines. While WSANs are enabling a new generation of control
systems, they also introduce considerable challenges for quality-of-service
(QoS) provisioning. In this chapter we examine some of the major QoS challenges
raised by WSANs, including resource constraints, platform heterogeneity,
dynamic network topology, and mixed traffic. These challenges make it difficult
to fulfill the requirements of cyber-physical control in terms of reliability
and real-time. The focus of this chapter is on addressing the problem of
network reliability. Specifically, we analyze the behavior of wireless channels
via simulations based on a realistic link-layer model. Packet loss rate (PLR)
is taken as a major metric for the analysis. The results confirm the
unreliability of wireless communications and the uncertainty of packet loss
over WSANs. To tackle packet loss, we present a simple solution that can take
advantage of existing prediction algorithms. Simulations are conducted to
evaluate the performance of several classical prediction algorithms used for
packet loss compensation. The results give some insights into how to deal with
packet loss in cyber-physical control systems over unreliable WSANs.

This particular temperature dependence to conductivities are possible in two
different cases: (1) Background solutions with scale invariant and broken
rotational symmetry, (2) solutions with pseudo-scaling and unbroken rotational
symmetry but only at low density limit. Generically, the study of the transport
properties in a scale invariant background solution, using the probe brane
approach, at high density and at low temperature limit suggests us to consider
only metrics with two exponents. More precisely, the spatial part of the metric
components should not be same i.e., $g_{xx}\neq g_{yy}$. In doing so, we have
generated the above mentioned behavior to conductivity with a very special
behavior to specific heat which at low temperature goes as: $C_V\sim T^3$.
However, if we break the scaling symmetry of the background solution by
including a nontrivial dilaton, axion or both and keep the rotational symmetry
then also we can generate such a behavior to conductivity but only in the low
density regime. As far as we are aware, this particular temperature dependence

possible to define the entropy reduction for arbitrary a priori states (not

in Type Ia supernova remnants that are associated with a low adiabatic index
gamma, where gamma < 5/3, which reflects the expected change in the supernova
shock structure as a result of cosmic-ray particle acceleration. Extreme cases,
such as the case with the maximum compression ratio that corresponds to
gamma=1.1, are examined. As gamma decreases, the shock compression ratio rises,
and an increasingly narrow inter shock region with a more pronounced initial
mixture of R-T unstable gas is produced. Consequently, the remnant outline may
be perturbed by small-amplitude, small-wavelength bumps. However, as the
instability decays over time, the extent of convective mixing in terms of the
ratio of the radius of the R-T fingers to the blast wave does not strongly
depend on the value of gamma for gamma >= 1.2. As a result of the age of the
remnant, the unstable gas cannot extend sufficiently far to form metal-enriched
filaments of ejecta material close to the periphery of Tycho's supernova
remnant. The consistency of the dynamic properties of Tycho's remnant with the
adiabatic model gamma=5/3 reveals that the injection of cosmic rays is too weak
to alter the shock structure. Even with very efficient acceleration of cosmic

deduced from an analysis of scaling properties of the chiral condensate and its

of state in (2+1)-flavor QCD to finer lattice spacings, aT=1/8. We use these
universal scaling properties of the chiral order parameter to extract the
curvature of the transition line at two values of the cut-off, aT=1/4 and 1/8.
We find that cut-off effects are small for the curvature parameter and
determine the transition line in the chiral limit to leading order in the light

fairly well in classical control theory. But for quantum control systems, the
capability of measurement-based feedback control (MFC) has not been
investigated systematically. In contrast to the control of classical systems
where the measurement effect is negligible, the quantum measurement will cause
a quantum state to collapse, which will inevitably introduce additional
uncertainties besides the system initial uncertainty. Therefore, there is a
complicated tradeoff between the uncertainty introduced and the information
gained by the measurement, and thus a theoretical investigation of the
capability of MFC is of fundamental importance. In this paper, inspired by both
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for quantum systems and the investigation
of the feedback capability for classical systems, we try to answer the
following three basic questions: (i) How to choose the measurement channel
appropriately? (ii) Is the MFC still superior to the open loop control in
dealing with the system information uncertainties? and (iii) What is the
maximum capability or limitation of the MFC? These questions will be answered
theoretically by establishing several theorems concerning the asymptotic
reachability of eigenstates of a typical class of Hamiltonian control mode.

Planck-Kolmogorov scales where vorticity is produced, overcoming 10^113 Pa
Planck-Fortov pressures. The spinning, expanding fireball has a slight deficit
of Planck antiparticles. Space and mass-energy powered by gluon viscous
stresses expand exponentially at speeds >10^25 c. Turbulent temperature and
spin fluctuations fossilize at scales larger than ct, where c is light speed

ceases, and because turbulence produces entropy, the universe is closed and
will collapse and rebound. Density and spin fossils of big bang turbulent
mixing trigger structure formation in the plasma epoch. Fragmenting
protosuperclustervoids and protoclustervoids produce weak turbulence until the
plasma-gas transition give chains of protogalaxies with the morphology of
turbulence. Chain galaxy clusters observed at large redshifts ~8.6 support this

9 radio minihalos are known, thus the discovery of a new one, in one of the
most luminous cool-core clusters, provides important information on this
peculiar class of sources and sheds light on their origin. Methods. The diffuse
radio source is detected using GMRT at 327 MHz and confirmed by pointed VLA
data at 1.46 GHz. The minihalo has a radius of $\sim$140 kpc. A Chandra gas
temperature map shows that the minihalo emission fills the cluster cool core
and has some morphological similarities to it, as has been previously observed
for other minihalos. Results. The Chandra data reveal two subtle cold fronts in
the cool core, likely created by sloshing of the core gas, as observed in most
cool-core clusters. Following previous work, we speculate that the origin of
the minihalo is related to sloshing. Sloshing may result in particle
acceleration by generating turbulence and/or amplifying the magnetic field in
the cool core, leading to the formation of a minihalo.

$^{13}$CO(2-1) line observations made with the Submillimeter Array (SMA), we
have identified there a 500 to 1,000 years old, expanding, roughly spherically
symmetric bubble whose characteristics are entirely different from those of
known outflows associated with young stellar objects. The center of the bubble
coincides with the initial position of a now defunct massive multiple stellar
system suspected to have disintegrated 500 years ago, and with the center of
symmetry of the system of molecular fingers surrounding the Kleinmann-Low

be part of the circumstellar material associated with the decayed multiple
system. The Orion hot core, recently proposed to be the result of the impact of
a shock wave onto a massive dense core, is located toward the south-east
