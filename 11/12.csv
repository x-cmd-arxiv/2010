anisotropy, either at the level of a single ion, or in the exchange
interactions between different magnetic ions. Where these exchange interactions
are also frustrated, the competition between them and anisotropy can stabilize
a wide variety of new phases in applied magnetic field. Motivated by the
hexagonal delafossite 2H-AgNiO 2, we study the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a
layered triangular lattice with competing first- and second-neighbour
interactions and single-ion easy-axis anisotropy. Using a combination of
classical Monte Carlo simulation, mean-field analysis, and Landau theory, we
establish the magnetic phase diagram of this model as a function of temperature
and magnetic field for a fixed ratio of exchange interactions, but with values
of easy-axis anisotropy D extending from the Heisenberg (D =0) to the Ising
(D=&#8734) limits. We uncover a rich variety of different magnetic phases.
These include several phases which are magnetic supersolids (in the sense of
Matsuda and Tstuneto or Liu and Fisher), one of which may already have been
observed in AgNiO 2. We explore how this particular supersolid arises through
the closing of a gap in the spin-wave spectrum, and how it competes with rival
collinear phases as the easy-axis anisotropy is increased. The finite
temperature properties of this phase are found to be different from those of
any previously studied magnetic supersolid.

far-UV emission is greatly enhanced above the quiescent photosphere, analogous
to the enhanced X-ray emission of young low-mass stars seen by ROSAT but
detectable to much larger distances with GALEX. By combining GALEX data with
optical (HST Guide Star Catalog) and near-IR (2MASS) photometry, we identified
an initial sample of 34 young M dwarf candidates in a 1000 sq.~deg.~region
around the 10-Myr TW Hydra Association (TWA). Low-resolution spectroscopy of 30
of these found 16 which had H_alpha in emission, which were then followed-up at
high resolution to search for spectroscopic evidence of youth and to measure
radial velocities. Four objects have low surface gravities, photometric
distances and space motions consistent with TWA, but the non-detection of Li
indicates they may be too old to belong to this moving group. One object (M3.5,
93 pc) appears to be the first known accreting low-mass member of the 15~Myr
Lower Centaurus Crux OB association. Two objects exhibit all the
characteristics of the known TWA members, and thus we designate them as TWA 31
(M4.2, 110 pc) and TWA 32 (M6.3, 53 pc). TWA 31 shows extremely broad (447
km/s) H_alpha emission, making it the sixth member of TWA found to have ongoing
accretion. TWA 32 is resolved into a 0.6"" binary in Keck laser guide star
adaptive optics imaging. Our search should be sensitive down to spectral types
of at least M4-M5 in TWA and thus the small numbers of new member is puzzling.
This may indicate TWA has an atypical mass function or that the presence of Li
may be too restrictive a criteria for selecting young low-mass stars.

obtain water and carbon compounds during accretion. Here I examine the
conditions that allow early formation of a surface water ocean (simultaneous
with cooling to clement surface conditions), and the timeline of degassing the
planetary interior into the atmosphere. The greatest fraction of a planet's
initial volatile budget is degassed into the atmosphere during the end of magma
ocean solidification, leaving only a small fraction of the original volatiles
to be released into the atmosphere through later volcanism. Rocky planets that
accrete with water in their bulk mantle have two mechanisms for producing an
early water ocean: First, if they accrete with at least 1 to 3 mass% of water
in their bulk composition, liquid water may be extruded onto the planetary
surface at the end of magma ocean solidification. Second, at initial water
contents as low as 0.01 mass% or lower, during solidification a massive
supercritical fluid and steam atmosphere is produced that collapses into a
water ocean upon cooling. The low water contents required for this process
indicate that rocky super-Earth exoplanets may be expected to commonly produce
water oceans within tens to hundreds of millions of years of their last major
accretionary impact, through collapse of their atmosphere.

(TDCDFT) on a lattice is presented. The density-to-potential mapping and the
${\cal V}$-representability problems are reduced to a solution of a certain
nonlinear lattice Schr\""odinger equation, to which the standard existence and
uniqueness results for nonliner differential equations are applicable. For two
versions of the lattice TDCDFT we prove that any continuous in time current
density is locally ${\cal V}$-representable (both interacting and
noninteracting), provided in the initial state the local kinetic energy is
nonzero everywhere. In most cases of physical interest the ${\cal
V}$-representability should also hold globally in time. These results put the
application of TDCDFT to any lattice model on a firm ground, and open a way for
studying exact properties of exchange correlation potentials.

hyperelliptic Jacobians and their relationship with integrable systems is
motivated by seminal examples of relationship between algebraic two-valued
groups related to elliptic curves and integrable systems such as elliptic
billiards and celebrated Kowalevski top. The present paper is devoted to the
case of genus 2, to the investigation of algebraic two-valued group structures
on Kummer varieties.
  One of our approaches is based on the theory of $\sigma$-functions. It
enables us to study the dependence of parameters of the curves, including
rational limits. Following this line, we are introducing a notion of
$n$-groupoid as natural multivalued analogue of the notion of topological
groupoid.
  Our second approach is geometric. It is based on a geometric approach to
addition laws on hyperelliptic Jacobians and on a recent notion of billiard
algebra. Especially important is connection with integrable billiard systems
within confocal quadrics.
  The third approach is based on the realization of the Kummer variety in the
framework of moduli of semi-stable bundles, after Narasimhan and Ramanan. This
construction of the two-valued structure is remarkably similar to the
historically first example of topological formal two-valued group from 1971,
with a significant difference: the resulting bundles in the 1971 case were
""virtual"", while in the present case the resulting bundles are effectively
realizable.

point with a set of 216 realistic mock galaxy catalogs extracted from MICE7680,
one of the largest volume dark matter simulation run to date, with a volume of
1300 cubical gigaparsecs. Our mocks cover similar volume, densities and bias as
the real galaxies and provide 216 realizations of the Lambda or w=-1 Cold Dark
Matter (wCDM) BAO model. We find that only 20% of the mocks show a
statistically significant (3 sigma) preference for the true (input) wCDM BAO
model as compared to a featureless (non-physical) model without BAO. Thus the
volume of current galaxy samples is not yet large enough to claim that the BAO
feature has been detected. Does this mean that we can not locate the BAO
position? Using a simple (non optimal) algorithm we show that in 50% (100%) of
the mocks we can find the BAO position within 5% (20%) of the true value. These
two findings are not in contradiction: the former is about model selection, the
later is about parameter fitting within a model. We conclude that current
monopole and radial BAO measurements can be used as standard rulers if we
assume wCDM type of models.

dealing with the constrained Hilbert space which follows from the necessity of
Gutzwiller projection.

whether it is eps-away from the set of the separable states in time
exp(O(eps^-2 log |A| log |B|)), where |A| and |B| are the local dimensions, and
the distance is measured with either the Euclidean norm, or with the so-called
LOCC norm. The latter is an operationally motivated norm giving the optimal
probability of distinguishing two bipartite quantum states, each shared by two
parties, using any protocol formed by quantum local operations and classical
communication (LOCC) between the parties. We also obtain improved algorithms
for optimizing over the set of separable states and for computing the
ground-state energy of mean-field Hamiltonians.
  The techniques we develop are also applied to quantum Merlin-Arthur games,
where we show that multiple provers are not more powerful than a single prover
when the verifier is restricted to LOCC protocols, or when the verification
procedure is formed by a measurement of small Euclidean norm. This answers a
question posed by Aaronson et al (Theory of Computing 5, 1, 2009) and provides
two new characterizations of the complexity class QMA, a quantum analog of NP.
Our algorithm uses semidefinite programming to search for a symmetric
extension, as first proposed by Doherty, Parrilo and Spedialieri (Phys. Rev. A,

those of their more massive counterparts. The best method for constraining
these properties, especially masses and radii, is to study eclipsing binary
systems, but only a small number of late-type (M0 or later) systems have been
identified and well-characterized to date. We present the discovery and
characterization of six new M dwarf eclipsing binary systems. The twelve stars
in these eclipsing systems have masses spanning 0.38-0.59 Msun and orbital
periods of 0.6--1.7 days, with typical uncertainties of ~0.3% in mass and
0.5--2.0% in radius. Combined with six known systems with high-precision
measurements, our results reveal an intriguing trend in the low-mass regime.
For stars with M=0.35-0.80 Msun, components in short-period binary systems (P<1
day; 12 stars) have radii which are inflated by up to 10% (mean=4.8+/-1.0%)
with respect to evolutionary models for low-mass main-sequence stars, whereas
components in longer-period systems (>1.5 days; 12 stars) tend to have smaller
radii (mean=1.7+/-0.7%). This trend supports the hypothesis that short-period
systems are inflated by the influence of the close companion, most likely
because they are tidally locked into very high rotation speeds that enhance
activity and inhibit convection. In summary, very close binary systems are not
representative of typical M dwarfs, but our results for longer-period systems
indicate that the evolutionary models are broadly valid in the M~0.35-0.80 Msun
regime.

(LF) and SFR volume density for galaxies at z~0.8. Our analysis is based on
1.18$\mu$m narrowband data from the NEWFIRM H-alpha Survey, a comprehensive
program designed to capture deep samples of intermediate redshift emission-line
galaxies using narrowband imaging in the near-infrared. The combination of
depth ($\approx1.9\times10^{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in H-alpha at
3$\sigma$) and areal coverage (0.82 deg$^2$) complements other recent H-alpha
studies at similar redshifts, and enables us to minimize the impact of cosmic
variance and place robust constraints on the shape of the LF. The present
sample contains 818 NB118 excess objects, 394 of which are selected as H-alpha
emitters. Optical spectroscopy has been obtained for 62% of the NB118 excess
objects. Empirical optical broadband color classification is used to sort the
remainder of the sample. A comparison of the LFs constructed for the four
individual fields reveals significant cosmic variance, emphasizing that
multiple, widely separated observations are required. The dust-corrected LF is
well-described by a Schechter function with L*=10^{43.00\pm0.52} ergs s^{-1},
\phi*=10^{-3.20\pm0.54} Mpc^{-3}, and \alpha=-1.6\pm0.19. We compare our
H-alpha LF and SFR density to those at z<1, and find a rise in the SFR density
\propto(1+z)^{3.4}, which we attribute to significant L* evolution. Our H-alpha
SFR density of 10^{-1.00\pm0.18} M_sun yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3} is consistent with UV
and [O II] measurements at z~1. We discuss how these results compare to other
H-alpha surveys at z~0.8, and find that the different methods used to determine
survey completeness can lead to inconsistent results. This suggests that future
surveys probing fainter luminosities are needed, and more rigorous methods of
estimating the completeness should be adopted as standard procedure.

characterized by pairing that is unconventional and, furthermore, spontaneously
breaks time-reversal symmetry. However, one of the key expected consequences,
viz., that the ground state should exhibit chiral charge currents localized
near the boundaries of the sample, has not been observed, to date. We explore
an alternative implication of time-reversal symmetry breaking: the existence of
walls between domains of opposing chirality. Via a general phenomenological
approach, we derive an effective description of the superconductivity in terms
of the relevant topological variables (i.e., domain walls and vortices). Hence,
by specializing to the in the in-plane rotationally invariant limit, we show
that a domain wall that is translationally invariant along the z axis and
includes a bend through an angle $\Theta$ is accompanied by a nonintegral (and
possibly nonquantized) magnetic {\it bend flux} of
$\big((\Theta/\pi)+n\big)\Phi_0$, with integral $n$, that penetrates the
superconductor, localized near the bend. We generalize this result to the
situation in which gauge transformations and rotations about the z axis are
degenerate transformations of the chiral superconducting order. On the basis of
the specialized result and its generalization, we note that any observation of
localized, nonquantized flux penetrating a z-axis surface (e.g., via
scanned-probe magnetic imaging) can be interpreted in terms of the presence of
bent walls between domains of opposing chirality, and hence is suggestive of
the existence of time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconductivity.

capacity to probe the emission region of a handful of supermassive black holes
on sub-horizon scales. For Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole
at the center of the Milky Way, this provides access to the region in the
immediate vicinity of the horizon. Broderick et al. (2009) have already shown
that by leveraging spectral and polarization information as well as accretion
theory, it is possible to extract accretion-model parameters (including black
hole spin) from mm-VLBI experiments containing only a handful of telescopes.
Here we repeat this analysis with the most recent mm-VLBI data, considering a
class of aligned, radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models. We find
that the combined data set rules out symmetric models for Sgr A*'s flux
distribution at the 3.9-sigma level, strongly favoring length-to-width ratios
of roughly 2.4:1. More importantly, we find that physically motivated accretion
flow models provide a significantly better fit to the mm-VLBI observations than
phenomenological models, at the 2.9-sigma level. This implies that not only is
mm-VLBI presently capable of distinguishing between potential physical models
for Sgr A*'s emission, but further that it is sensitive to the strong
gravitational lensing associated with the propagation of photons near the black
hole. Based upon this analysis we find that the most probable magnitude,
viewing angle, and position angle for the black hole spin are

lensing is a useful tool for constraining the stability of the dark matter. In
the coming decade a number of large, galaxy imaging surveys will be undertaken
and will measure the statistics of cosmological weak lensing with unprecedented
precision. Weak lensing statistics are sensitive to unstable dark matter in at
least two ways. Dark matter decays alter the matter power spectrum and change
the angular diameter distance-redshift relation. We show how measurements of
weak lensing shear correlations may provide the most restrictive,
model-independent constraints on the lifetime of unstable dark matter. Our
results rely on assumptions regarding nonlinear evolution of density
fluctuations in scenarios of unstable dark matter and one of our aims is to
stimulate interest in theoretical work on nonlinear structure growth in
unstable dark matter models.

the rotation curve shape and (2) the logarithmic inner density slope alpha of

feedback processes, such as gas cooling, star formation, cosmic UV background
heating and most importantly physically motivated gas outflows driven by
supernovae (SNe), form bulgeless galaxies with DM cores. We show that the
stellar and baryonic mass is similar to that inferred from photometric and
kinematic methods for galaxies of similar circular velocity. Analyzing the
simulations in exactly the same way as the observational sample allows us to
address directly the so-called ""cusp/core"" problem in the LCDM model. We show
that the rotation curves of the simulated dwarf galaxies rise less steeply than
CDM rotation curves and are consistent with those of the THINGS dwarf galaxies.
The mean value of the logarithmic inner density slopes alpha of the simulated
galaxies' dark matter density profiles is ~ -0.4 +- 0.1, which shows good
agreement with \alpha = -0.29 +- 0.07 of the THINGS dwarf galaxies. The effect
of non-circular motions is not significant enough to affect the results. This
confirms that the baryonic feedback processes included in the simulations are
efficiently able to make the initial cusps with \alpha ~ -1.0 to -1.5 predicted
by dark-matter-only simulations shallower, and induce DM halos with a central
mass distribution similar to that observed in nearby dwarf galaxies.

Blandford-McKee solution to arbitrary ejecta masses and Lorentz factors. Until
recently relativistic supernovae have been discovered only through their
association with long duration Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB). The blastwaves of such
explosions are well described by the Blandford-McKee (in the ultra relativistic
regime) and Sedov-Taylor (in the non-relativistic regime) solutions during
their afterglows, as the ejecta mass is negligible in comparison to the swept
up mass. The recent discovery of the relativistic supernova SN 2009bb, without
a detected GRB, opens up the possibility of highly baryon loaded mildly
relativistic outflows which remains in nearly free expansion phase during the
radio afterglow. In this work, we consider a massive, relativistic shell,
launched by a Central Engine Driven EXplosion (CEDEX), decelerating
adiabatically due to its collision with the pre-explosion circumstellar wind
profile of the progenitor. We compute the synchrotron emission from
relativistic electrons in the shock amplified magnetic field. This models the
radio emission from the circumstellar interaction of a CEDEX. We show that this
model explains the observed radio evolution of the prototypical SN 2009bb and
demonstrate that SN 2009bb had a highly baryon loaded, mildly relativistic
outflow. We discuss the effect of baryon loading on the dynamics and
observational manifestations of a CEDEX. In particular, our predicted angular
size of SN 2009bb is consistent with VLBI upper limits on day 85, but is
presently resolvable on VLBI angular scales, since the relativistic ejecta is

case when one of the values for the loss parameter is zero, i.e., we address
the detection of a possible loss against the alternative hypothesis of an ideal
lossless channel. This discrimination is performed by inputting one-mode or
two-mode squeezed thermal states with fixed total energy. By optimizing over
this class of states, we find that the optimal inputs are pure, thus
corresponding to single- and two-mode squeezed vacuum states. In particular, we
show that for any value of the damping rate smaller than a critical value there
is a threshold on the energy that makes the two-mode squeezed vacuum state more
convenient than the corresponding single-mode state, whereas for damping larger
than this critical value two-mode squeezed vacua are always better. We then
consider the discrimination in realistic conditions, where it is unlikely to
have pure squeezing. Thus by fixing both input energy and squeezing, we show
that two-mode squeezed thermal states are always better than their single- mode
counterpart when all the thermal photons are directed into the dissipative
channel. Besides, this result also holds approximately for unbalanced
distribution of the thermal photons. Finally, we also investigate the role of
correlations in the improvement of detection. For fixed input squeezing
(single-mode or two-mode), we find that the reduction of the quantum Chernoff
bound is a monotone function of the two-mode entanglement as well as the
quantum mutual information and the quantum discord. We thus verify that
employing squeezing in the form of correlations (quantum or classical) is
always a resource for loss detection whenever squeezed thermal states are taken
as input.

Magellanic YSOs, CO ice is not detected in the SMC objects. Both CO and CO2 ice
abundances are enhanced in the LMC when compared to high-luminosity Galactic
YSOs. Based on the fact that both species appear to be enhanced in a consistent
way, this effect is unlikely to be the result of enhanced CO2 production in
hotter YSO envelopes as previously thought. Instead we propose that this
results from a reduced water column density in the envelopes of LMC YSOs, a
direct consequence of both the stronger UV radiation field and the reduced
dust-to-gas ratio at lower metallicity. In the SMC the environmental conditions
are harsher, and we observe a reduction in CO2 column density. Furthermore, the
low gas-phase CO density and higher dust temperature in YSO envelopes in the
SMC seem to inhibit CO freeze-out. The scenario we propose can be tested with
further observations.

  As a consequence, we prove that several competing-provers complexity classes
collapse to PSPACE such as QRG(2), SQG and two new classes called DIP and DQIP.
A special case of our result is a parallel approximation scheme for a specific

Applied to this special case, our algorithm yields a direct polynomial-space

the number of possible patterns grows exponentially with the number of cells,
resulting in practically unlimited complexity. Recent empirical studies,
however, suggest a vast simplification in how multi-neuron spiking occurs: the
activity patterns of some circuits are nearly completely captured by pairwise
interactions among neurons. Why are such pairwise models so successful in some
instances, but insufficient in others? Here, we study the emergence of
higher-order interactions in simple circuits with different architectures and
inputs. We quantify the impact of higher-order interactions by comparing the
responses of mechanistic circuit models vs. ""null"" descriptions in which all
higher-than-pairwise correlations have been accounted for by lower order
statistics, known as pairwise maximum entropy models.
  We find that bimodal input signals produce larger deviations from pairwise
predictions than unimodal inputs for circuits with local and global
connectivity. Moreover, recurrent coupling can accentuate these deviations, if
coupling strengths are neither too weak nor too strong. A circuit model based
on intracellular recordings from ON parasol retinal ganglion cells shows that a
broad range of light signals induce unimodal inputs to spike generators, and
that coupling strengths produce weak effects on higher-order interactions. This
provides a novel explanation for the success of pairwise models in this system.
Overall, our findings identify circuit-level mechanisms that produce and fail
to produce higher-order spiking statistics in neural ensembles.

Our goal is to impose restrictions on the orbital parameters of SFXT. Assuming

Dirac fermion regime, i.e. in whole regime $E_0<t$ where $E_0$ is the distance
between Dirac-point energy and Fermi energy and $t$ is the nearest hopping
energy. For the bipolar ribbon with zigzag edge, however, the incoming electron
flow in n-region is perfectly converged in p-region only in a very low energy
regime with $E_0<0.05t$. Moreover, for a smooth PNJ, electrons are
backscattered near PNJ, which weakens the focusing effect. But the focusing
pattern still remains the same as that of the sharp PNJ. In addition, quantum
oscillation in charge density occurs due to the interference between forward

magnetic field, charge carriers are deflected in opposite directions in the
p-region and n-region. As a result, the focusing effect is smeared. The lower
energy $E_0$, the easier the focusing effect is destroyed. For the high energy

moderate magnetic field on order of one Tesla.

deterioration of physiological function with age and an increase of
vulnerability to disease and death. Living systems, known as complex systems,
require complexity in interactions among molecules, cells, organs, and
individuals or regulatory mechanisms to perform a variety of activities for
survival. On this basis, aging can be understood in terms of a progressive loss
of complexity with age; this suggests that complexity in living systems would
evolve with age. In general, aging dynamics is mathematically depicted by a
survival function, which monotonically changes from 1 to 0 with age. It would
be then useful to find an adequate survival function to link aging dynamics and
complexity evolution. Here we describe a flexible survival function, which is
derived from the stretched exponential function by adopting an age-dependent
exponent. We note that the exponent is associated with evolving complexity,
i.e., a fractal-like scaling in cumulative mortality. The survival function
well depicts a general feature in survival curves; healthy populations show a
tendency to evolve towards rectangular-like survival curves, as examples in
humans or laboratory animals. This tendency suggests that both aging and
complexity would evolve towards healthy survival in living systems. Our
function to link aging with complexity may contribute to better understanding
of biological aging in terms of complexity evolution.

convection and magnetism. Here we study dynamo action realized in the bulk of
the convection zone for a system rotating at three times the current solar
rotation rate. We find that substantial organized global-scale magnetic fields
are achieved by dynamo action in this system. Striking wreaths of magnetism are
built in the midst of the convection zone, coexisting with the turbulent
convection. This is a surprise, for it has been widely believed that such
magnetic structures should be disrupted by magnetic buoyancy or turbulent
pumping. Thus, many solar dynamo theories have suggested that a tachocline of
penetration and shear at the base of the convection zone is a crucial
ingredient for organized dynamo action, whereas these simulations do not
include such tachoclines. We examine how these persistent magnetic wreaths are
maintained by dynamo processes and explore whether a classical mean-field
$\alpha$-effect explains the regeneration of poloidal field.

system cost but also can dramatically reduce the installation space of physical
readers and the operation cost. It is proposed that all equipments in the RFID
network system except RFID tag could be shared with the conventional virtual
technologies. Then, this paper proposes the conditional tag ID processing and
the efficient tag ID transmission method which can greatly reduce the
processing time and processing load in RFID tag Infrastructure network The
conditional tag ID processing allows that tag ID is valid only at a certain
time zone of day or in a certain area. The efficient tag ID transmission method
uses the virtual network address of the service center as a part of the ID of
an RF tag, which allows the direct ID forwarding to the service center.

pseudoeffective. Our techniques build on Shokurov's b-divisors. We define the
notion of nef Weil b-divisors, and of nef envelopes of b-divisors. We relate
the latter to the pull-back of Weil divisors introduced by de Fernex and Hacon.

thin-plate spline, a Bayesian smoothness-prior implementation of penalized
likelihood methods of surface-fitting [Wahba (1990) Spline Models for
Observational Data. SIAM]. The nonlinear component of the surface has only two
parameters, smoothness and anisotropy. The first, a scale parameter, governs
the overall smoothness of the surface, and the second, anisotropy, controls the
relative smoothness over time and over age. For any fixed value of the
anisotropy parameter, the prior is equivalent to a Gaussian process with linear
drift over the time--age plane with easily computed eigenvectors and
eigenvalues that depend only on the configuration of data in the time--age
plane and the anisotropy parameter. This model has application to legal cases

detecting untyped genetic variants that affect disease susceptibility in
genetic association studies. However, existing imputation methods require
individual-level genotype data, whereas, in practice, it is often the case that
only summary data are available. For example, this may occur because, for
reasons of privacy or politics, only summary data are made available to the
research community at large; or because only summary data are collected, as in
DNA pooling experiments. In this article we introduce a new statistical method
that can accurately infer the frequencies of untyped genetic variants in these
settings, and indeed substantially improve frequency estimates at typed
variants in pooling experiments where observations are noisy. Our approach,
which predicts each allele frequency using a linear combination of observed
frequencies, is statistically straightforward, and related to a long history of
the use of linear methods for estimating missing values (e.g., Kriging). The
main statistical novelty is our approach to regularizing the covariance matrix
estimates, and the resulting linear predictors, which is based on methods from
population genetics. We find that, besides being both fast and
flexible---allowing new problems to be tackled that cannot be handled by
existing imputation approaches purpose-built for the genetic context---these
linear methods are also very accurate. Indeed, imputation accuracy using this
approach is similar to that obtained by state-of-the-art imputation methods
that use individual-level data, but at a fraction of the computational cost.

excitation in a collinear four-sublattice (4SL) magnetic ground state of a
triangular lattice antiferromagnet CuFeO2, which has been of recent interest as
a strongly frustrated magnet, a spin-lattice coupled system and a multiferroic.
To avoid mixing of spin-wave spectrum from magnetic domains having three
different orientations reflecting trigonal symmetry of the crystal structure,
we have applied uniaxial pressure on [1-10] direction of a single crystal
CuFeO2. By elastic neutron scattering measurements, we have found that only 10
MPa of the uniaxial pressure results in almost 'single domain' state in the 4SL
phase. We have thus performed inelastic neutron scattering measurements using
the single domain sample, and have identified two distinct spin- wave branches.
The dispersion relation of the upper spin-wave branch cannot be explained by
the previous theoretical model [R. S. Fishman: J. Appl. Phys. 103 (2008)
07B109]. This implies the importance of the lattice degree of freedom in the
spin-wave excitation in this system, because the previous calculation neglected
the effect of the spin-driven lattice distortion in the 4SL phase. We have also
discussed relationship between the present results and the recently discovered
""electromagnon"" excitation.

of disk scale-lengths as a size indicator, we find relations that are
significantly tighter than previously reported: the correlation coefficients of
the template RL and RV relations are r=0.97 and r=0.85, which rival that of the
more widely studied LV (Tully-Fisher) relation. The scatter in the SFI++ RL
relation is 2.5-4 times smaller than previously reported for various samples,
which we attribute to the reliability of isophotal radii relative to disk
scale-lengths. After carefully accounting for all measurement errors, our
scaling relation error budgets are consistent with a constant intrinsic scatter
in the LV and RV relations for velocity widths logW>2.4, with evidence for
increasing intrinsic scatter below this threshold. The scatter in the RL
relation is consistent with constant intrinsic scatter that is biased by
incompleteness at the low-luminosity end. Possible applications of the
unprecedentedly tight SFI++ RV and RL relations are investigated. Just like the
Tully-Fisher relation, the RV relation can be used as a distance indicator: we
derive distances to galaxies with primary Cepheid distances that are accurate
to 25%, and reverse the problem to measure a Hubble constant H_0=72+/-7
km/s/Mpc. Combining the small intrinsic scatter of our RL relation
(0.034+/-0.001 log(kpc/h)) with a simple model for disk galaxy formation, we
find an upper limit on the range of disk spin parameters that is a factor of ~7
smaller than that of the halo spin parameters predicted by cosmological
simulations. This likely implies that the halos hosting Sc galaxies have a much
narrower distribution of spin parameters than previously thought.

the growth rates are finally derived without restricting to spatially
homogeneous cases. All the numerical simulations show a very good agreement

development in flowering plants. Seed in a flowering plant normally contains
diploid embryo and triploid endosperm. Empirical studies have shown that some
economically important endosperm traits are genetically controlled by imprinted
genes. However, the exact number and location of the imprinted genes are
largely unknown due to the lack of efficient statistical mapping methods. Here
we propose a general statistical variance components framework by utilizing the
natural information of sex-specific allelic sharing among sibpairs in line
crosses, to map imprinted quantitative trait loci (iQTL) underlying endosperm
traits. We propose a new variance components partition method considering the
unique characteristic of the triploid endosperm genome, and develop a
restricted maximum likelihood estimation method in an interval scan for
estimating and testing genome-wide iQTL effects. Cytoplasmic maternal effect
which is thought to have primary influences on yield and grain quality is also
considered when testing for genomic imprinting. Extension to multiple iQTL
analysis is proposed. Asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio test for
testing the variance components under irregular conditions are studied. Both
simulation study and real data analysis indicate good performance and
powerfulness of the developed approach.

Along with the imputation process, the costs of underestimating and

penalized more than overestimation in the loss function. We analyze data from

This calls for an inference framework that can handle data that approximate
functions of space, for example, anatomical images, time--frequency maps and
distributed source reconstructions of electromagnetic recordings over time.
Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) is the standard framework for whole-brain
inference in neuroimaging: SPM uses random field theory to furnish $p$-values
that are adjusted to control family-wise error or false discovery rates, when
making topological inferences over large volumes of space. Random field theory
regards data as realizations of a continuous process in one or more dimensions.
This contrasts with classical approaches like the Bonferroni correction, which
consider images as collections of discrete samples with no continuity
properties (i.e., the probabilistic behavior at one point in the image does not
depend on other points). Here, we illustrate how random field theory can be
applied to data that vary as a function of time, space or frequency. We
emphasize how topological inference of this sort is invariant to the geometry
of the manifolds on which data are sampled. This is particularly useful in
electromagnetic studies that often deal with very smooth data on scalp or
cortical meshes. This application illustrates the versatility and simplicity of
random field theory and the seminal contributions of Keith Worsley
(1951--2009), a key architect of topological inference.

edge lithography technologies used for IC making. Simultaneous source mask
optimization (SMO) has become an important objective in the field of
computational lithography. SMO is considered essential to extending immersion
lithography beyond the 45nm node. However, SMO is computationally extremely
challenging and time-consuming. The key challenges are due to run time vs.
accuracy tradeoffs of the imaging models used for the computational
lithography. We present a new technique to be incorporated in the SMO flow.
This new approach is based on the reduced basis method (RBM) applied to the
simulation of light transmission through the lithography masks. It provides a
rigorous approximation to the exact lithographical problem, based on fully
vectorial Maxwell's equations. Using the reduced basis method, the optimization
process is divided into an offline and an online steps. In the offline step, a
RBM model with variable geometrical parameters is built self-adaptively and
using a Finite Element (FEM) based solver. In the online step, the RBM model
can be solved very fast for arbitrary illumination and geometrical parameters,
such as dimensions of OPC features, line widths, etc. This approach
dramatically reduces computational costs of the optimization procedure while
providing accuracy superior to the approaches involving simplified mask models.
RBM furthermore provides rigorous error estimators, which assure the quality
and reliability of the reduced basis solutions. We apply the reduced basis
method to a 3D SMO example. We quantify performance, computational costs and
accuracy of our method.

thermal dust emission. The total (dust + gas) mass of all clouds for which our

Msun in the investigated area; most of this material is in the form of

There is a need for valid and practical ways to assess the protection provided.
This paper develops some simple methods for disclosure limitation techniques

applied in numerical experiments based upon census data from the United Kingdom
which are subject to two perturbation techniques: data swapping (random and
targeted) and the post randomization method. Some simplifying approximations to
the measure of risk are found to work well in capturing the impacts of these
techniques. These approximations provide simple extensions of existing risk
assessment methods based upon Poisson log-linear models. A numerical experiment
is also undertaken to assess the impact of multivariate misclassification with
an increasing number of identifying variables. It is found that the
misclassification dominates the usual monotone increasing relationship between
this number and risk so that the risk eventually declines, implying less
sensitivity of risk to choice of identifying variables. The methods developed
in this paper may also be used to obtain more realistic assessments of risk
which take account of the kinds of measurement and other nonsampling errors
commonly arising in surveys.

of clocking is far more energy-efficient than using spin transfer torque. In
order to assess if such a clocking scheme can be also reasonably fast, we have
studied the magnetization dynamics of a multiferroic logic array with nearest
neighbor dipole coupling using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. We

with proper design provided we clock non-adiabatically and dissipate ~48,000 kT
(at room temperature) of energy per clock cycle per bit flip in the clocking
circuit. This dissipation far exceeds the energy barrier separating the two
logic states, which we assumed to be 32 kT to yield a bit error probability of

energy dissipation would have been much larger (~ $6 \times 106$ kT). This
shows that spin transfer torque, widely used in magnetic random access memory,

customers with i.i.d., generally distributed service times and i.i.d.,

abandon the queue if the time before possible entry into service exceeds the
patience time. The dynamics of the system is represented in terms of a pair of
measure-valued processes, one that keeps track of the waiting times of the
customers in queue and the other that keeps track of the amounts of time each
customer being served has been in service. Under mild assumptions, essentially
only requiring that the service and reneging distributions have densities, as
both the arrival rate and the number of servers go to infinity, a law of large

is shown to be the unique solution of a coupled pair of deterministic integral
equations that admits an explicit representation. In addition, a fluid limit
for the virtual waiting time process is also established. This paper extends
previous work by Kaspi and Ramanan, which analyzed the model in the absence of
reneging. A strong motivation for understanding performance in the presence of
reneging arises from models of call centers.

complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ onto another one $(\hM,\hg)$ of equal
dimension $n\geq 2$. The rolling problem $(NS)$ corresponds to the situation
where there is no relative spin (or twist) of one manifold with respect to the
other one. As for the rolling problem $(R)$, there is no relative spin and also
no relative slip. Since the manifolds are not assumed to be embedded into an
Euclidean space, we provide an intrinsic description of the two constraints
""without spinning"" and ""without slipping"" in terms of the Levi-Civita
connections $\nabla^{g}$ and $\nabla^{\hg}$. For that purpose, we recast the
two rolling problems within the framework of geometric control and associate to
each of them a distribution and a control system. We then investigate the
relationships between the two control systems and we address for both of them
the issue of complete controllability. For the rolling $(NS)$, the reachable
set (from any point) can be described exactly in terms of the holonomy groups
of $(M,g)$ and $(\hM,\hg)$ respectively, and thus we achieve a complete
understanding of the controllability properties of the corresponding control
system. As for the rolling $(R)$, the problem turns out to be more delicate. We
first provide basic global properties for the reachable set and investigate the
associated Lie bracket structure. In particular, we point out the role played
by a curvature tensor defined on the state space, that we call the
\emph{rolling curvature}. In the case where one of the manifolds is a space
form (let say $(\hM,\hg)$), we show that it is enough to roll along loops of
$(M,g)$ and the resulting orbits carry a structure of principal bundle which
preserves the rolling $(R)$ distribution. In the zero curvature case, we deduce
that the rolling $(R)$ is completely controllable if and only if the holonomy
group of $(M,g)$ is equal to SO(n). In the nonzero curvature case, we prove
that the structure group of the principal bundle can be realized as the
holonomy group of a connection on $TM\oplus \R$, that we call the rolling
connection. We also show, in the case of positive (constant) curvature, that if
the rolling connection is reducible, then $(M,g)$ admits, as Riemannian
covering, the unit sphere with the metric induced from the Euclidean metric of
$\R^{n+1}$. When the two manifolds are three-dimensional, we provide a complete
local characterization of the reachable sets when the two manifolds are
three-dimensional and, in particular, we identify necessary and sufficient
conditions for the existence of a non open orbit. Besides the trivial case
where the manifolds $(M,g)$ and $(\hM,\hg)$ are (locally) isometric, we show
that (local) non controllability occurs if and only if $(M,g)$ and $(\hM,\hg)$
are either warped products or contact manifolds with additional restrictions
that we precisely describe. Finally, we extend the two types of rolling to the
case where the manifolds have different dimensions.

Indeed when
inertia is negligible as compared to viscous forces (i.e. Reynolds number $Re$

achieve propulsion at low Reynolds number, swimmers must then deform in a way
that is not invariant under time reversal. Here, we investigate dispersal
properties of self propelled organisms by means of microscopy and cell
tracking. Our system of interest is the micro-alga \textit{Chlamydomonas

diameter that swims with to two front flagella. In the case of dilute
suspensions, we show that tracked trajectories are well modeled by a correlated
random walk. This process is based on short time correlations in the direction
of movement called persistence. At longer times, correlations are lost and a
standard random walk characterizes the trajectories. Moreover, high speed
imaging enables us to show how the back-and-forth motion of flagella at very
short times affects the statistical description of the dynamics. Finally we
show how drag forces modify the characteristics of this particular random walk.

open ionic channels can be predicted by understanding electrodiffusion in fixed

and that this binding is not easily described by the traditional electrostatic
equations of physics textbooks, that describe average electric fields, the
so-called `mean field'. The question is which specific properties can be
explained just by mean field electrostatics and which cannot. I believe the
best way to uncover the specific chemical properties of channels is to invoke
them as little as possible, seeking to explain with mean field electrostatics
first. Then, when phenomena appear that cannot be described that way, by the
mean field alone, we turn to chemically specific explanations, seeking the
appropriate tools (of electrochemistry, Langevin, or molecular dynamics, for
example) to understand them. In this spirit, we turn now to the structure of
open ionic channels, apply the laws of electrodiffusion to them, and see how
many of their properties we can predict just that way.

transfer calculation of the propagation of starlight in galaxy disks. This
model predicts not only the total integrated energy absorbed in the UV/optical

based on an explicit calculation of the strength and colour of the UV/optical
radiation fields heating the dust, and incorporating a full calculation of the
stochastic heating of small dust grains and PAH molecules.
  The geometry of the translucent components of the model is empirically
constrained using the results from the radiation transfer analysis of Xilouris
et al. on spirals in the middle range of the Hubble sequence, while the
geometry of the optically thick components is constrained from physical
considerations with a posteriori checks of the model predictions with
observational data.
  These geometrical constraints enable the dust emission to be predicted in
terms of a minimum set of free parameters: the central face-on dust opacity in
the B-band tau^f_B, a clumpiness factor F for the star-forming regions, the
star-formation rate SFR, the normalised luminosity of the old stellar
population old and the bulge-to-disk ratio B/D. We show that these parameters
are almost orthogonal in their predicted effect on the colours of the dust/PAH
emission.
  The results of the calculations are made available in the form of a large
library of simulated dust emission SEDs spanning the whole parameter space of
our model, together with the corresponding library of dust attenuation
calculated using the same model. (see full abstract in the paper)

functions $P(\delta^{||}_l u|\epsilon_l)$ conditioned on a scale-averaged
energy dissipation rate are close to Gaussian distributions over all scales
within the inertial range of scales. Also transverse increments conditioned on
either the dissipation rate or the square of the vorticity have quasi-Gaussian
probability distribution functions (PDFs). Concerning Lagrangian statistics we
found that conditioning on a trajectory averaged energy-dissipation rate
$\epsilon_\tau$ significantly reduces the scale dependence of the increment
PDFs $P(\delta_\tau u_i|\epsilon_\tau)$. By means of dimensional arguments we
propose a novel condition for Lagrangian increments which is shown to reduce
even more the flatness of the corresponding PDFs and thus intermittency in the
inertial range of scales. The conditioned Lagrangian PDF corresponding to the
smallest increment considered is reasonably well described by the
K41-prediction of the PDF of acceleration. Conditioned structure functions show
approximately K41-scaling with a larger scaling range than the unconditioned

with E(B-V) or H2, confirming earlier results based on smaller datasets. We
show the same is true for six of the seven other DIBs presented here. Despite
this similarity, the eight strong DIBs chosen are not well enough correlated
with each other to suggest they come from the same carrier. We further conclude
that these eight DIBs are more likely to be associated with H than with H2, and
hence are not preferentially located in the densest, most UV shielded parts of
interstellar clouds. We suggest they arise from different molecules found in
diffuse H regions with very little H (molecular fraction f<0.01). Of the 133
stars with available data in our study, there are three with significantly
weaker \lambda 5780.5 than our mean H-5780.5 relationship, all of which are in

is proposed. By defining a statistical mechanical ensemble where only the area

surface of genus $g$ whose area is normalized at $4\pi(g-1)$ has at least
$[\lambda g]$ homologically independent loops of length at most $C_\lambda
\log(g)$. This result extends Gromov's asymptotic $\log(g)$ bound on the
homological systole of genus $g$ surfaces. We construct hyperbolic surfaces
showing that our general result is sharp. We also extend the upper bound
obtained by P. Buser and P. Sarnak on the minimal norm of nonzero period
lattice vectors of Riemann surfaces %systole of Jacobians of Riemann surfaces
in their geometric approach of the Schottky problem to almost $g$ homologically
independent vectors.
  Then, we consider the lengths of pants decompositions on complete Riemannian
surfaces in connexion with Bers' constant and its generalizations. In
particular, we show that a complete noncompact Riemannian surface of genus $g$
with $n$ ends and area normalized to $4\pi (g+\frac{n}{2}-1)$ admits a pants
decomposition whose total length (sum of the lengths) does not exceed $C_g \, n
\log (n+1)$ for some constant $C_g$ depending only on the genus.
  Finally, we obtain a lower bound on the systolic area of finitely presentable
nontrivial groups with no free factor isomorphic to $\Z$ in terms of its first
Betti number. The asymptotic behavior of this lower bound is optimal.

varieties that are defined from quiver representations based on finite eulerian
directed graphs (digraphs). The vanishing first Chern class of these varieties
just follows from the characterisation of eulerian digraphs as being connected
with all vertices balanced. Some structure theory is used to show how any
eulerian digraph can be generated by iterating combinations of just a few
canonical graph-theoretic moves. We describe the effect of each of these moves
on the lattice polytopes which encode the toric Calabi-Yau varieties and
illustrate the construction in several examples. We comment on physical
applications of the construction in the context of moduli spaces for
superconformal gauged linear sigma models.

limit on the mass of a stable or long-lived gluino. Various sources of
uncertainty are examined. The $R$-hadron spectrum and scattering cross sections
are modeled based on known low-energy hadron physics and the resultant
uncertainties are quantified and found to be small compared to uncertainties
from the scale dependence of the NLO pQCD production cross sections. The
largest uncertainty in the limit comes from the unknown squark mass: when the
squark -- gluino mass splitting is small, we obtain a gluino mass limit of 407
GeV, while in the limit of heavy squarks the gluino mass limit is 397 GeV. For
arbitrary (degenerate) squark masses, we obtain a lower limit of 322 GeV on the
gluino mass. These limits apply for any gluino lifetime longer than $\sim 30$
ns, and are the most stringent limits for such a long-lived or stable gluino.
