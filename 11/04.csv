$\eta+V$ with $\eta \in \mathfrak a^*$ and $V \subset \mathfrak a^*$ a subspace
of dimension index $\mathfrak a$ such that restriction of function induces an
isomorphism of $Y(\mathfrak a)$ onto the algebra $R[\eta+V]$ of regular
functions on $\eta+V$. Slices have been obtained in a number of cases through
the construction of an adapted pair $(h,\eta)$ in which $h \in\mathfrak a$ is
ad-semisimple, $\eta$ is a regular element of $\mathfrak a^*$ which is an
eigenvector for $h$ of eigenvalue minus one and $V$ is an $h$ stable complement
to $(\ad \mathfrak a)\eta$ in $\mathfrak a^*$. The classical case is for
$\mathfrak g$ semisimple. Yet rather recently many other cases have been
provided. For example if $\mathfrak g$ is of type $A$ and $\mathfrak a$ is a
""truncated biparabolic"" or a centralizer. In some of these cases (particular
when the biparabolic is a Borel subalgebra) it was found that $\eta$ could be
taken to be the restriction of a regular nilpotent element in $\mathfrak g$.
Moreover this calculation suggested how to construct slices outside type $A$
when no adapted pair exists. This article makes a first step in taking these
ideas further. Specifically let $\mathfrak a$ be a truncated biparabolic of
index one (and then $\mathfrak g$ is of type $A$). In this case it is shown
that the second member of an adapted pair $(h,\eta)$ for $\mathfrak a$ is the
restriction of a particularly carefully chosen regular nilpotent element of
$\mathfrak g$.

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. Examples of these waves are standing
transverse motions, interpreted as the kink MHD modes, and propagating slow
modes, commonly reported at the loop footpoints. Here we study a simple system
in which fast and slow MHD waves are coupled. The goal is to understand the
fingerprints of the coupling when boundary conditions are imposed in the model.
The reflection problem of a fast and slow MHD wave interacting with a rigid
boundary, representing the line-tying effect of the photosphere, is
analytically investigated. Both propagating and standing waves are analysed and
the time-dependent problem of the excitation of these waves is considered. An
obliquely incident fast MHD wave on the photosphere inevitably generates a slow
mode. The frequency of the generated slow mode at the photosphere is exactly
the same as the frequency of the incident fast MHD mode, but its wavelength is
much smaller, assuming that the sound speed is smaller than the Alfv\'en speed.
The main signatures of the generated slow wave are density fluctuations at the
loop footpoints. We have derived a simple formula that relates the velocity
amplitude of the transverse standing mode with the density enhancements at the
footpoints due to the driven slow modes. Using these results it is shown that
there are possible evidences in the observations of the coupling between these
two modes.

investigate the approaches that can be taken by the server to verify the
possibility to reach a state with semantically inconsistent results during the

Often database is used to store the actual data along with the ontologies

important to observe that at the current state of the database the semantic
conflict state may not be reached even if the verification done by the server

grains may be an important feedback mechanism in regulating star-forming
galaxies. We compile data from the literature on star clusters, star-forming
subregions, normal star-forming galaxies, and starbursts to assess the
importance of radiation pressure on dust as a feedback mechanism, by comparing
the luminosity and flux of these systems to their dust Eddington limit. This
exercise motivates a novel interpretation of the Schmidt Law, the LIR-L'CO
correlation, and the LIR-L'HCN correlation. In particular, the linear LIR-L'HCN
correlation is a natural prediction of radiation pressure regulated star
formation. Overall, we find that the Eddington limit sets a hard upper bound to
the luminosity of any star-forming region. Importantly, however, many normal
star-forming galaxies have luminosities significantly below the Eddington
limit. We explore several explanations for this discrepancy, especially the
role of ""intermittency"" in normal spirals - the tendency for only a small
number of subregions within a galaxy to be actively forming stars at any moment
because of the time-dependence of the feedback process and the luminosity
evolution of the stellar population. If radiation pressure regulates star
formation in dense gas, then the gas depletion timescale is 6 Myr, in good
agreement with observations of the densest starbursts. Finally, we highlight
the importance of observational uncertainties - namely, the dust-to-gas ratio
and the CO-H2 and HCN-H2 conversion factors - that must be understood before a
definitive assessment of radiation pressure as a feedback mechanism in
star-forming galaxies.

increases beyond the current level (6-7%) along with significant improvements

morphology of distributed bulk heterojunctions, which plays the central role in
the conversion of photo-generated excitons to electron-hole pairs. However, the
fabrication conditions that can produce the optimal morphology are still
unknown due to the lack of quantitative understanding of the effects of process
variables on the cell morphology. In this article, we develop a unique
process-device co-simulation framework based on phase-field model for phase
separation coupled with self-consistent drift-diffusion transport to
quantitatively explore the effects of the process conditions (e.g., annealing
temperature, mixing ratio, anneal duration) on the organic solar cell
performance. Our results explain experimentally observed trends of open circuit
voltage and short circuit current that would otherwise be deemed anomalous from
the perspective of conventional solar cells. In addition to providing an

approach is ideally suited for a wide class of problems involving porous

their stronger attraction. Nanotube chiralities possessing such collective

the driving of strong horizontal outflows in the penumbra (Evershed effect).
The bulk of energy and mass is transported on scales smaller than the radial
extent of the penumbra. Strong horizontal outflows in the sunspot penumbra
result from a redistribution of kinetic energy preferring flows along the
filaments. This redistribution is facilitated primarily through the Lorentz
force, while horizontal pressure gradients play only a minor role. The Evershed
flow is strongly magnetized: While we see a strong reduction of the vertical
field, the horizontal field component is enhanced within filaments.

been an open issue since the launch of the Swift satellite. One of the
appealing models is the late internal dissipation model, where X-ray emission
during the shallow-decay phase is attributed to internal dissipation, analogous
to the prompt gamma-ray emission. We discuss possible scenarios of the late
prompt emission, such as late internal shocks, magnetic reconnection, and
photospheric dissipation. We also consider the consequences of late dissipation
and a two-component (early and late) jet model for the high-energy (GeV-TeV)
emission. We study not only synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from the
early and late jets but also external inverse-Compton (EIC) emission, which is
naturally predicted in the late dissipation model. For the latter, we perform
numerical calculations taking into account the equal-arrival-time surface of
EIC photons and show that the EIC component typically has a peak at ~1-100 GeV
which may dominate over the SSC components. We demonstrate that very high
energy gamma rays from both these components are detectable for nearby and/or
energetic gamma-ray bursts, with current and future Cherenkov detectors such as
MAGIC, VERITAS, CTA and HAWC, and possibly Fermi. Although the expected event
rate would not be large, detections should be useful as a test of the model.
Multi-wavelength observations using both the ground-based telescopes and the

species (up to Fe) are a means to indirectly access the source spectrum of
cosmic rays. We check the compatibility of the primary fluxes with the
transport parameters derived from the B/C analysis, but also if they bring
further constraints. Proton data are well described in the simplest model
defined by a power-law source spectrum and plain diffusion. They can also be
accommodated by models with, e.g., convection and/or reacceleration. There is
no need for breaks in the source spectral indices below $\sim 1$ TeV/n. Fits on
the primary fluxes alone do not provide physical constraints on the transport
parameters. If we let free the source spectrum $dQ/dE = q \beta^{\eta_S} {\cal

low-energy shape $\eta_T$ of the diffusion coefficient: we find
$\eta_S-\eta_T\approx 0$ for p and He data, but $\eta_S-\eta_T\approx 1$ for C
to Fe primary species. This is consistent with the toy-model calculation in
which the shape of the p/He and C/O to Fe/O data is reproduced if
$\eta_S-\eta_T\approx 0-1$ (no need for different slopes $\alpha$). When
plotted as a function of the kinetic energy per nucleon, the low-energy p/He
ratio is shaped mostly by the modulation effect, whereas primary/O ratios are
mostly shaped by their destruction rate.

degree region, to understand the evolution of dwarf (~M*+2<M_z<M*+4) galaxies

red dwarfs are mostly concentrated in the dense cores of the Coma and Abell
1367 clusters, and in the galaxy groups embedded in the filament connecting
them. The post-starburst (k+A) dwarfs however are found in the infall regions
of the Coma and Abell 1367 clusters, and occasionally in galaxy groups embedded
along the filament, suggesting that strong velocity fields prevalent in the
vicinity of deep potential wells may be closely related to the mechanism(s)
leading to the post-starburst phase in dwarf galaxies. Moreover, the blue
colour of some k+A dwarfs in the Coma cluster, found within its virial radius,
suggests that the star formation in these galaxies was quenched very rapidly in
the last 500 Myr. More than 60% of all red dwarf galaxies in the supercluster
have 0-3 ang of H_\delta in absorption, which suggests that a major episode of
star formation occurred in a non-negligible fraction of these galaxies, ending
within the last Gyr, allowing them to move to the red sequence. The
distribution of the blue dwarf galaxies in the Coma supercluster is bimodal in
the EW(H_\alpha)-EW(H_\delta) plane, with one population having very high
emission in H_\alpha, and some emission in H_\delta. A sub-population of blue
dwarfs is coincident with the red dwarfs in the EW(H_\alpha)-EW(H_\delta)
plane, showing absorption in H_\delta and relatively lower emission in
H_\alpha. We suggest that a large fraction of the latter population are the
progenitors of the passive dwarf galaxies that are abundantly found in the
cores of low-redshift rich clusters such as Coma.

z=2.56, using the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. HCO+ emission is a star
formation indicator similar to HCN, tracing dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(H2)
~= 10^5 cm^-3) within star-forming molecular clouds. We derive a
lensing-corrected HCO+(J=4-3) line luminosity of L'(HCO+(4-3)) = (1.6+/-0.3) x
10^9 (mu_L/11)^-1 K km/s pc^2, which corresponds to only 48% of the HCO+(J=1=0)
luminosity, and <~4% of the CO(J=3-2) luminosity. The HCO+ excitation thus is
clearly subthermal in the J=4-3 transition. Modeling of the HCO+ line radiative
transfer suggests that the HCO+ emission emerges from a region with physical
properties comparable to that exhibiting the CO line emission, but 2x higher
gas density. This suggests that both HCO+ and CO lines trace the warm, dense
molecular gas where star formation actively takes place. The HCO+ lines have
only ~2/3 the width of the CO lines, which may suggest that the densest gas is
more spatially concentrated. In contrast to the z=3.91 quasar APM08279+5255,
the dense gas excitation in the Cloverleaf is consistent with being purely
collisional, rather than being enhanced by radiative processes. Thus, the
physical properties of the dense gas component in the Cloverleaf are consistent
with those in the nuclei of nearby starburst galaxies. This suggests that the
conditions in the dense, star-forming gas in active galactic nucleus-starburst
systems at early cosmic times like the Cloverleaf are primarily affected by the
starburst itself, rather than the central active black hole.

abundance of massive galaxy clusters is a sensitive probe of modifications to
gravity on cosmological scales. In this paper, we present results from N-body
simulations of a general class of f(R) models, which self-consistently solve
the non-linear field equation for the enhanced forces. Within this class we
vary the amplitude of the field, which controls the range of the enhanced
gravitational forces, both at the present epoch and as a function of redshift.
Most models in the literature can be mapped onto the parameter space of this
class. Focusing on the abundance of massive dark matter halos, we compare the
simulation results to a simple spherical collapse model. Current constraints
lie in the large-field regime, where the chameleon mechanism is not important.
In this regime, the spherical collapse model works equally well for a wide
range of models and can serve as a model-independent tool for placing
constraints on f(R) gravity from cluster abundance. Using these results, we
show how constraints from the observed local abundance of X-ray clusters on a
specific f(R) model can be mapped onto other members of this general class of
models.

material. Only high-energy spectroscopy therefore, allows examination of the
matter close to the burst itself. Soft X-ray absorption allows an estimate to
be made of the total column density in metals. The detection of the X-ray
afterglow can also be used to place a limit on the total gas column along the
line of sight based on the Compton scattering opacity. Such a limit would
enable, for the first time, the determination of lower limits on the
metallicity in the circumburst environments of GRBs. In this paper, we
determine the limits that can be placed on the total gas column density in the
vicinities of GRBs based on the Compton scattering. We simulate the effects of
Compton scattering on a collimated beam of high energy photons passing through
a shell of high column density material to determine the expected lightcurves,
luminosities, and spectra. We compare these predictions to observations, and
determine what limits can realistically be placed on the total gas column
density. The smearing out of pulses in the lightcurve from Compton scattering
is not likely to be observable, and its absence does not place strong
constraints on the Compton depth for GRBs. However, the distribution of
observed luminosities of bursts allows us to place statistical, model-dependent
limits that are typically <~1e25 cm^{-2} for less luminous bursts, and as low
as ~1e24 cm$^{-2} for the most luminous. Using the shape of the high-energy
broadband spectrum, however, in some favourable cases, limits as low as ~5e24
cm^{-2} can placed on individual bursts, implying metallicity lower limits from
X- and gamma-rays alone from 0 up to 0.01 Z/Zsun. At extremely high redshifts,
this limit would be at least 0.02 Z/Z_sun, enough to discriminate population
III from non-primordial GRBs.

properties. I briefly review some of those puzzles. I then focus on recent
progress in reconstructing the SN Ia delay time distribution (DTD) -- the SN
rate versus time that would follow a hypothetical brief burst of star
formation. A number of measurements of the DTD over the past two years, using
different methods and based on SNe Ia in different environments and redshift
ranges, are converging. At delays 1<t<10 Gyr, these measurements show a similar
1/t power-law shape, with similar normalizations. The DTD peaks at the shortest
delays probed, but there is still some uncertainty regarding its precise shape
in the range 0.1<t<1 Gyr. At face value, this result supports Ron Webbink's
(1984) idea of a double-degenerate progenitor origin for SNe Ia, but the
numbers currently predicted by binary population synthesis models must be
increased by factors of 3-10, at least. Single-degenerate progenitors may still
play a role in producing short-delay SNe Ia, or perhaps all SNe Ia, if there is
something important missing in the current modeling efforts.

on the strength and density of the substrate disorder, we find that there can
be pronounced anisotropy in the transport produced by different dynamical flow
phases. We also find a disorder-induced ""peak effect"" similar to that observed
for superconducting vortex systems, which is marked by a transition from
elastic depinning to a state where the stripe structure fragments or partially
disorders at depinning. Under the sudden application of a driving force, we
observe pronounced metastability effects similar to those found near the
order-disorder transition associated with the peak effect regime for
three-dimensional superconducting vortices. The characteristic transient time
required for the system to reach a steady state diverges in the region where
the flow changes from elastic to disordered. We also find that anisotropy of
the flow persists in the presence of thermal disorder when thermally-induced
particle hopping along the stripes dominates. The thermal effects can wash out
the effects of the quenched disorder, leading to a thermally-induced stripe
state. We map out the dynamical phase diagram for this system, and discuss how

models. Both planets exhibit stronger eclipses at 4.5 than at 3.6 microns,
which is often indicative of an atmospheric temperature inversion. The spectrum
of CoRoT-1 is best reproduced by a 2460K blackbody, due either to a high
altitude layer that strongly absorbs stellar irradiance, or an isothermal
region in the planetary atmosphere. The spectrum of CoRoT-2 is unusual because
the 8 micron contrast is anomalously low. Non-inverted atmospheres could
potentially produce the CoRoT-2 spectrum if the planet exhibits line emission
from CO at 4.5 microns, caused by tidal-induced mass loss. However, the
viability of that hypothesis is questionable because the emitting region cannot
be more than about 30-percent larger than the planet's transit radius, based on
the ingress and egress times at eclipse. An alternative possibility to account
for the spectrum of CoRoT-2 is an additional opacity source that acts strongly
at wavelengths less than 5 microns, heating the upper atmosphere while allowing
the deeper atmosphere seen at 8 microns to remain cooler. We obtain a similar
result as Gillon et al. for the phase of the secondary eclipse of CoRoT-2,
implying an eccentric orbit with e*cos(omega)=-0.0030 +/- 0.0004.

variance of the noise scales linearly with the expectation of the observation.
Like all heteroscedastic models, the noise terms in this Poisson-like model are
\textit{not} independent of the design matrix.
  More specifically, this paper studies the sign consistency of the Lasso under
a sparse Poisson-like model. In addition to studying sufficient conditions for
the sign consistency of the Lasso estimate, this paper also gives necessary
conditions for sign consistency. Both sets of conditions are comparable to
results for the homoscedastic model, showing that when a measure of the signal
to noise ratio is large, the Lasso performs well on both Poisson-like data and
homoscedastic data.
  Simulations reveal that the Lasso performs equally well in terms of model
selection performance on both Poisson-like data and homoscedastic data (with
properly scaled noise variance), across a range of parameterizations. Taken as

symmetry related to the oscillating sidewall, is $Z_2\times O(2)$. Previous
studies in flows with the same symmetries, such as symmetric bluff-body wakes
and periodically forced rectangular cavities, were unable to obtain the
theoretically predicted bifurcation to modulated traveling waves. In the
simpler cylindrical geometry, where the azimuthal direction is physically
periodic, we have found these predicted modulated traveling waves as stable
fully saturated nonlinear solutions for the first time. A careful analysis of
the base states and their linear stability identifies different parameter
regimes where three-dimensional states that are either synchronous with the
forcing or quasiperiodic, corresponding to different symmetry-breaking
processes. These results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions and
previous results in similar flows. These different regimes are separated by
three codimension-two bifurcation points that are yet to be fully analyzed

Koutny in 1995 as a generalization of the Mazurkiewicz trace notion. Comtraces
are congruence classes of step sequences, where the congruence relation is
defined from two relations simultaneity and serializability on events. They
also showed that comtraces correspond to some class of labeled stratified order
structures, but left open the question of what class of labeled stratified
orders represents comtraces. In this work, we proposed a class of labeled
stratified order structures that captures exactly the comtrace notion. Our main
technical contributions are representation theorems showing that comtrace
quotient monoid, combined dependency graph (Kleijn and Koutny 2008) and our
labeled stratified order structure characterization are three different and yet
equivalent ways to represent comtraces. This paper is a revised and expanded
version of L\^e (in Proceedings of PETRI NETS 2010, LNCS 6128, pp. 104-124).

million (the highest resolution simulations to date) we do not find
convergence. Instead, fragmentation occurs for longer cooling timescales as the
resolution is increased. These results suggest that at the very least, the
critical value of the cooling timescale is longer than previously thought.
However, the absence of convergence also raises the question of whether or not
a critical value exists. In light of these results, we caution against using

dynamics of liquid water. In this paper, we suggest that these effects may have
been overestimated due to the use of rigid water models and flexible models in
which the intramolecular interactions were described using simple harmonic
functions. To demonstrate this, we introduce a new simple point charge model
for liquid water, q-TIP4P/F, in which the O--H stretches are described by
Morse-type functions. We have parameterized this model to give the correct
liquid structure, diffusion coefficient, and infra-red absorption frequencies
in quantum (path integral-based) simulations. By comparing classical and
quantum simulations of the liquid, we find that quantum mechanical fluctuations
increase the rates of translational diffusion and orientational relaxation in
our model by a factor of around 1.15. This effect is much smaller than that
observed in all previous simulations of simple empirical water models, which
have found a quantum effect of at least 1.4 regardless of the quantum
simulation method or the water model employed. The small quantum effect in our
model is a result of two competing phenomena. Intermolecular zero point energy
and tunneling effects destabilize the hydrogen bonding network, leading to a
less viscous liquid with a larger diffusion coefficient. However this is offset
by intramolecular zero point motion, which changes the average water monomer
geometry resulting in a larger dipole moment, stronger intermolecular
interactions, and slower diffusion. We end by suggesting, on the basis of
simulations of other potential energy models, that the small quantum effect we
find in the diffusion coefficient is associated with the ability of our model
to produce a single broad O-H stretching band in the infra-red absorption
spectrum.

subcritical mass-to-flux ratio. In the case of protostellar accretion, rapid
magnetic diffusion (through Ohmic dissipation with additional support from
ambipolar diffusion) near the protostar causes dramatic magnetic flux loss. By
doing so, it also allows the formation of a centrifugal disk, thereby avoiding
the magnetic braking catastrophe.

of ad hoc parameters. Earlier studies of the pion fragmentation functions using
the NJL model within this framework showed qualitative agreement with the

strange quark. The corrections to the pion fragmentation functions and
corresponding kaon fragmentation functions are calculated using the elementary
quark to quark-meson fragmentation functions from NJL. The results for the kaon
fragmentation functions exhibit a qualitative agreement with the empirical

shown to be of the same order of magnitude as the unfavored light quark's. The

rotational nuclei with axially-symmetric strong deformation. The intrinsic
structure represented by the potential energy surface (PES) of a given
multi-nucleon system has a certain similarity to that of the corresponding
multi-boson system. Based on this feature, one can derive an appropriate boson
Hamiltonian as already reported. This prescription, however, has a major
difficulty in rotational spectra of strongly deformed nuclei: the bosonic
moment of inertia is significantly smaller than the corresponding nucleonic
one. We present that this difficulty originates in the difference between the
rotational response of a nucleon system and that of the corresponding boson
system, and could arise even if the PESs of the two systems were identical. We
further suggest that the problem can be cured by implementing $\hat{L} \cdot
\hat{L}$ term into the IBM Hamiltonian, with coupling constant derived from the
cranking approach of Skyrme mean-field models. The validity of the method is
confirmed for rare-earth and actinoid nuclei, as their experimental rotational
yrast bands are reproduced nicely.

regions outside the foot points suggest that the molecular gas is heated up by
some additional heating mechanisms possibly including magnetic reconnection. A

explain these characteristic shapes.

$\mathbb{RP}^n$ with the group $PGL(n+1, \mathbb{R})$. We concentrate on an
orbifold that contains a compact codimension $0$ submanifold whose complement
is a union of neighborhoods of ends, diffeomorphic to closed
$(n-1)$-dimensional orbifolds times intervals. A real projective orbifold has a
{\it radial end} if a neighborhood of the end is foliated by projective
geodesics that develop into geodesics ending at a common point. It has a {\it
totally geodesic end} if the end can be completed to have the totally geodesic
boundary. The orbifold is said to be {\it convex} if any path can be homotopied
to a projective geodesic with endpoints fixed.
  A real projective structure sometimes admits deformations to parameters of
real projective structures. We will prove the local homeomorphism between the
deformation space of convex real projective structures on such an orbifold with
radial or totally geodesic ends with various conditions with the $PGL(n+1,
\mathbb{R})$-character space of the fundamental group with corresponding
conditions. We will use a Hessian argument to show that under a small
deformation, a properly (resp. strictly) convex real projective orbifold with
generalized admissible ends will remain properly and properly (resp. strictly)
convex with generalized admissible ends.
  Lastly, we will prove the openness and closedness of the properly (resp.
strictly) convex real projective structures on a class of orbifold with
generalized admissible ends, where we need the theory of Crampon-Marquis and
Cooper, Long and Tillmann on the Margulis lemma for convex real projective
manifolds. The theory here partly generalizes that of Benoist on closed real
projective orbifolds.

However, the complete price differentiation scheme may lead to a high

scheme, and design a polynomial-time algorithm that can compute the optimal
partial differentiation prices. We also consider the incomplete information

previous work. We find that the stability of Neptunian Trojans seems to be
strongly correlated to their initial post-migration orbital elements, with
those objects that survive as Trojans for billions of years displaying
negligible orbital evolution. The great majority of these survivors began the
integrations with small eccentricities (e < 0.2) and small libration amplitudes
(A < 30 - 40{\deg}). The survival rate of ""pre-formed"" Neptunian Trojans (which
in general survived on dynamically cold orbits (e < 0.1, i < 5 - 10{\deg}))
varied between ~5 and 70%. By contrast, the survival rate of ""captured"" Trojans
(on final orbits spread across a larger region of e-i element space) were
markedly lower, ranging between 1 and 10% after 4 Gyr. Taken in concert with
our earlier work, we note that planetary formation scenarios which involve the
slow migration (a few tens of millions of years) of Neptune from an initial
planetary architecture that is both resonant and compact (aN < 18 AU) provide
the most promising fit of those we considered to the observed Trojan
population. In such scenarios, we find that the current day Trojan population
would number ~1% of that which was present at the end of the planet's
migration, with the bulk being sourced from captured, rather than pre-formed
objects. We note, however, that even those scenarios still fail to reproduce
the currently observed portion of the Neptune Trojan population moving on
orbits with e < 0.1 but i > 20{\deg}. Dynamical integrations of the currently
observed Trojans show that five out of the seven are dynamically stable on 4
Gyr timescales, while 2001 QR322, exhibits significant dynamical instability.
The seventh Trojan object, 2008 LC18, has such large orbital uncertainties that
only future studies will be able to determine its stability.

variety of disciplines. The goal of such an analysis is to investigate
alternative causal mechanisms by examining the roles of intermediate variables
that lie in the causal paths between the treatment and outcome variables. In
this paper we first prove that under a particular version of sequential
ignorability assumption, the average causal mediation effect (ACME) is
nonparametrically identified. We compare our identification assumption with
those proposed in the literature. Some practical implications of our
identification result are also discussed. In particular, the popular estimator
based on the linear structural equation model (LSEM) can be interpreted as an
ACME estimator once additional parametric assumptions are made. We show that
these assumptions can easily be relaxed within and outside of the LSEM
framework and propose simple nonparametric estimation strategies. Second, and
perhaps most importantly, we propose a new sensitivity analysis that can be
easily implemented by applied researchers within the LSEM framework. Like the
existing identifying assumptions, the proposed sequential ignorability
assumption may be too strong in many applied settings. Thus, sensitivity
analysis is essential in order to examine the robustness of empirical findings
to the possible existence of an unmeasured confounder. Finally, we apply the
proposed methods to a randomized experiment from political psychology. We also
make easy-to-use software available to implement the proposed methods.

let $P$ be any parameter system of $R$ and let $z\in P$. We consider any
$\phi\in R$ with $\phi\neq 0$.
  In our main theorem we assume several conditions depending on $P$, $z$ and
Newton polyhedrons. By our assumptions the normal fan $\Sigma$ of the Newton
polyhedron $\Gamma_+(P,\phi)$ of $\phi$ over $P$ has simple structure and we
can make a special regular subdivision $\Sigma^*$ of $\Sigma$ called an upward
subdivision, starting from a regular cone with dimension equal to $\dim R$ and
repeating star subdivisions with center in a regular cone of dimension two. Let
$X$ and $\sigma:X\rightarrow\Spec(R)$ denote the toric variety over $\Spec(R)$
and the toric morphism associated with $\Sigma^*$. We consider any closed point
$a\in X$ such that $\sigma(a)$ is the unique closed point of $\Spec(R)$ and the
morphism $\sigma^*: R \rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{X,a}$ of local $k$-algebras
induced by $\sigma$. We show that our numerical invariant of $\sigma^*(\phi)\in
\mathcal{O}_{X,a}$ measuring the badness of the singularity is strictly less
than the same invariant of $\phi\in R$ and the singularity $\phi$ is strictly
improved by $\sigma$.
  We notice that this result opens a way toward the theory of resolution of
singularities in arbitrary characteristic. We add several submain theorems to
make bridges toward it and to show that our assumptions of the main theorem are
not strong.
  By these results we can show that in a mathematical game with two players A
and B related to the resolution of singularities of $\phi$, the player A can
always win the game after finite steps. It follows ""the local uniformization

events, we perform moment tensor inversions. Inversions are initially kept
unconstrained to estimate the most likely mechanism. Numerical tests show that
unconstrained inversion leads to reliable moment tensor solutions because of
the close proximity of numerous stations to the source positions. However,
single forces cannot be accurately determined as they are very sensitive to
uncertainties in the velocity model. Constrained inversions for a crack, a pipe
or an explosion then allow us to accurately determine the structural
orientations of the source mechanisms. Both numerical tests and LP event
inversions emphasise the importance of using stations located as close as
possible to the source. Inversions for both families show mechanisms with a
strong volumetric component. These events are most likely generated by cracks
striking SW-NE for both families and dipping 70\deg SE (Family 1) and 50\deg NW
(Family 2). For Family 1 events, the crack geometry is nearly orthogonal to the
dike-like structure along which events are located, while for Family 2 the
location gave two pipe-like bodies which belong to the same plane as the crack
mechanism. The orientations of the cracks are consistent with local tectonics,
which shows a SW-NE weakness direction. The LP events appear to be a response

increase from $A_\circ \sim 0.3$ to $A_\circ \sim 0.6$ mag.
  The mean maximum superhump amplitudes normalized to the average luminosity of
the disk are: $<A_n>=0.34\pm 0.02$ in low inclination systems and only
$<A_n>=0.17\pm 0.01$ in high inclination systems. This shows that at high
inclinations the superhump lIght source is {\it partly} obscured by the disk
edge and implies that it is located close to the disk surface but extends
sufficiently high above that surface to avoid full obscuration. Superhump
amplitudes in high inclination systems show modulation with beat phase
($\phi_b$), interpreted as being due to azimuth-dependent obscuration effects
in a non-axisymmetric disk. In addition they show modulation with $2\phi_b$
which implies that the orientation of the superhump light source is correlated
with the direction of the stream.
  The dependence of superhump amplitudes on orbital inclination and their
modulation with beat phase eliminate the tidal-resonance model for superhumps.
Instead they support an alternative interpretation of superhumps as being due
to periodically modulated dissipation of the kinetic energy of the stream.
  Superhump amplitudes in permanent superhumpers are $<A>=0.12$, i.e. much
smaller than the maximum amplitudes observed during superoutbursts.

i.e. patches are connected through migrants dispersing bi-directionally without
a preferred direction. However, for natural populations symmetry is often
broken, e.g. for species in the marine environment dispersing through the
transport of pelagic larvae with ocean currents. The few recent studies of
asymmetric dispersal concluded, that asymmetry has a distinct negative impact
on the persistence of metapopulations. Detailed analysis however revealed, that
these previous studies might have been unable to properly disentangle the
effect of symmetry from other potentially confounding properties of dispersal
patterns. We resolve this issue by systematically investigating the symmetry of
dispersal patterns and its impact on metapopulation persistence. Our main
analysis based on a metapopulation model equivalent to previous studies but now
applied on regular dispersal patterns aims to isolate the effect of dispersal
symmetry on metapopulation persistence. Our results suggest, that asymmetry in
itself does not imply negative effects on metapopulation persistence. For this
reason we recommend to investigate it in connection with other properties of
dispersal instead of in isolation.

calculation of the thermal conductivity of complex disordered materials. The
method, which is based on the Chebyshev polynomial expansion of the time
evolution operator and the Lanczos tridiagonalization scheme, efficiently
treats the propagation of phonon wave-packets in real-space and the phonon
diffusion coefficients. The mean free paths and the thermal conductance can be
determined from the diffusion coefficients. These quantities can be extracted
simultaneously for all frequencies, which is another advantage in comparison
with the Green's function based approaches. Additionally, multiple scattering
phenomena can be followed through the time dependence of the diffusion
coefficient deep into the diffusive regime, and the onset of weak or strong
phonon localization could possibly be revealed at low temperatures for thermal
insulators. The accuracy of our computational scheme is demonstrated by
comparing the calculated phonon mean free paths in isotope-disordered carbon
nanotubes with Landauer simulations and analytical results. Then, the
upscalibility of the method is illustrated by exploring the phonon mean free
paths and the thermal conductance features of edge disordered graphene
nanoribbons having widths of $\sim$20 nanometers and lengths as long as a
micrometer, which are beyond the reach of other numerical techniques. It is
shown that, the phonon mean free paths of armchair nanoribbons are smaller than
those of zigzag nanoribbons for the frequency range which dominate the thermal
conductance at low temperatures. This computational strategy is applicable to
higher dimensional systems, as well as to a wide range of materials.

investigate the impact of starspots on radial velocity searches for earth-mass
planets in orbit about M dwarf stars. Since new surveys targeting M dwarfs will
likely be carried out at infrared wavelengths, a comparison between V and Y
band starspot induced jitter is made, indicating a reduction of up to an order
of magnitude when observing in the Y band. The exact reduction in jitter is
dependent on the photosphere to spot contrast ratio, with greater improvements
at smaller contrasts. We extrapolate a model used to describe solar spot
distributions to simulate the spot patterns that we expect to find on M dwarfs.
Under the assumption that M dwarfs are near or fully convective, we randomly
place starspots on the stellar surface, simulating different levels of spot
coverage. Line profiles, distorted by spots are derived and are used to
investigate the starspot induced jitter. By making assumptions about the degree
of spot activity, detection limits for earth-mass planets in habitable zones
are simulated for between 10 and 500 observation epochs. We find that <= 50
epochs are required to detect 1 - 2 MEarth planets (with < 1 per cent false
alarm probability) orbiting slowly rotating 0.1 and 0.2 MSun stars. This
sensitivity decreases when typical rotation velocities and activity levels for
each stellar mass/spectral type are considered. No detections of below 20

  Revisited",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In considering the college admissions problem, almost fifty years ago, Gale
and Shapley came up with a simple abstraction based on preferences of students
and colleges. They introduced the concept of stability and optimality; and
proposed the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm that is proven to lead to a
stable and optimal solution. This algorithm is simple and computationally
efficient. Furthermore, in subsequent studies it is shown that the DA algorithm
is also strategy-proof, which means, when the algorithm is played out as a
mechanism for matching two sides (e.g. colleges and students), the parties
(colleges or students) have no incentives to act other than according to their
true preferences. Yet, in practical college admission systems, the DA algorithm
is often not adopted. Instead, an algorithm known as the Boston Mechanism (BM)
or its variants are widely adopted. In BM, colleges accept students without
deferral (considering other colleges' decisions), which is exactly the opposite
of Gale-Shapley's DA algorithm. To explain and rationalize this reality, we
introduce the notion of reciprocating preference to capture the influence of a
student's interest on a college's decision. This model is inspired by the
actual mechanism used to match students to universities in Hong Kong. The
notion of reciprocating preference defines a class of matching algorithms,
allowing different degrees of reciprocating preferences by the students and
colleges. DA and BM are but two extreme cases (with zero and a hundred percent
reciprocation) of this set. This model extends the notion of stability and
optimality as well. As in Gale-Shapley's original paper, we discuss how the

powers of linear forms. Its Hilbert series depends only on the matroid

includes the parameter dependence analysis of the equilibrium points and their
local stability, which is closely related to the condensate collective
behaviour. We also consider the effects of off-site interactions, and how these
""cross-collisions"" may become relevant for a large number of trapped bosons.
Besides, we have shown analytically, by means of a simple basis transformation
in the single-particle space, that an integrable sub-regime, known as
twin-condensate dynamics, corresponds in the classical phase space to invariant
surfaces isomorphic to the unit sphere. However, the quantum dynamics preserves
the twin-condensate defining characteristics only partially, thus breaking the
invariance of the associated quantum subspace. Moreover, the periodic geometry
of the trapping potential allowed us to investigate the dynamics of finite
angular momentum collective excitations, which can be suppressed by the
emergence of chaos. Finally, using the generalized purity associated to the
su(3) algebra, we were able to quantify the dynamical classicality of a quantum
evolved system, as compared to the corresponding classical trajectory.

developing a simple framework in which to understand the key issues and derive

closely-related models such as kriging and penalized splines are biased, even

the residual: one can reduce bias by fitting a spatial model only when there is
variation in the covariate at a scale smaller than the scale of the unmeasured

affect efficiency and uncertainty estimation when the residuals are independent

consecutive sequences of genes in a genome. The transposition distance, that

another, is, according to numerous studies, a relevant evolutionary distance.
The problem of computing this distance when genomes are represented by
permutations, called the Sorting by Transpositions problem, has been introduced
by Bafna and Pevzner in 1995. It has naturally been the focus of a number of
studies, but the computational complexity of this problem has remained
undetermined for 15 years. In this paper, we answer this long-standing open
question by proving that the Sorting by Transpositions problem is NP-hard. As a
corollary of our result, we also prove that the following problem is NP-hard:
given a permutation pi, is it possible to sort pi using db(pi)/3 permutations,
where db(pi) is the number of breakpoints of pi?

Jim played poker and made weather forecasts. It is curious that his later
research included strategies for repeated play that apply to selecting the best
forecaster. James Hannan was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts on September 14,
1922. He attended St. Jerome's High School and in January 1943 received the
Ph.B. from St. Michael's College in Colchester, Vermont. Jim enlisted in the US
Army Air Force to train and serve as a meteorologist. This took him to army
airbases in China by the close of the war. Following discharge from the army,
Jim studied mathematics at Harvard and graduated with the M.S. in June 1947. To
prepare for doctoral work in statistics at the University of North Carolina
that fall, Jim went to the University of Michigan in the summer of 1947. The
routine admissions' physical revealed a spot on the lung and the possibility of
tuberculosis. This caused Jim to stay at Ann Arbor through the fall of 1947 and
then at a Veterans Administration Hospital in Framingham, Massachusetts to have
his condition followed more closely. He was discharged from the hospital in the
spring and started his study at Chapel Hill in the fall of 1948. There he began
research in compound decision theory under Herbert Robbins. Feeling the need
for teaching experience, Jim left Chapel Hill after two years and short of
thesis to take a three year appointment as an instructor at Catholic University
in Washington, DC. When told that renewal was not coming, Jim felt pressure to
finish his degree.

  We show that bandit problems with delayed feedback that arise in allocation

optimality. This structure gives us the ability to reason about the
relationship of single arm policies to the entangled optimum policy, and
eventually leads to a O(1) approximation for a significantly general class of

overestimating its excitation energy, but correctly describing its IS strength

the Coulomb interaction between the protons and the resulting isospin-symmetry

density, due to translational invariance. The calculated values of E1 and ISD
strength carried by the IS-LED depend on the effective interaction used.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that in N-not-equal-Z nuclei this
distinct mode of IS surface vibration can develop as such or mix strongly with
skin modes and thus influence the pygmy dipole strength as well as the ISD

supernova remnant (SNR), the binary system gamma2 Velorum and the Gum nebula.
We show that the Vela SNR belongs to a subclass of non-Sedov adiabatic remnants
in a cloudy interstellar medium (ISM), the dynamics of which is determined by
the heating and evaporation of ISM clouds. We explain observable
characteristics of the Vela SNR with a SN explosion with energy 1.4 x 10^50
ergs near the step-like boundary of the ISM with low intercloud densities (~
10^{-3} cm^{-3}) and with a volume-averaged density of clouds evaporated by
shock in the north-east (NE) part about four times higher than the one in the
south-west (SW) part. The observed asymmetry between the NE and SW parts of the
Vela SNR could be explained by the presence of a stellar wind bubble (SWB)
blown by the nearest-to-the Earth Wolf-Rayet (WR) star in the gamma2 Velorum
system. We show that the size and kinematics of gamma2 Velorum SWB agree with
predictions of numerical calculations for the evolution of the SWB of M_ini =
35M* star. The low initial mass of the WR star in gamma2 Velorum implies that
the luminosity of the nuclear line of 26Al, produced by gamma2 Velorum, is
below the sensitivity of existing gamma-ray telescopes.

Bolometer arrays can fulfill these requirements over a very broad band. We
describe a technique that enables bolometer arrays that use quarter wave
cavities to have a high spectral response over most of the submillimeter band.
This technique is based on the addition on the front of the array of an
anti-reflecting dielectric layer. The optimum parameters (layer thickness and
distance to the array) are determined by a 2D analytic code. This general
principle is applied to the case of the Herschel PACS bolometers (optimized for

quantized vortices in superfluid neutron stars have been suggested as one of
the possible explanations for the timing noise observed in many radio pulsars,
in particular for the 100-1000 day variations in the spin of PSR B1828-11. Most
studies to date have, however, been based on the hydrodynamics developed for
superfluid Helium. In this paper we extend the formulation to a two fluid
neutron and proton system, relevant for neutron star interiors and include the
effect of chemical coupling, compressibility and mutual friction between the
components. In particular we find that chemical coupling and compressibility
can have a drastic effect on the mode structure. However, for the slower
pulsars rotating at 1-10 Hz (such as PSR 1828-11), most choices of parameters
in the equation of state lead to Tkachenko oscillations with frequencies in the
correct range to explain the timing noise. We also investigate the case of more
rapidly rotating pulsars (above 100 Hz) for which we find that there is a vast
portion of parameter space in which there are no Tkachenko modes, but only
modified sound waves at much higher frequencies.

causal relationship between photospheric flows and coronal tether-cutting
reconnections is evidenced by the detection of persistent converging flows
toward the PIL using line-of-sight magnetograms obtained by the Helioseismic

s-1 about 10 minutes prior to the onset of a GOES-class C3.2 flare, as the

eventually leads to a loop-like coronal mass ejection (CME). The AIA
observations combined with H? filtergrams as well as hard X-ray (HXR) imaging

is placed on those reactions that have been identified, by sensitivity
analyses, as 'crucial' in determining the predicted abundances of the species
observed in the interstellar medium. These sensitivity analyses have been
carried out for gas-phase models of three representative, molecule-rich,
astronomical sources: the cold dense molecular clouds TMC-1 and L134N, and the
expanding circumstellar envelope IRC +10216. Our review has led to the proposal
of new values and uncertainties for the rate coefficients of many of the key

exploring the correlation between the core mass function obtained from the
fragmentation of a molecular cloud and the stellar mass function which forms
from these collapsing cores. Our analysis shows that the distributions of bound
cores and sink particles obtained in the simulations are consistent with the
sinks being formed predominantly from their parent core mass reservoir, with a
statistical dispersion of the order of one third of the core mass. Such a
characteristic dispersion suggests that the stellar initial mass function is
relatively tightly correlated to the parent core mass function, leading to two
similar distributions, as observed. This in turn argues in favor of the IMF
being essentially determined at the early stages of core formation and being
only weakly affected by the various environmental factors beyond the initial
core mass reservoir, at least in the mass range explored in the present study.
Accordingly, the final IMF of a star forming region should be determined
reasonably accurately, statistically speaking, from the initial core mass
function, provided some uniform efficiency factor. The calculations also show
that these statistical fluctuations, due e.g. to variations among the core
properties, broaden the low-mass tail of the IMF compared with the parent CMF,
providing an explanation for the fact that this latter appears to underestimate
the number of ""pre brown dwarf"" cores compared with the observationally-derived
brown dwarf IMF.

flares displayed four homologous H-alpha ribbons and were both accompanied by
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The central flare ribbons were located at the
site of an emerging bipole in the center of the active region. The negative
polarity of this bipole fragmented in two main pieces, one rotating around the
positive polarity by ~ 110 deg within 32 hours. We model the coronal magnetic
field and compute its topology, using as boundary condition the magnetogram
closest in time to each flare. In particular, we calculate the location of
quasiseparatrix layers (QSLs) in order to understand the connectivity between
the flare ribbons. Though several polarities were present in AR 10501, the
global magnetic field topology corresponds to a quadrupolar magnetic field
distribution without magnetic null points. For both flares, the photospheric
traces of QSLs are similar and match well the locations of the four H-alpha
ribbons. This globally unchanged topology and the continuous shearing by the
rotating bipole are two key factors responsible for the flare homology.
However, our analyses also indicate that different magnetic connectivity
domains of the quadrupolar configuration become unstable during each flare, so
that magnetic reconnection proceeds differently in both events.

Mpc regions of dynamically disturbed galaxy clusters (radio halos). The
morphological and spectral properties of these sources suggest that the
emitting electrons are accelerated by spatially distributed and gentle
mechanisms, providing some indirect evidence for turbulent acceleration in the
inter-galactic-medium (IGM). Radio and X-ray surveys allow to investigate the
statistics of radio halos and unveil a bimodal behaviour of the radio
properties of galaxy clusters: merging clusters host radio halos and trace the
well known radio--X correlation, while more relaxed clusters do not host radio
halos and populate a region well separated from that spanned by the above
correlation. This appears consistent with the hypothesis that relativistic
electrons can be reaccelerated by MHD turbulence generated during cluster
mergers. In the context of this model the population of radio halos consists of
a mixture of halos with different spectral properties, most of them with very
steep spectrum and visible only at low radio frequencies. For this reason the
future LOFAR surveys may provide a robust test to this theoretical hypothesis.

knowing the details of the quantum gravity"" and quite correct deduction of the
Unruh temperature (but not whole Unruh radiation process!). Firstly, we shall
directly apply usual consequences of the Unruh radiation and temperature at
surface gravity of a large spherical physical system and we shall show that
corresponding thermal energy can be formally quite correctly presented as the
potential energy absolute value of the classical gravitational interaction
between this large and a small quantum system with well defined
characteristics. Secondly, we shall inversely ""postulate"" small quantum system
with necessary well defined characteristics and then, after ""supposition"" on
the equivalence between potential energy absolute value of its gravitational
interaction with large system with thermal energy, we shall obtain exact value
of the Unruh temperature. Moreover, by very simple and correct application of
suggested formalism (with small quantum system) at thermodynamic laws, we shall
successfully study other thermodynamic characteristics, especially entropy,
characteristic for Unruh and Hawking radiation
