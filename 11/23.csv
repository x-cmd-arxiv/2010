of the planetary auroral radio emissions. Most likely, the same mechanism
produces radio bursts from ultracool dwarfs. We investigate amplification of
plasma waves by the horseshoe-like electron distribution (similar to those
observed in the terrestrial magnetosphere) as well as relaxation of this
distribution due to the ECMI. We aim to determine parameters of the generated
plasma waves, timescales of the relaxation process, and the conversion
efficiency of the particle energy into waves. We have developed a kinetic
relativistic quasi-linear 2D code for simulating the coevolution of an electron
distribution and the high-frequency plasma waves. The code includes the
processes of wave growth and particle diffusion which are assumed to be much
faster than other processes (particle injection, etc.). A number of simulations
have been performed for different parameter sets which seem to be typical for
the magnetospheres of ultracool dwarfs (in particular, the plasma frequency is
much less than the cyclotron one). The calculations have shown that the
fundamental extraordinary mode dominates strongly. The generated waves have the
frequency slightly below the electron cyclotron frequency and propagate across
the magnetic field. The final intensities of other modes are negligible. The
conversion efficiency of the electron energy into the extraordinary waves is
typically around 10%. Complete relaxation of the unstable electron distribution
takes much less than a second. Energy efficiency of the ECMI is more than
sufficient to provide the observed intensity of radio emission from ultracool
dwarfs. On the other hand, the observed light curves of the emission are not
related to the properties of this instability and reflect, most likely,
dynamics of the electron acceleration process and/or geometry of the radiation
source.

whether statistical properties are self-averaging within the sample. We find
that there are systematic differences in the shape of the PDF and in the
location of its peak, signaling that there are major systematic effects in the

this sample. We discuss that these systematic effects are related to the
fluctuating behavior of the redshift counts which can be originated by
intrinsic fluctuations in the galaxy density field or by observational
selection effects. The latter possibility implies that more than 20 % of the

System's irregular satellites are collisionally evolved. We derive a general
model for the collisional evolution of an irregular satellite swarm and apply
it to the Solar System and extrasolar planets. Our model reproduces the Solar
System's complement of observed irregulars well, and suggests that the
competition between grain-grain collisions and Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag
helps set the fate of the dust. Because swarm collision rates decrease over
time the main dust sink can change with time, and may help unravel the
accretion history of synchronously rotating regular satellites that show
brightness asymmetries. Some level of dust must be present on AU scales around
the Solar System's giant planets, which we predict may be at detectable levels.
We also predict whether dust produced by extrasolar circumplanetary swarms can
be detected. The coronagraphic instruments on JWST will have the ability to
detect the dust generated by these swarms, which are most detectable around
planets that orbit at tens of AU from the youngest stars. Because the
collisional decay of swarms is relatively insensitive to planet mass, swarms
can be much brighter than their host planets and allow discovery of
Neptune-mass planets that would otherwise remain invisible. This dust may have
already been detected. The observations of the planet Fomalhaut b can be
explained as scattered light from dust produced by the collisional decay of an
irregular satellite swarm around a 10 Earth-mass planet. Such a swarm comprises
about 5 Lunar masses worth of irregular satellites. Finally, we consider what
happens if Fomalhaut b passes through Fomalhaut's main debris ring, which
allows the circumplanetary swarm to be replenished through collisions with ring
planetesimals. (abridged)

Unfortunately, the popular preparation methods of micromechanical cleavage and

are many challenges, not least of which is the absence of an understanding of
the complex atomistic assembly kinetics of graphene. Here, we present a simple
rate theory of epitaxial graphene growth on close-packed metal surfaces. Based
on recent low-energy electron-diffraction microscopy experiments (LEEM)
\cite{loginova09}, our theory supposes that graphene islands grow predominantly
by the addition of five-atom clusters, rather than solely by the capture of
diffusing carbon atoms. With suitably chosen kinetic parameters, our theory
produces a time-dependent carbon adatom density that is in quantitative
agreement with measured data. The temperature-dependence of this adatom density
at the onset of nucleation leads us to predict that the smallest stable
precursor to graphene growth is an immobile island composed of six five-atom
clusters. Our findings provide a starting point for more detailed simulations
which will yield important input to developing strategies for the large-scale
production of epitaxial graphene.

accordance with the need for predicting Einstein gravity from string theory.
The mass of the Dilaton is evaluated to be also a high value close to the
Planck mass, which implies the absence of Dilaton scalar signals in modern
cosmological observations. These properties arise when the fermion mass is
chosen to be either at a lower bound corresponding to the top quark mass, or
alternatively, at a very much higher value assumed to be in the grand

the non leading logarithmic contribution and the inclusion of higher loops
terms could made more precise the numerical estimates of the vacuum field value
and masses, but seemingly are expected not to change the qualitative behavior
obtained. The validity of the here employed Yukawa model approximation is
argued for small value of the fermion masses with respect to the Planck one. A

the fluctuation dominated regime drastically and that in these materials the
spatial extent of homogeneity is limited, we explore the relevance of the zero
dimensional (0D)-model, neglecting thermal fluctuations. It is shown that both,
the full 0D-model as well as its Gaussian approximation, mimic the essential
features of the isothermal magnetization curves in Pb nanoparticles and various
cuprates remarkably well. This analysis also provides estimates for the spatial
extent of the homogeneous domains giving rise to a smeared transition in zero
magnetic field. The resulting estimates for the amplitude of the in-plane
correlation length exhibit a doping dependence reflecting the flow to the
quantum phase transition in the underdoped limit. Furthermore it is shown that
the isothermal Nernst signal of a superconducting Nb_(0.15)Si_(0.85) film is
fully consistent with this scenario. Accordingly, the observed diamagnetism
above T_c in Pb nanoparticles, in the cuprates La_(1.91)Sr_(0.09)CuO_4 and
BiSr_2Ca_2CuO_(8-d), as well as the Nernst signal in Nb_(0.15)Si_(0.85) films,
are all in excellent agreement with the scaling properties emerging from the
0D-model, giving a universal perspective on the interplay between diamagnetism,
Nernst signal, correlation length, and the limited spatial extent of
homogeneity. Our analysis also provides evidence that singlet Cooper pairs
subjected to orbital pair breaking in a 0D system are the main source of the
observed diamagnetism and Nernst signal in an extended temperature window above
T_c.

belt analog, and an inner disk of warm dust. Spitzer/IRS measurements indicate
that the warm dust is present at distances as close as a few AU from the star.
Its origin is puzzling, since an ""asteroid belt"" that could produce this dust
would be unstable because of the known inner planet. Aims: Here we test the
hypothesis that the observed warm dust is generated by collisions in the outer
belt and is transported inward by Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag and strong
stellar winds. Methods: We simulated a steady-state distribution of dust
particles outside 10AU with a collisional code and in the inner region (r<10AU)
with single-particle numerical integrations. By assuming homogeneous spherical
dust grains composed of water ice and silicate, we calculated the thermal
emission of the dust and compared it with observations. We investigated two
different orbital configurations for the inner planet inferred from RV
measurements, one with a highly eccentric orbit of e=0.7 and another one with a
moderate one of e=0.25. We also produced a simulation without a planet.
Results: Our models can reproduce the shape and magnitude of the observed SED
from mid-IR to sub-mm wavelengths, as well as the Spitzer/MIPS radial
brightness profiles. The best-fit dust composition includes both ice and
silicates. The results are similar for the two possible planetary orbits and
without a planet. Conclusions: The observed warm dust in the system can indeed
stem from the outer belt and be transported inward by P-R and stellar wind
drag. The inner planet has little effect on the distribution of dust, so that
the planetary orbit could not be constrained. Reasonable agreement between the
model and observations can only be achieved by relaxing the assumption of
purely silicate dust and assuming a mixture of silicate and ice in comparable
amounts.

neutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovae may develop global
non-axisymmetric instabilities even when $T/|W|$ (the ratio of the rotational
kinetic energy $T$ to the gravitational potential energy $|W|$) is relatively
small (less than 0.1). Such low-$T/|W|$ instability can give rise to efficient
gravitational wave emission from the proto-neutron star. We investigate how
this instability is affected by magnetic fields using a cylindrical stellar
model. Wave absorption at the corotation resonance plays an important role in
facilitating the hydrodynamic low-$T/|W|$ instability. In the presence of a
toroidal magnetic field, the corotation resonance is split into two magnetic
resonances where wave absorptions take place. We show that the toroidal
magnetic field suppresses the low-$T/|W|$ instability when the total magnetic
energy $W_{\rm B}$ is of order $0.2\,T$ or larger, corresponding to toroidal
fields of a few $\times 10^{16}$ G or stronger. Although poloidal magnetic
fields do not influence the instability directly, they can affect the
instability by generating toroidal fields through linear winding of the initial
poloidal field and magneto-rotational instability. We show that an initial
poloidal field with strength as small as $10^{14}$ G may suppress the
low-$T/|W|$ instability.

control by genuine (non-illusory) free will. We propose that an indeterministic

acts by altering the probability distribution over allowed outcomes. In the
quantum physical world, such a FW can collapse the wave function, introducing
deviations from the Born rule. In principle, this deviation would stand in
conflict with both special relativity and (a variant of) the Strong
Church-Turing thesis, implying that the brain may be an arena of exotic,
non-standard physics. However, in practice, these deviations would not be
directly or easily observable, because they occur in sub-neuronal
superpositions in the brain, where they would be shrouded in random measurement
errors, noise and statistical fluctuations. Our result elucidates the
difference between the FW of human observers and that of observed particles in
the Free Will Theorem. This difference is a basic reason for why FW (and, in
general, consciousness) cannot be recreated by standard artificial intelligence
(AI) technology. We propose various neurobiological experiments to test our
proposed theory. We speculate that for observers to be aware of a physical
theory such as quantum mechanics, FW is necessary and that the theory must
therefore not be universal. We suggest that FW may be regarded as a primitive
principle in Nature for explaining quantum indeterminism.

overall density of bosons alone, would yield the DFT of Nunes (1999). It is
argued that a significant improvement in accuracy may be obtained by using
additional density fields: the condensate amplitude and the anomalous density.
Thus, two advanced schemes are suggested, one corresponding to a generalized
two-fluid model of condensate systems, and another scheme which explicitly
accounts for anomalous density contributions and anomalous effective
potentials. The latter reduces to the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach in the
limit of weak interactions. For stronger interactions, a local density
approximation is suggested, but its implementation requires accurate data for
the thermodynamic properties of uniform interacting BEC systems, including
fictitious perturbed states of such systems. Provided that such data becomes

have masses inferred (from their parallaxes and 2MASS K-band magnitudes) to be
between the hydrogen burning limit and 0.35 Msol, and thus should remain
fully-convective throughout their lifetimes. We measure a wide range of
rotation periods, from 0.28 days to 154 days, with the latter commensurate with
the typical sensitivity limit of our observations. Using kinematics as a proxy
for age, we find that the majority of objects likely to be thick disk or halo
members (and hence, on average, older) rotate very slowly, with a median period
of 92 days, compared to 0.7 days for those likely to be thin disk members (on
average, younger), although there are still some rapid rotators in the thick
disk sample. When combined with literature measurements for M-dwarfs, these
results indicate an increase in spin-down times with decreasing stellar mass,
in agreement with previous work, and that the spin-down time becomes comparable
to the age of the thick disk sample below the fully-convective boundary. We
additionally infer that the spin-down must remove a substantial amount of
angular momentum once it begins in order to produce the slow rotators we
observe in the thick disk candidates, suggesting that fully-convective M-dwarfs
may still experience strong winds.

conductivity anisotropy observed in optics is consistent with a weakly
temperature dependent dc conductivity and anisotropy at high temperatures. The
splitting of the molecular vibrations nu27(Bu) evidences the abrupt onset of
static charge order below TCO=136 K. The drop of optical conductivity measured
within the ab plane of the crystal is characterized by an isotropic gap that
opens of approximately 75 meV with several phonons becoming pronounced below.
Conversely, the dc conductivity anisotropy rises steeply, attaining at 50 K a
value 25 times larger than at high temperatures. The dielectric response within
this plane reveals two broad relaxation modes of strength Deltaepsilon_LD ~=
5000 and Deltaepsilon_SD ~= 400, centered at 1 kHz < f_LD < 100 MHz and f_SD ~=
1 MHz. The anisotropy of the large-mode (LD) mean relaxation time closely
follows the temperature behavior of the respective dc conductivity ratio. We
argue that this phason-like excitation is best described as a long-wavelength
excitation of a 2kF bond-charge density wave expected theoretically for layered
quarter-filled electronic systems with horizontal stripes. Conversely, based on
the theoretically expected ferroelectric-like nature of the charge-ordered
phase, we associate the small-mode (SD) relaxation with the motion of
domain-wall pairs, created at the interface between two types of domains, along
the a and b axes. We also consider other possible theoretical interpretations

computed using a fast GLAM (Generalized Linear Array Model) algorithm, and
comparable to them in terms of mean squared integrated errors. We extend the
sandwich smoother to array data of higher dimensions, where a GLAM algorithm
improves the computational speed of the sandwich smoother. One important
application of the sandwich smoother is to estimate covariance functions in
functional data analysis. In this application, our numerical results show that
the sandwich smoother is orders of magnitude faster than local linear
regression. The speed of the sandwich formula is important because functional
data sets are becoming quite large.

they radiate away gravitational energy acquired during their formation. A major
area of contention in the extrasolar planet community is whether outer planets
(> 10 AU) more massive than Jupiter form via one-step gravitational
instabilities or, rather, via a two-step process involving accretion of a core
followed by accumulation of a massive outer envelope composed primarily of
hydrogen and helium. Here we report the presence of a fourth planet, interior
to and about the same mass as the other three. The system, with this additional
planet, represents a challenge for current planet formation models as none of
them can explain the in situ formation of all four planets. With its four young
giant planets and known cold/warm debris belts, the HR 8799 planetary system is
a unique laboratory to study the formation and evolution of giant planets at

of nonlinear phenomena occurring on small scales in general relativity. Our
approach is an adaptation of Burnett's formulation of the ""shortwave
approximation"", which we generalize to analyze the effects of matter
inhomogeneities as well as gravitational radiation. Our framework requires the
metric to be close to a ""background metric"", but allows arbitrarily large
stress-energy fluctuations on small scales. We prove that, within our
framework, if the matter stress-energy tensor satisfies the weak energy
condition (i.e., positivity of energy density in all frames), then the only
effect that small scale inhomogeneities can have on the dynamics of the
background metric is to provide an ""effective stress-energy tensor"" that is
traceless and has positive energy density---corresponding to the presence of
gravitational radiation. In particular, nonlinear effects produced by small
scale inhomogeneities cannot mimic the effects of dark energy. We also develop
""perturbation theory"" off of the background metric. We derive an equation for
the ""long-wavelength part"" of the leading order deviation of the metric from
the background metric, which contains the usual terms occurring in linearized
perturbation theory plus additional contributions from the small-scale
inhomogeneities. Under various assumptions concerning the absence of
gravitational radiation and the non-relativistic behavior of the matter, we
argue that the ""short wavelength"" deviations of the metric from the background
metric near a point $x$ should be accurately described by Newtonian gravity,
taking into account only the matter lying within a ""homogeneity lengthscale"" of
$x$. Finally, we argue that our framework should provide an accurate
description of the actual universe.

metal-poor red horizontal branch star belonging to a stellar halo stream that
results from the disruption of an ancient Milky Way satellite galaxy. The
detection is based on radial velocity observations with FEROS at the 2.2-m
MPG/ESO telescope. The periodic radial velocity variation of P=16.2 days can be
distinguished from the periods of the stellar activity indicators. We computed
a minimum planetary mass of 1.25 Jupiter masses and an orbital semimajor axis
of 0.116 AU for the planet. This discovery is unique in three aspects: First,
it is the first planet detection around a star with a metallicity much lower
than few percent of the solar value; second, the planet host star resides in a
stellar evolutionary stage that is still unexplored in the exoplanet surveys;
third, the planetary system HIP 13044 most likely has an extragalactic origin
in a disrupted former satellite of the Milky Way.

revisited from the viewpoint that one should not ban a standard-model-like
false vacuum as long as it is long-lived on a cosmological timescale. The
vacuum transition rate is evaluated numerically by searching for the bounce
configuration. Like stability, a metastability bound does not decouple even if
sfermion masses grow. Apart from being more generous than stability, the new
bounds are largely independent of Yukawa couplings except for the stop
trilinears. With vacuum longevity imposed on otherwise arbitrary LR insertions,
it is found that a super flavour factory has the potential to probe sparticle
masses up to a few TeV through B and tau physics whereas the MEG experiment
might cover a far wider range. In the stop sector, metastability is more
restrictive than any existing experimental constraint such as from electroweak
precision data. Also discussed are dependency on other parameters and
reliability under radiative corrections.

modifications will take the guise of additional gauge and scalar fields for the
so-called Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theories with an exponential Liouville
potential; and of extra spatial dimensions for Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories.
The black-hole solutions of EMD theories as well as their integrability are
reviewed. One of the main results is that a master equation is obtained in the
case of planar horizon topology, which allows to completely integrate the
problem for s special relationship between the couplings. We also classify
existing solutions. We move on to the study of Gauss-Bonnet black holes,
focusing on the six-dimensional case. It is found that the Gauss-Bonnet
coupling exposes the Weyl tensor of the horizon to the dynamics, severely
restricting the Einstein spaces admissible and effectively lifting some of the
degeneracy on the horizon topology. We then turn to the study of the
thermodynamic properties of black holes, in General Relativity as well as in
EMD theories. For the latter, phase transitions may be found in the canonical
ensemble, which resemble the phase transitions for Reissner-Nordstr\""om black
holes. Generically, we find that the thermodynamic properties (stability, order
of phase transitions) depend crucially on the values of the EMD coupling
constants. Finally, we interpret our planar EMD solutions holographically as
Infra-Red geometries through the AdS/CFT correspondence, taking into account
various validity constraints. We also compute AC and DC conductivities as
applications to Condensed Matter Systems, and find some properties
characteristic of strange metal behaviour.

This effect is examined for two supersymmetry breaking scenarios. It is found
that models of minimal gauge mediation (which necessarily have a messenger

the messenger mass is greater than 10^8 GeV. Similarly the ISS model, in the

mean surface brightness, and integrated stellar kinematics, suffice to
unambiguously differentiate galaxies from star clusters, which presumably
formed differently and lack dark matter halos. We find that star clusters lie
on the galaxy scaling relationship referred to as the Fundamental Manifold
(FM), on the extension of a sequence of compact galaxies, and so conclude that
there is no simple way to differentiate star clusters from ultra-compact
galaxies. By extending the validity of the FM over a larger range of parameter
space and a wider set of objects, we demonstrate that the physics that
constrains the resulting baryon and dark matter distributions in stellar
systems is more general than previously appreciated. The generality of the FM
implies 1) that the stellar spatial distribution and kinematics of one type of
stellar system do not arise solely from a process particular to that set of
systems, such as violent relaxation for elliptical galaxies, but are instead
the result of an interplay of all processes responsible for the generic
settling of baryons in gravitational potential wells, 2) that the physics of
how baryons settle is independent of whether the system is embedded within a
dark matter halo, and 3) that peculiar initial conditions at formation or
stochastic events during evolution do not ultimately disturb the overall
regularity of baryonic settling. We also utilize the relatively simple nature
of star clusters to relate deviations from the FM to the age of the stellar
population and find that stellar population models systematically and
significantly over predict the mass-to-light ratios of old, metal-rich
clusters.

luminosities as the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) population previously selected

rare: the covering fraction is ~ 10-15% between 20 and 100 kpc, for Mg II lines
with rest equivalent widths of Wr >= 0.6{\AA}, falling to zero at larger

cool Mg II-absorbing clouds may be absent near LRGs because of the environment
of the galaxies: if LRGs reside in high-mass groups and clusters, either their
halos are too hot to retain or accrete cool gas, or the galaxies themselves -
which have passively-evolving old stellar populations - do not produce the
rates of star formation and outflows of gas necessary to fill their halos with
Mg II absorbing clouds. In the rarer cases where Mg II is detected, however,
the origin of the absorption is less clear. Absorption may arise from the
little cool gas able to reach into cluster halos from the intergalactic medium,

higher. The partition of gas into different thermal components must itself
depend on the star formation rate, since a steady state distribution requires a
balance between heating (largely from stellar UV for the atomic component) and
cooling. In this presentation, I discuss a simple thermal and dynamical
equilibrium model for the star formation rate in disk galaxies, where the basic
inputs are the total surface density of gas and the volume density of stars and
dark matter, averaged over ~kpc scales. Galactic environment is important
because the vertical gravity of the stars and dark matter compress gas toward
the midplane, helping to establish the pressure, and hence the cooling rate. In
equilibrium, the star formation rate must evolve until the gas heating rate is
high enough to balance this cooling rate and maintain the pressure imposed by
the local gravitational field. In addition to discussing the formulation of
this equilibrium model, I review the current status of numerical simulations of
multiphase disks, focusing on measurements of quantities that characterize the
mean properties of the diffuse ISM. Based on simulations, turbulence levels in
the diffuse ISM appear relatively insensitive to local disk conditions and
energetic driving rates, consistent with observations. It remains to be
determined, both from observations and simulations, how mass exchange processes
control the ratio of cold-to-warm gas in the atomic ISM.

naturally predict vanishing $\theta_{13}$ and maximal $\theta_{23}$, while the

hydrodynamic simulations, we propose a novel theoretical model of first cores,
Exposed Long-lifetime First core (ELF). In the very low-mass molecular core,
the first core evolves slowly and lives longer than 10,000 years because the
accretion rate is considerably low. The evolution of ELFs is different from
that of ordinary first cores because radiation cooling has a significant effect
there. We also carry out radiation transfer calculation of dust-continuum
emission from ELFs to predict their observational properties. ELFs have
slightly fainter but similar SEDs to ordinary first cores in radio wavelengths,
therefore they can be observed. Although the probabilities that such low mass
cores become gravitationally unstable and start to collapse are low, we still
can expect that a considerable number of ELFs can be formed because there are
many low-mass molecular cloud cores in star-forming regions that can be
progenitors of ELFs.

family of hash function, which brings out a meaningful output-sensitive term in
the complexity of the problem. Our analysis, combined with a non-isometric
lifting of the data, enables us to answer exhaustive $r$-\pleb queries (and
down the road reverse nearest neighbors queries) efficiently. Along the way, we
obtain a simple algorithm for answering exact nearest neighbor queries, whose

(SDSS, data release 7) at low redhift (z <0.2), we developed a test of
galaxy-size evolution. For this first quantitative size analysis using SDSS
data, several possible sources of systematic errors had to be considered. The
Malmquist bias is excluded by volume-limited samples. A correction for seeing
has been developed and applied. We compare different methods to perform the
K-correction, and avoid selection effects due to different filters. It is found
that apparent average galaxy size slightly decreases with redshift z,
corresponding to a growth in time. The effect is smaller for a lower H0, and at
the same time less pronounced at higher redshifts, but persists in both cases.
Although there is no systematic variation with galaxy luminosity, we took into
account the recently discovered luminosity evolution with redshift. Assuming
this effect of unknown origin to be real, we find a slight increase of galaxy
size with z. The relative change of average size with z usually amounts to less
than one half of the respective increase of wavelengths due to the cosmological
redshift, making a cosmological interpretation difficult. While the effect
shows clear statistical significance, unknown systematics cannot be excluded.
In any case, the enigmatic observations of size and luminosity evolution need
to be analysed together. To facilitate further investigations, a complete
Mathematica code and instructions for data download are provided.

of scheduling a set of jobs on unrelated machines to minimize the makespan. The
best known approximation algorithm for this problem guarantees an approximation
factor of 2. It is known to be NP-hard to approximate with a better ratio than
3/2. Closing this gap has been open for over 20 years. The best known
approximation factors are achieved by LP-based algorithms. The strongest known
linear program formulation for the problem is the configuration-LP. We show
that the configuration-LP has an integrality gap of 2 even for the special case
of unrelated graph balancing, where each job can be assigned to at most two
machines. In particular, our result implies that a large family of cuts does
not help to diminish the integrality gap of the canonical assignment-LP. Also,
we present cases of the problem which can be approximated with a better factor
than 2. They constitute valuable insights for constructing an NP-hardness
reduction which improves the known lower bound. Very recently Svensson studied
the restricted assignment case, where each job can only be assigned to a given
set of machines on which it has the same processing time. He shows that in this
setting the configuration-LP has an integrality gap of 33/17<2. Hence, our
result imply that the unrelated graph balancing case is significantly more
complex than the restricted assignment case. Then we turn to another objective
function: maximizing the minimum machine load. For the case that every job can
be assigned to at most two machines we give a purely combinatorial
2-approximation algorithm which is best possible, unless P=NP. This improves on
the computationally costly LP-based (2+eps)-approximation algorithm by
Chakrabarty et al.

sample of multi-band SNe Ibc light curves available to date. We correct the
light curves for host galaxy extinction using a new technique based on the
photometric color evolution, namely, we show that the (V-R) color of
extinction-corrected SNe Ibc at t\approx10 days after V-band maximum is tightly
distributed, (V-R)=0.26+-0.06 mag. Using this technique, we find that SNe Ibc
typically suffer from significant host galaxy extinction, E(B-V)\approx0.4 mag.
A comparison of the extinction-corrected light curves for SNe Ib and Ic reveals
that they are statistically indistinguishable, both in luminosity and decline
rate. We report peak absolute magnitudes of M_R=-17.9+-0.9 mag and
M_R=-18.3+-0.6 mag for SNe Ib and Ic, respectively. Focusing on the broad-lined
SNe Ic, we find that they are more luminous than the normal SNe Ibc sample,
M_R=-19.0+-1.1 mag, with a probability of only 1.6% that they are drawn from

presently surrounding the heliosphere extends less than 0.1 pc in the upwind
direction, terminating at an unknown distance, indicating that the outer
boundary conditions of the heliosphere could change during the lifetime of the
IBEX satellite. Using reasonable values for future outer heliosphere boundary
conditions, ENA fluxes are predicted for one possible source of ENAs coming
from outside of the heliopause. The ENA production simulations use
three-dimensional MHD plasma models of the heliosphere that include a kinetic
description of neutrals and a Lorentzian distribution for ions. Based on this
ENA production model, it is then shown that the sensitivities of the IBEX 1.1
keV skymaps are sufficient to detect the variations in ENA fluxes that are
expected to accompany the solar transition into the next upwind cloud.
Approximately 20% of the IBEX 1.1 keV pixels appear capable of detecting the
predicted model differences at the $ 3 \sigma$ level, with these pixels
concentrated in the Ribbon region. Regardless of the detailed ENA production
model, the success of the modeled \BdotR\ directions in reproducing the Ribbon
locus, together with our results, indicate that the Ribbon phenomenon traces
the variations in the heliosphere distortion caused by the relative pressures
of the interstellar magnetic and gaseous components.

a galaxy's stellar mass or luminosity and the mass of its parent dark matter
halo or subhalo. We examine the accuracy of SHAM in two cosmological SPH
simulations, one of which includes momentum-driven winds. The SPH simulations
indeed show a nearly monotonic relation between stellar mass and halo mass
provided that, for satellite galaxies, we use the mass of the subhalo at the
epoch when it became a satellite. In each simulation, the median relation for
central and satellite galaxies is nearly identical, though a somewhat larger
fraction of satellites are outliers. SHAM-assigned masses (at z=0-2),
luminosities (R-band at z=0), or star formation rates (at z=2) have a 68%
scatter of 0.09-0.15 dex relative to the true simulation values. When we apply
SHAM to the subhalo population of collisionless N-body simulation with the same
initial conditions as the SPH runs, we find generally good agreement for the
halo occupation distributions and halo radial profiles of galaxy samples
defined by thresholds in stellar mass. However, because a small fraction of SPH
galaxies suffer severe stellar mass loss after becoming satellites, SHAM
slightly overpopulates high mass halos; this effect is more significant for the
wind simulation, which produces galaxies that are less massive and more
fragile. SHAM recovers the two-point correlation function of the SPH galaxies
in the no-wind simulation to better than 10% at scales 0.1 < r < 10 Mpc/h. For
the wind simulation, agreement is better than 15% at r > 2 Mpc/h, but

on average younger, less metal rich, and less enhanced in the alpha-elements
than giants, in agreement with the extrapolation to the low mass regime of the
scaling relations derived for giant ETGs. From the total (dwarf + giant) sample
we derive that age \propto sigma^{0.39 \pm 0.22}, Z \propto sigma^{0.80 \pm
0.16}, and alpha/Fe \propto sigma^{0.42 \pm 0.22}. We also find correlations
with morphology, in the sense that the metallicity and the [alpha/Fe] ratio
increase with the Sersic index n or with the bulge-to-total light fraction B/T.
The presence of a strong morphology-[alpha/Fe] relation appears to be in
contradiction to the possible evolution along the Hubble sequence from low B/T
(low n) to high B/T (high n) galaxies. We also investigate the role played by
environment comparing the properties of our LDE dwarfs with those of Coma red
passive dwarfs from the literature. We find possible evidence that LDE dwarfs

neutron lies in the future; measurement of a nuclear EDM may well come first.
The deuteron is one nucleus for which exact model calculations are feasible.
Purpose: We explore the model dependence of deuteron EDM calculations. Methods:
Using a separable potential formulation of the Hamiltonian, we examine the
sensitivity of the deuteron EDM to variation in the nucleon-nucleon
interaction. We write the EDM as the sum of two terms, the first depending on
the target wave function with plane-wave intermediate states, and the second
depending on intermediate multiple scattering in the 3P1 channel, the latter
being sensitive to the off-shell behavior of the 3P1 amplitude. Results: We
compare the full calculation with the plane-wave approximation result, examine
the tensor force contribution to the model results, and explore the effect of
short range repulsion found in realistic, contemporary potential models of the
deuteron. Conclusions: Because one-pion exchange dominates the EDM calculation,
separable potential model calculations will provide an adequate description of
the 2H EDM until such time as a better than 10% measurement is obtained.

reward state of each arm transits according to an unknown Markovian rule when
it is played and evolves according to an arbitrary unknown random process when

regret, defined as the reward loss with respect to the case where the player
knows which M arms are the most rewarding and always plays the M best arms. We
construct a policy with an interleaving exploration and exploitation epoch
structure that achieves a regret with logarithmic order when arbitrary (but
nontrivial) bounds on certain system parameters are known. When no knowledge
about the system is available, we show that the proposed policy achieves a
regret arbitrarily close to the logarithmic order. We further extend the
problem to a decentralized setting where multiple distributed players share the
arms without information exchange. Under both an exogenous restless model and
an endogenous restless model, we show that a decentralized extension of the
proposed policy preserves the logarithmic regret order as in the centralized
setting. The results apply to adaptive learning in various dynamic systems and

starting from the atomic non-Kramers magnetic doublets and performing the
strong-coupling perturbation expansion of the virtual electron transfer between

then studied by means of a classical mean-field theory and the exact
diagonalization on a single tetrahedron and on a 16-site cluster. These
calculations reveal appreciable quantum fluctuations leading to quantum phase
transitions to a quadrupolar state as a melting of spin ice for the Pr^{3+}

decreased. This model then influenced the design of a new mount that improved
the isolation to -65 dB at 6 GHz, even though the chip dimensions were

radio relics, and the second of those with a giant radio halo (GRH), as well.
It also contains unusual diffuse radio filaments interior to the peripheral
relics, and a clumpy, elongated X-ray structure. All of these indicate a very
actively evolving system, with ongoing accretion and merger activity,
illuminating a network of shocks, such as those first seen in numerical
simulations. The peripheral relics are most easily understood as outgoing
spherical merger shocks with large variations in brightness along them, likely
reflecting the inhomogeneities in the shocks' magnetic fields . The interior
filaments could be projections of substructures from the sheet-like peripheral
shocks, or they might be separate structures due to multiple accretion events.
ROSAT images show large-scale diffuse X-ray emission coincident with the GRH,
and additional patchy diffuse emission that suggests a recent merger event.
This uniquely rich set of radio shocks and halo offer the possibility, with
deeper X-ray, optical and data higher resolution radio observations, of testing
the models of how shocks and turbulence couple to the relativistic plasma.

radio-X-ray correlation for clusters -- the third example of such a system.
This new population of diffuse radio emission opens up the possibility of

asymmetric distribution of emitted radiation, and hence a recoil of the remnant
black hole directed opposite to the net linear momentum radiated. The recoil
velocity is generally largest for comparable mass black holes and particular
spin configurations, and approaches zero in the extreme mass ratio limit. It is
generally believed that for extreme mass ratios eta<<1, the scaling of the
recoil velocity is V {\propto} eta^2, where the proportionality coefficient
depends on the spin of the larger hole and the geometry of the system (e.g.
orbital inclination). Here we show that for low but nonzero inclination
prograde orbits and very rapidly spinning large holes (spin parameter
a*>0.9678) the inspiralling binary can pass through resonances where the
orbit-averaged radiation-reaction force is nonzero. These resonance crossings
lead to a new contribution to the kick, V {\propto} eta^{3/2}. For these
configurations and sufficiently extreme mass ratios, this resonant recoil is
dominant. While it seems doubtful that the resonant recoil will be
astrophysically significant, its existence suggests caution when extrapolating
the results of numerical kick results to extreme mass ratios and near-maximal
spins.

an investor who receives a stochastic cash flow which he/she must then invest
in a continuous-time financial market. For simplicity, we assume that there is
only one investment opportunity available for the investor, a risky stock.
Using techniques of stochastic linear-quadratic (LQ) control, the optimal
mean-variance investment strategy with and without VaR constraint are derived

law of the aftershock rate decay: the Levy and Inverse Gaussian (IGD)
distributions. These distributions are thought to describe stress behavior
influenced by various random factors: post-earthquake stress time history is
described by a Brownian motion. Both distributions decay to zero for time
intervals close to zero. But this feature contradicts the high immediate
aftershock level according to Omori's law. We propose that these statistical
distributions are influenced by the power-law stress distribution near the
earthquake focal zone and we derive new distributions as a mixture of power-law
stress with the exponent psi and Levy as well as IGD distributions. Such new
distributions describe the resulting inter-earthquake time intervals and
closely resemble Omori's law. The new Levy distribution has a pure power-law
form with the exponent -(1+psi/2) and the mixed IGD has two exponents: the same
as Levy for small time intervals and -(1+psi) for longer times. For even longer
time intervals this power-law behavior should be replaced by a uniform
seismicity rate corresponding to the long-term tectonic deformation. We compute
these background rates using our former analysis of earthquake size
distribution and its connection to plate tectonics. We analyze several
earthquake catalogs to confirm and illustrate our theoretical results. Finally,
we discuss how the parameters of random stress dynamics can be determined
through a more detailed statistical analysis of earthquake occurrence or by new
laboratory experiments.

survey with the HARPS spectrograph which aims at characterizing the population
of ice giants and super-Earths around nearby solar-type stars. This will lead
to a better understanding of their formation and evolution, and yield a global
picture of planetary systems from gas giants down to telluric planets. Methods.
Progress has been possible in this field thanks in particular to the sub-m/s
radial velocity precision achieved by HARPS. We present here new high-quality
measurements from this instrument. Results. We report the discovery of a
planetary system comprising at least five Neptune-like planets with minimum
masses ranging from 12 to 25 M_Earth, orbiting the solar-type star HD 10180 at
separations between 0.06 and 1.4 AU. A sixth radial velocity signal is present
at a longer period, probably due to a 65-M_Earth object. Moreover, another body
with a minimum mass as low as 1.4 M_Earth may be present at 0.02 AU from the
star. This is the most populated exoplanetary system known to date. The planets
are in a dense but still well-separated configuration, with significant secular
interactions. Some of the orbital period ratios are fairly close to integer or
half-integer values, but the system does not exhibit any mean-motion
resonances. General relativity effects and tidal dissipation play an important
role to stabilize the innermost planet and the system as a whole. Numerical
integrations show long-term dynamical stability provided true masses are within
a factor ~3 from minimum masses. We further note that several low-mass
planetary systems exhibit a rather ""packed"" orbital architecture with little or
no space left for additional planets. (Abridged)

photometric observations by the ASAS and MACHO projects which cover nearly 8-10
years, the period and amplitude of light variation are analyzed carefully using
both the PDM and Period04 methods. According to the properties of light
variation, these objects are classified into five categories: (1) 20 objects
are saturated in photometry or located in crowded stellar field with poor
photometric results, (2) 35 objects with too complex variation to have any
certain period, (3) 23 objects with irregular variation, (4) 16 objects with
semi-regular variation, and (5) 95 objects with Long Secondary Period (LSP)

shorter than 3000 days that can be determined with reasonable accuracy. For the
semi-regular variables and the LSP variables with distinguishable short period,
the period-luminosity relation is analyzed in the visual, near-infrared and
mid-infrared bands. It is found that the P-L relation is tight in the infrared
bands such as the 2MASS JHKs bands and the Spitzer/IRAC bands, in particular in
the Spitzer/IRAC [3.6] and [4.5] bands; meanwhile, the P-L relation is
relatively sparse in the V band which may be caused by the inhomogeneous
interstellar extinction. The results are compared with others' P-L

a routing scheme optimizing the traffic distribution so as to advance network
performance. However, optimize the link weights for OSPF to the offered traffic
is an known NP-hard problem. In this paper, motivated by the fairness concept
of congestion control, we firstly propose a new generic objective function,
where various interests of providers can be extracted with different parameter
settings. And then, we model the optimal TE as the utility maximization of
multi-commodity flows with the generic objective function and theoretically
show that any given set of optimal routes corresponding to a particular
objective function can be converted to shortest paths with respect to a set of
positive link weights. This can be directly configured on OSPF-based protocols.
On these bases, we employ the Network Entropy Maximization(NEM) framework and
develop a new OSPF-based routing protocol, SPEF, to realize a flexible way to
split traffic over shortest paths in a distributed fashion. Actually, comparing
to OSPF, SPEF only needs one more weight for each link and provably achieves
optimal TE. Numerical experiments have been done to compare SPEF with the
current version of OSPF, showing the effectiveness of SPEF in terms of link
utilization and network load distribution.

link-disjoint paths available per multi-path set. Also, the time between
zone-disjoint multi-path discoveries would be far lower than the time between

is no appreciable difference in the average hop counts per zone-disjoint,

more than the average minimum hop count determined using single-path routing.

two- dimensional soft-spin O(2) Ginzburg-Landau model when a reversible mode
cou- pling is included via the conserved conjugate momentum of the spin order
parameter (the model E). Coarsening of the system, when quenched from a dis-
ordered state to zero temperature, is observed to be enhanced by the existence
of the mode coupling terms. The growth of the characteristic length scale L(t)
exhibits an effective super-diffusive growth exponent that can be interpreted
as a positive logarithmic-like correction to a diffusive growth, i.e., L(t) ~
(t ln t)^{1/2}. In order to understand this behavior, we introduced a simple
phenomenological model of coarsening based on the annihilation dynamics of a
vortex-antivortex pair, incorporating the effect of vortex inertia and
logarithmically divergent mobility of the vortex. With a suitable choice of the
parameters, numerical solutions of the simple model can fit the full simulation
results very adequately. The effective growth exponent in the early time stage
is larger due to the effect of the vortex inertia, which crosses over into late
time stage characterized by positive logarithmic correction to a diffusive
growth. We also investigated the non-equilibrium autocorrelation function from
which the so called {\lambda} exponent can be extracted. We get {\lambda} =
1.99(2) which is distinctively larger than the value of {\lambda} = 1.17 for
the purely dissipative model-A dynamics of non-conserved O(2) models.

pulse period of ~604 sec is not stable, but changing erratically on timescales

peaked structure at low energies, the secondary pulse decreases rapidly with
increasing energy and above 20 keV only the primary pulse is visible. This
evolution is consistent between PCA, HEXTE, and ISGRI. The phase averaged
spectrum can be well described by the sum of a photoabsorbed power law with a

magnetisation process are analyzed in terms of the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB)
equation for different values of spin $S$. The LLB equation is equivalent in
the limit $S \rightarrow \infty$ to the atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG)
Langevin dynamics and for $S=1/2$ to the M3TM model [B. Koopmans, {\em et al.}
Nature Mat. \textbf{9} (2010) 259]. Within the LLB model the ultra-fast
demagnetisation time ($\tau_{M}$) and the transverse damping ($\alpha_{\perp}$)
are parameterized by the intrinsic coupling-to-the-bath parameter $\lambda$,
defined by microscopic spin-flip rate. We show that for the phonon-mediated
Elliott-Yafet mechanism, $\lambda$ is proportional to the ratio between the
non-equilibrium phonon and electron temperatures.
  We investigate the influence of the finite spin number and the scattering
rate parameter $\lambda$ on the magnetisation relaxation rates. The relation
between the fs demagnetisation rate and the LLG damping, provided by the LLB
theory, is checked basing on the available experimental data. A good agreement

B-meson decays into three charged pions are studied. The weak decay amplitudes
are calculated in the framework of the QCD factorization approximation. The
strong interactions between the pairs of pions are taken into account using
scalar and vector pion form factors. The scalar form factors are constrained by
data on pion-pion, kaon-antikaon and four pion production incorporated into a
multichannel model of the coupled amplitudes. The vector form factor is
obtained from the Belle Collaboration analysis of the tau- --> pi- pi0 nu_{tau}

compared with the corresponding results of the recent Dalitz plot analysis of
B+- --> pi+pi-pi+- decays performed by the BABAR Collaboration. We find that
the S-wave dipion amplitude, although much smaller than the P-wave amplitude,
plays an important role even in the rho(770) mass range. We show that the
helicity angle distribution is strongly asymmetric in the rho- meson range.
This effect can be attributed to the broad f0(600)(or sigma) meson. The fact
that the signal of the B+- --> f0(980) pi+- decay has not been found in the
experimental analysis can be easily explained in our model since the relevant B
decay amplitude is proportional to the scalar form factor which has a dip at
the f0(980) mass. We obtain a unified unitary description of the contribution

curve through different environments so characterizing normal extinction
curves. In this paper more than sixty curves with large ultraviolet deviations
from their best-fit one parameter curve are analyzed. These curves are fitted
with dust models to shed light into the properties of the grains, the processes
affecting them, and their relations with the environmental characteristics. The
extinction curve models are reckoned by following recent prescriptions on grain
size distributions able to describe one parameter curves for Rv values from 3.1
to 5.5. Such models, here extended down to Rv=2.0, allow us to compare the
resulting properties of our deviating curves with the same as normal curves in
a self-consistent framework, and thus to recover the relative trends overcoming
the modeling uncertainties. Such curves represent the larger and homogeneous
sample of anomalous curves studied so far with dust models. Results show that
the ultraviolet deviations are driven by a larger amount of small grains than
predicted for lines of sight where extinction depends on one parameter only.
Moreover, the dust-to-gas ratios of anomalous curves are lower than the same
values for no deviating lines of sight. Shocks and grain-grain collisions
should both destroy dust grains, so reducing the amount of the dust trapped
into the grains, and modify the size distribution of the dust, so increasing
the small-to-large grain size ratio. Therefore, the extinction properties
derived should arise along sight lines where shocks and high velocity flows
perturb the physical state of the interstellar medium living their signature on
the dust properties. (Abridged version)

possesses a term that can be identified as the approximation $\delta W_{ba}$ to
the compressible work of expansion/contraction $\delta W =-P {\rm d}\upsilon$,
where $P$ is the pressure and $\upsilon$ is the specific volume. It follows
that Boussinesq and anelastic fluids admit explicit compressible effects and
conversions between internal energy and mechanical energy, under the form of
apparent changes in gravitational potential energy resulting from changes in
density by diabatic and adiabatic effects. From the knowledge of $\delta
W_{ba}$, the corresponding approximation to the ""heat"" $\delta Q_{ba}$ can be
constructed in a consistent way by requiring that the Maxwell relationships be
satisfied, ultimately leading to the construction of a well defined
approximation to the internal energy and ultimately of the full range of known
thermodynamic potentials. These properties make it possible to endow common
forms of the Boussinesq and anelastic approximations with fully consistent
energetics and thermodynamics, even when diabatic effects and an arbitrary
nonlinear equation of state for a binary fluid are retained, without loss of
accuracy. In that case, it can be shown that the sum of kinetic energy and
enthalpy is a conservative quantity, which plays the role of the total energy
in the Boussinesq and anelastic approximations for both diabatic and adiabatic
motions. This implies that gravitational potential energy can be regarded as
the difference between enthalpy and internal energy, and hence as a pure
thermodynamic property of the fluid.
  The results have implications for our understanding of turbulent mixing in
stratified fluids, as well as for correcting the energetics of current
numerical ocean general circulation models, which are discussed.

the group velocity, as well as the energy flow velocity. If further we define
the signal velocity $v_s$ as the front velocity, there always exists a mode
with $v_s>1$, hence causality is violated classically. Thus our method might be
useful in the analysis of Lorentz violation in QED in terms of classical
causality .

black holes in quiescent galaxies. However, in previous work the presence of a
dark matter halo has been ignored in the modeling. Gebhardt & Thomas (2009)
showed that accounting for a dark matter halo increased the black hole mass of
the massive galaxy M87 by a factor of two. We used a sample of 12 galaxies to
investigate the effect of accounting for a dark matter halo in the dynamical
modeling in more detail, and also updated the masses using improved modeling.
The sample of galaxies possesses Hubble Space Telescope and ground based
observations of stellar kinematics. Their black hole masses have been presented
before, but without including a dark matter halo in the models. Without a dark
halo, we find a mean increase in the estimated mass of 1.5 for the whole sample
compared to previous results. We attribute this change to using a more complete
orbit library. When we include a dark matter halo, along with the updated
models, we find an additional increase in black hole mass by a factor of 1.2 in
the mean, much less than for M87. We attribute the smaller discrepancy in black
hole mass to using data that better resolves the black hole's sphere of
influence. We redetermined the M-sigma and M-L relationships using our updated
black hole masses and found a slight increase in both normalization and
intrinsic scatter.

alignments (MSAs) and heavily depends on the validity of this information

quickly. Alignment-free methods, on the other hand, are based on abstract
string comparisons and avoid potential alignment problems. However, in general
they are not biologically motivated and ignore our knowledge about the
evolution of sequences. Thus, it is still a major open question how to define
an evolutionary distance metric between divergent sequences that makes use of
indel information and known substitution models without the need for a multiple
alignment. Here we propose a new evolutionary distance metric to close this
gap. It uses finite-state transducers to create a biologically motivated
similarity score which models substitutions and indels, and does not depend on
a multiple sequence alignment. The sequence similarity score is defined in
analogy to pairwise alignments and additionally has the positive semi-definite
property. We describe its derivation and show in simulation studies and
real-world examples that it is more accurate in reconstructing phylogenies than
competing methods. The result is a new and accurate way of determining
evolutionary distances in and beyond the twilight zone of sequence alignments

The integrated E1 strength in the energy region of the pygmy resonance grows
with the neutron number. The influence of deformation on the integrated
strength near the particle emission thresholds (which is of a keen
astrophysical interest) is strictly suppressed by the mutual compensation
effect for the branches of the giant dipole resonance. The results obtained are
in a good agreement with the previous findings of the relativistic mean field
model.

that the growth of gyration radius is slow versus time except the very early

underlying mechanism leading to such a possibly steady value has not been well
understood. In this Letter, we propose a simplified human mobility model to
simulate individual's daily travel with three sequential activities: commuting
to workplace, going to do leisure activities and returning home. With the
assumption that individual has constant travel speed and inferior limit of time
at home and work, we prove that the daily moving area of an individual is an
ellipse, and finally get an exact solution of the gyration radius. The
analytical solution well captures the empirical observation reported in [M. C.
Gonz`alez et al., Nature, 453 (2008) 779]. We also find that, in spite of the
heterogeneous displacement distribution in the population level, individuals in
our model have characteristic displacements, indicating a completely different

minimization increases the time that networks' nodes work properly without

is data transmission rate which is usually quantified by a network utility
function. There exists an inherent tradeoff between these criteria and
enhancing one of them can deteriorate the other one. In this paper, we consider
both Network Utility Maximization (NUM) and energy minimization in a

performance of the MAC and define utility as a monotonically increasing
function of link throughputs. We investigate the optimal tradeoff between
energy and utility in this part. In the second part, we define utility as a
function of end to end rates and optimize MAC and transport layers
simultaneously. We calculate optimal persistence probabilities and end-to-end
rates. Finally, by means of duality theorem, we decompose the problem into
smaller subproblems, which are solved at node and network layers separately.

this chiral Lagrangian we obtain an analytical expression for the spectral

well-studied for synchronous updates and is thus a reasonable choice to begin

Individuals thus adopt the strategies of better performing players in the hope
of successful reproduction. In structured populations the array of those that
are eligible to act as strategy sources is bounded to the immediate neighbors
of each individual. But which one of these strategy sources should potentially
be copied? Previous research dealt with this question either by selecting the
fittest or by selecting one player uniformly at random. Here we introduce a
parameter $u$ that interpolates between these two extreme options. Setting $u$
equal to zero returns the random selection of the opponent, while positive $u$
favor the fitter players. In addition, we divide the population into two
groups. Players from group $A$ select their opponents as dictated by the
parameter $u$, while players from group $B$ do so randomly irrespective of $u$.
We denote the fraction of players contained in groups $A$ and $B$ by $v$ and
$1-v$, respectively. The two parameters $u$ and $v$ allow us to analyze in
detail how aspirations in the context of the prisoner's dilemma game influence
the evolution of cooperation. We find that for sufficiently positive values of
$u$ there exist a robust intermediate $v \approx 0.5$ for which cooperation
thrives best. The robustness of this observation is tested against different
levels of uncertainty in the strategy adoption process $K$ and for different
interaction networks. We also provide complete phase diagrams depicting the
dependence of the impact of $u$ and $v$ for different values of $K$, and
contrast the validity of our conclusions by means of an alternative model where
individual aspiration levels are subject to evolution as well. Our study
indicates that heterogeneity in aspirations may be key for the sustainability

considered. We use the formalism introduced by \cite{DUD03} to cover a large
variety of cross-validation procedures including leave-one-out
cross-validation, $k$-fold cross-validation, hold-out cross-validation (or
split sample), and the leave-$\upsilon$-out cross-validation.
  In particular, we give a simple rule on how to choose the cross-validation,
depending on the stability of the class of predictors. In the special case of
uniform stability, an interesting consequence is that the number of elements in
the test set is not required to grow to infinity for the consistency of the
cross-validation procedure. In this special case, the particular interest of
leave-one-out cross-validation is emphasized.

behavior of granular media. It has been observed in computer simulations that
imposing a torque at the contacts modifies the force chains, making support
chains less important. In this work we investigate the effect of a gradual
hindering of the grains rotations on the so-called critical state of soil
mechanics. The critical state is an asymptotic state independent of the initial
solid fraction where deformations occur at a constant shear strength and
compactness. We quantify the difficulty to rotate by a friction coefficient at
the level of particles, acting like a threshold. We explore the effect of this
particle-level friction coefficient on the critical state by means of molecular
dynamics simulations of a simple shear test on a poly-disperse sphere packing.
We found that the larger the difficulty to rotate, the larger the final shear
strength of the sample. Other micro-mechanical variables, like the structural
anisotropy and the distribution of forces, are also influenced by the
threshold. These results reveal the key role of rotations on the critical
behavior of soils and suggest the inclusion of rotational variables into their
constitutive equations.

single-temperature synthetic spectrum based on LTE atmosphere models and a
newly constructed UV line list. If Vega were a normal, equator-on,
slow-rotating star, then its spectrum and our analysis would indicate a
temperature of Teff ~ 9550 K, surface gravity of log g ~ 3.7, general surface
metallicity of [m/H] ~ -0.5, and a microturbulence velocity of v(turb) ~ 2.0
km/s. Given its rapid rotation and nearly pole-on orientation, however, these
parameters must be regarded as representing averages across the observed
hemisphere. Modeling the complex UV line spectrum has allowed us to determine
the specific surface abundances for 17 different chemical elements, including
CNO, the light metals, and the iron group elements. The resultant abundance
pattern agrees in general with previous results, although there is considerable
scatter in the literature. Despite its peculiarities, Vega has turned out to
provide a powerful test of the extent of our abilities to model the atmospheric

thermodynamic equilibrium with vapor phase all over the system, i.e., the
solute concentration equals the solubility. When temperature and/or pressure
gradients are applied, diffusion fluxes appear and these fluxes are faithfully
determined by the temperature and pressure fields, not by the local solute
concentration, which is enslaved by the former. We derive the equations
governing such systems, accounting for thermodiffusion and gravitational
segregation effects which are shown not to be neglected for geological
systems---marine sediments, terrestrial aquifers, etc. The results are applied
for the treatment of non-high-pressure systems and real geological systems

  Section of the American Physical Society at Illinois Institute of Technology
  on November 19 2010",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Independent studies by different authors have proposed that classicality may
be induced in quantum objects by cosmological constraints presented by an
expanding universe of finite extent in space-time. Cosmological effects on a
quantum system can be explored in one approach by considering an object at rest
in space with a universal Hubble expansion taking place away from it, and
developing a Schroedinger type governing differential equation incorporating an
intrinsic expansion speed. Wave function solutions to this governing equation
exhibit pronounced central localization. The extent of concentration of
probability depends on mass; objects with small masses tend to behave in a
delocalized manner as ordinary quantum objects do in a static space, while
quantum objects with large masses are concentrated into much smaller regions.
To develop a criterion for classicality, we consider that if the size of the
localized region of concentrated probability density is larger than the size of
the corresponding extended object, then quantum behavior could be expected;
whereas if the region of high probability density for the location of the
center of mass is smaller than the size of the object, the object would behave
in a more classical manner. The resultant size threshold for classicality
accords with results of other studies examining these issues based on
uncertainty relations and wave packets. This size threshold is informative for
the case of compact extended objects and, as the constraint applies to the
center of mass of the system, does not lead to inconsistencies for quantum
correlations between distant entangled quantum objects. While local decoherence
may lead to classicality under a variety of conditions, cosmologically induced
classicality would appear to cause fundamental limitations on quantum behavior
in our universe.

To be published in the Journal of Scholarly Publishing",,,,"cs.OH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Today's peer review process for scientific articles is unnecessarily opaque
and offers few incentives to referees. Likewise, the publishing process is
unnecessarily inefficient and its results are only rarely made freely available
to the public. Here we outline a comparatively simple extension of arXiv.org,
an online preprint archive widely used in the mathematical and physical
sciences, that addresses both of these problems. Under the proposal, editors
invite referees to write public and signed reviews to be attached to the posted
preprints, and then elevate selected articles to ""published"" status.
