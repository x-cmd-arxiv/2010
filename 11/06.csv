of two atoms in an optical cavity. Starting from an arbitrary initial state, a
singlet state is prepared as the unique fixed point of a dissipative quantum
dynamical process. In our scheme, cavity decay is no longer undesirable, but
plays an integral part in the dynamics. As a result, we get a qualitative
improvement in the scaling of the fidelity with the cavity parameters. Our
analysis indicates that dissipative state preparation is more than just a new
conceptual approach, but can allow for significant improvement as compared to
preparation protocols based on coherent unitary dynamics.

gravitational collapse of the individual fragments, how is it possible to form
fragments massive enough for O and B stars in a typical star-forming molecular
cloud where the Jeans mass is about 1Msun at the typical densities (10^4 cm^-3)
and temperatures (10K)? We test the hypothesis that a first generation of
low-mass stars may heat the gas enough that subsequent thermal fragmentation
results in fragments >=10Msun, sufficient to form B stars. We combine ATCA and
SMA observations of the massive star-forming region G8.68-0.37 with radiative
transfer modeling to derive the present-day conditions in the region and use
this to infer the conditions in the past, at the time of core formation.
Assuming the current mass/separation of the observed cores equals the
fragmentation Jeans mass/length and the region's average density has not
changed, requires the gas temperature to have been 100K at the time of
fragmentation. The postulated first-generation of low-mass stars would still be
around today, but the number required to heat the cloud exceeds the limits
imposed by the observations. Several lines of evidence suggest the observed
cores in the region should eventually form O stars yet none have sufficient raw
material. Even if feedback may have suppressed fragmentation, it was not
sufficient to halt it to this extent. To develop into O stars, the cores must
obtain additional mass from outside their observationally defined boundaries.
The observations suggest they are currently fed via infall from the very
massive reservoir (~1500Msun) of gas in the larger pc scale cloud around the
star-forming cores. This suggests that massive stars do not form in the
collapse of individual massive fragments, but rather in smaller fragments that
themselves continue to gain mass by accretion from larger scales.

taking a dominating substrate contribution as well as the measurement geometry

through the substrate can be reduced for the p-type epi-layers, as a

inverse temperature, we show that the maximum time spent at points jumps
discontinuously from 0 to a positive fraction of the number of monomers, in the

that a large fraction of its monomers live on four adjacent positions, and its

and we define a new figure of merit that may be helpful for magnet design - the
OADI (Off-Axis Double Ic), which clearly shows that BZO broadens the ab-plane
peak and thus raises Jc 5-30{\deg} away from the tape plane, where the most
critical approach to Ic occurs in many coil designs. We describe some
experimental procedures that may make critical current Ic tests of these very
high current tapes more tractable at 4.2 K, where Ic exceeds 1000 A even for 4
mm wide tape with only 1 micron thickness of superconductor. A positive
conclusion is that BZO is very beneficial for the Jc characteristics at 4.2 K,
just as it is at higher temperatures, where the correlated c-axis pinning
effects of the nanorods are much more obvious.

to infer the presence of additional planets. Deducing the masses and orbital
parameters of such planets from transit time variations (TTVs) alone is a rich
and increasingly relevant dynamical problem. In this work, we evaluate the
extent of the degeneracies in this process, systematically explore the
dependence of TTV signals on several parameters and provide phase space plots
that could aid observers in planning future observations. Our explorations are
focused on a likely-to-be prevalent situation: a known transiting short-period
Neptune or Jupiter-sized planet and a suspected external low-mass perturber on
a nearly-coplanar orbit. Through approximately 10^7 N-body simulations, we
demonstrate how TTV signal amplitudes may vary by orders of magnitude due to
slight variations in any one orbital parameter (0.001 AU in semimajor axis,
0.005 in eccentricity, or a few degrees in orbital angles), and quantify the
number of consecutive transit observations necessary in order to obtain a
reasonable opportunity to characterize the unseen planet (approximately greater
or equal to 50 observations). Planets in or near period commensurabilities of
the form p:q, where p < 21 and q < 4, produce distinct TTV signatures,
regardless of whether the planets are actually locked in a mean motion
resonance. We distinguish these systems from the secular systems in our
explorations. Additionally, we find that computing the autocorrelation function
of a TTV signal can provide a useful diagnostic for identifying possible orbits
for additional planets and suggest that this method could aid integration of
TTV signals in future studies of particular exosystems.

been generalized for quantum Hamiltonians. However, the underlying Markov chain
of this algorithm is still classical in nature. Due to Szegedy's method, the
Markov chains of classical Hamiltonians can achieve a quadratic quantum speedup
in the eigenvalue gap of the corresponding transition matrix. A natural
question to ask is whether Szegedy's quantum speedup is merely a consequence of
employing classical Hamiltonians, where the eigenstates simply coincide with
the computational basis, making cloning of the classical information possible.
We solve this problem by introducing a quantum version of the method of
Markov-chain quantization combined with the quantum simulated annealing (QSA)

exhibits a quadratic quantum speedup in the eigenvalue gap of the corresponding

Recently, a general framework was proposed to generate all neutrality tests
that are linear functions of the frequency spectrum. In this framework, a
family of optimal tests was developed to have almost maximum power against a
specific alternative evolutionary scenario. Following these developments, in
this paper we provide a thorough discussion of linear and nonlinear neutrality
tests. First, we present the general framework for linear tests and emphasize
the importance of the property of scalability with the sample size (that is,
the results of the tests should not depend on the sample size), which, if
missing, can guide to errors in data interpretation. The motivation and
structure of linear optimal tests are discussed. In a further generalization,
we develop a general framework for nonlinear neutrality tests and we derive
nonlinear optimal tests for polynomials of any degree in the frequency

integral of the imaginary part of the pion form factor in the timelike region.
This formulation incorporates information from e+e- annihilation experiments
and allows one to reconstruct the transverse density much more accurately than
from the spacelike pion form factor data alone. We calculate the transverse
density using an empirical parametrization of the timelike pion form factor and
estimate that it is determined to an accuracy of ~10% at a distance b ~ 0.1 fm,
and significantly better at larger distances. The density is found to be close
to that obtained from a zero-width rho meson pole over a wide range and shows a
pronounced rise at small distances. The resulting two-dimensional image of the
fast-moving pion can be interpreted in terms of its partonic structure in QCD.
We argue that the singular behavior of the charge density at the center
requires a substantial presence of pointlike configurations in the pion's
partonic wave function, which can be probed in other high-momentum transfer
processes.

their quadratic covariation and a generalization thereof. He then obtained a
systematic differentiation theory containing a fundamental theorem of
stochastic calculus relating this derivative to It\^o's integral, a
differential stochastic chain rule, a differential stochastic mean value
theorem, and other differentiation rules. Here, we use this differentiation
theory to obtain variants of the Clark-Ocone and Stroock formulas, with and
without change of measure. We prove our variants of the Clark-Ocone formula
under $L^{2}$-type conditions; with no Malliavin calculus, without the use of
weak distributional or Radon-Nikodym type derivatives, and without the
significant machinery of the Hida-Malliavin calculus. Unlike Malliavin or
Hida-Malliavin calculi, the form of our variant of the Clark-Ocone formula
under change of measure is as simple as it is under no change of measure, and
without requiring any further differentiability conditions on the Girsanov
transform integrand beyond Novikov's condition. This is due to the invariance
under change of measure of the first author's derivative in \cite{A1}. The
formulations and proofs are natural applications of the differentiation theory
in \cite{A1} and standard It\^o integral calculus. Iterating our Clark-Ocone
formula, we obtain variants of Stroock's formula. We illustrate the
applicability of these formulas by easily, and without Hida-Malliavin methods,
obtaining the representation of the Brownian indicator

and performs tomographic cosmic shear analysis using line-of-sight integration
through these simulations while saving the particle lightcone information.
Galaxy shear and convergence catalogues with realistic 3D galaxy redshift
distributions are produced for the purposes of testing weak lensing analysis
techniques and generating covariance matrices for data analysis and
cosmological parameter estimation. We present a suite of fast medium resolution
simulations with shear and convergence maps for a generic 100 square degree
survey out to a redshift of z = 1.5, with angular power spectra agreeing with
the theory to better than a few percent accuracy up to l = 10^3 for all source
redshifts up to z = 1.5 and wavenumbers up to l = 2000 for the source redshifts
z > 1.1. At higher wavenumbers, there is a failure of the theoretical lensing
power spectrum reflecting the known discrepancy of the Smith et al. (2003)
fitting formula at high physical wavenumbers. A two-parameter Gaussian
likelihood analysis of sigma_8 and Omega_m is also performed on the suite of
simulations, demonstrating that the cosmological parameters are recovered from
the simulations and the covariance matrices are stable for data analysis. We
find no significant bias in the parameter estimation at the level of ~ 0.02.
The SUNGLASS pipeline should be an invaluable tool in weak lensing analysis.

shown that the yields are suppressed in Au+Au collisions compared to
expectations from binary scaled p+p collisions. These measurements indicate
that charm and bottom quarks interact with the hot-dense matter produced in
heavy-ion collisions much more than expected. Here we extend these studies to
two-particle correlations where one particle is an electron from the decay of a
heavy-flavor meson and the other is a charged hadron from either the decay of
the heavy meson or from jet fragmentation. These measurements provide more
detailed information about the interactions between heavy quarks and the
matter, such as whether the modification of the away-side-jet shape seen in
hadron-hadron correlations is present when the trigger particle is from
heavy-meson decay and whether the overall level of away-side jet suppression is
consistent. We statistically subtract correlations of electrons arising from
background sources from the inclusive electron-hadron correlations and obtain
two-particle azimuthal correlations at sqrt(s_NN)=$200 GeV between electrons
from heavy-flavor decay with charged hadrons in p+p and also first results in
Au+Au collisions. We find the away-side-jet shape and yield to be modified in
Au+Au collisions compared to p+p collisions.

$\lambda_{E}$ is the de Broglie wavelength. We develop a regular approach to
anomalous statistics of normalized eigenfunctions $\psi(r)$ at such

transfer-matrix equation for a generating function $\Phi_{r}(u, \phi)$ ($u$ and
$\phi$ have a meaning of the squared amplitude and phase of eigenfunctions, $r$

function ${\cal P}_{r}(\phi)\equiv\Phi_{r}(u=0,\phi)$ is shown to be the
distribution function of phase which determines the Lyapunov exponent and the
local density of states.
  In the leading order in the small disorder we have derived a second-order
partial differential equation for the $r$-independent (""zero-mode"") component
$\Phi(u, \phi)$ at the $E=0$ ($f=\frac{1}{2}$) anomaly. This equation is
nonseparable in variables $u$ and $\phi$. Yet, we show that due to a hidden

$I_{m}=N<|\psi|^{2m}>$ ($m\geq 1$) for a chain of the length $N \rightarrow

as they drift inward. This paper studies the convergent migration of giant

they are captured into mean motion resonance. The probability that such planets
enter resonance depends on the type of resonance, the migration rate, the
eccentricity damping rate, and the amplitude of the turbulent fluctuations.
This problem is studied both through direct integrations of the full 3-body
problem, and via semi-analytic model equations. In general, the probability of
resonance decreases with increasing migration rate, and with increasing levels
of turbulence, but increases with eccentricity damping. Previous work has shown
that the distributions of orbital elements (eccentricity and semimajor axis)
for observed extrasolar planets can be reproduced by migration models with
multiple planets. However, these results depend on resonance locking, and this
study shows that entry into -- and maintenance of -- mean motion resonance
depends sensitively on migration rate, eccentricity damping, and turbulence.

received a substantial level of attention over the past two decades, both from
experimental and theoretical points of view. Nevertheless, many industrial
fluids and consumer products are non-Newtonian, and their rheological
properties affect their flow behavior. The present work aims at studying the
dynamics of cylindrical jets of a viscoelastic, shear-thinning solution of
cetylpyridinium salt (CPyCl). In concentrated solutions, CPyCl surfactant
molecules have been shown to assemble in long wormlike micellar structures,
which gives the fluid its non-Newtonian properties. Jets of this fluid show
novel features compared to their Newtonian counterparts, including a type of
motion, in which the jet folds back and forth on itself in a fashion similar to
sheets of viscous fluids, instead of coiling around the vertical axis as
cylindrical Newtonian jets do. Another novel feature of CPyCl micellar fluid
jets is a widening of the jet above the plate reminiscent of the die-swell
phenomenon that we call \emph{reverse swell}. We propose physical mechanisms
for both folding and reverse swell, and compare theoretical predictions to
experimental measurements. In addition, we systematically explore different
flow regimes in the parameter space of the height of fall and flow rate and
compare regime maps of a CPyCl micellar solution and a Newtonian silicone oil.

spectra and appear to be in a post-starburst or post-quenched phase, if not for
their [OII] emission. Examining the flux ratio of the [NII] to Halpha lines, we
find that in five of the six hosts the dominant source of ionizing flux is AGN
continuum emission. Furthermore, we find that four of the six galaxies have
over twice the [OII] line luminosity that could be generated by star formation
processes alone given their Halpha line luminosities. This strongly suggests
that AGN-excited narrow-line emission is contaminating the [OII] line flux. A
comparison of star formation rates calculated from extinction-corrected [OII]
and Halpha line luminosities indicates that the former yields a five-fold
overestimate of current activity in these galaxies. Our findings reveal the
[OII] line to be a poor indicator of star formation activity in a majority of
these moderate-luminosity Seyferts. This result bolsters our previous findings
that an increased fraction of AGN at high redshifts are hosted by galaxies in a
post-starburst phase. The relatively high fraction of AGN hosts in the Cl1604
supercluster that show signs of recently truncated star formation activity
suggest AGN feedback may play an increasingly important role in suppressing
ongoing activity in large-scale structures at high redshift.

Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the physics of potential
angular momentum transport processes - including self-gravity,
magnetorotational instability, baroclinic instabilities, and magnetic braking -
and in developing testable models for disk dispersal via photoevaporation. The
relative importance of these processes depends upon the initial mass, size and
magnetization of the disk, and subsequently on its opacity, ionization state,
and external irradiation. Disk dynamics is therefore coupled to star formation,
pre-main-sequence stellar evolution, and dust coagulation during the early
stages of planet formation, and may vary dramatically from star to star. The
importance of validating theoretical models is emphasized, with the key
observations being those that probe disk structure on the scales, between 1 AU
and 10 AU, where theory is most uncertain.

While many of our E/S0s fall on the same Schmidt-Kennicutt relation as local
spirals, ~80% (predominantly on the blue sequence) are offset towards
apparently higher molecular-gas star formation efficiency (i.e., shorter
molecular gas depletion time). Possible interpretations of the elevated
efficiencies include bursty star formation similar to that in local dwarf
galaxies, H2 depletion in advanced starbursts, or simply a failure of the
CO(1-0) emission to trace all of the molecular gas.

large-scale clustering of haloes of a given mass does not vary significantly
with the assembly history. The peak height, usually taken to be well
represented by the virial mass, can instead be approximated by the mass inside
spheres of different radii, which in some cases can be larger than the virial
radius and therefore include mass outside the individual host halo. The sphere
radii are defined as r = $a$ delta_t + $b$ log_10(M_vir/M_nl), where delta_t is
the age relative to the typical age of galaxies hosted by haloes with virial
mass M_vir, M_nl is the non-linear mass, and $a$=0.2 and $b$=-0.02 are the free
parameters adjusted to trace the assembly bias effect. Note that $r$ depends on
both halo mass and age. In this new approach, some of the objects which were
initially considered low-mass peaks belong to regions with higher
overdensities. At large scales, i.e. in the two-halo regime, this model
properly recovers the simple prescription where the bias responds to the height
of the mass peak alone, in contrast to the usual definition (virial mass) that
shows a strong dependence on additional halo properties such as formation time.
The dependence on the age in the one-halo term is also remarkably reduced. The
population of galaxies whose ""peak height"" changes with this new definition
consists mainly of old stellar populations and are preferentially hosted by
low-mass haloes located near more massive objects. The latter is in agreement
with recent results which indicate that old, low-mass haloes would suffer
truncation of mass accretion by nearby larger haloes or simply due to the high
density of their surroundings, thus showing an assembly bias effect. The change
in mass is small enough that the Sheth et al. (2001) mass function is still a
good fit to the resulting distribution of new masses.

is that the requirement of a suitably flat scalar potential is sensitive to
Ultra-Violet (UV) physics. Axions are among the best-motivated inflaton
candidates, since the flatness of their potential is naturally protected by a
shift symmetry. We re-consider the cosmological perturbations in axion
inflation, consistently accounting for the coupling to gauge fields \phi F
\tilde{F}, which is generically present in these models. This coupling leads to
production of gauge quanta, which provide a new source of inflaton
fluctuations, \delta\phi. For an axion decay constant < 10^{-2} M_p, this
effect typically dominates over the standard fluctuations from the vacuum, and
saturates the current observational bounds on nongaussianity of the CMB
anisotropies. Since sub-Planckian values of the decay constant are typical for
concrete realizations that admit a UV completion (such as N-flation and axion
monodromy), we conclude that large nongaussianity is easily obtained in very
minimal and natural realizations of inflation.

The strength of the rest-frame optical emission lines in the F160W bandpass

the galaxies. The sizes and structural parameters in the rest-frame optical
continuum and Halpha emission reveal no significant differences, suggesting
similar global distributions of the on-going star formation and more evolved
stellar population. While no strong correlations are observed between stellar
population parameters and morphology within the NIC2/SINFONI sample itself, a
consideration of the sample in the context of a broader range of z~2 galaxy
types indicates that these galaxies probe the high specific star formation rate
and low stellar mass surface density part of the massive z~2 galaxy population,
with correspondingly large effective radii, low Sersic indices, low G, and high

dependence on scale, shape and the non-Gaussianity parameter fNL. We compute
the terms based on a multivariate bias expansion and the peak-background split
method and show that non-Gaussian modifications to the bias parameters lead to
amplifications of the tree level bispectrum that were ignored in previous
studies. Our results are in a good agreement with published simulation
measurements of the halo bispectrum. Finally, we estimate the expected signal
to noise on fNL and show that the constraint obtainable from the bispectrum
analysis significantly exceeds the one obtainable from the power spectrum
analysis.

Z\varnothing\oplus\mathcal{P},\divideontimes)$ is a commutative associative
threegraded ring of polynomials. The ring $\mathcal{RP}$ has the structure of a
graded Hopf algebra. It turns out that $\mathcal{P}$ has a natural Hopf
comodule structure over $\mathcal{RP}$. Faces operators $d_k$ that send a
polytope to the sum of all its $(n-k)$-dimensional faces define on both rings
the Hopf module structures over the universal Leibnitz-Hopf algebra
$\mathcal{Z}$. This structure gives a ring homomorphism $\R\to\Qs\otimes\R$,
where $\R$ is $\mathcal{P}$ or $\mathcal{RP}$. Composing this homomorphism with
the characters $P^n\to\alpha^n$ of $\mathcal{P}$, $P^n\to\alpha^{n+1}$ of
$\mathcal{RP}$, and with the counit we obtain the ring homomorphisms
$f\colon\mathcal{P}\to\Qs[\alpha]$,
$f_{\mathcal{RP}}\colon\mathcal{RP}\to\Qs[\alpha]$, and
$\F^*:\mathcal{RP}\to\Qs$, where $F$ is the Ehrenborg transformation. We
describe the images of these homomorphisms in terms of functional equations,
prove that these images are rings of polynomials over $\mathbb Q$, and find the
relations between the images, the homomorphisms and the Hopf comodule
structures. For each homomorphism $f,\;f_{\mathcal{RP}}$, and $\F$ the images
of two polytopes coincide if and only if they have equal flag $f$-vectors.
Therefore algebraic structures on the images give the information about flag
$f$-vectors of polytopes.

that the quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distribution (SED) of 3C 66A can be
well reproduced, especially its {\it Fermi}-LAT first 3 months average spectrum
can be well reproduced by the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) component plus
external Compton (EC) component of the broad line region (BLR). Clues on its
redshift and gamma-ray emission location are obtained. The results indicate the
following. (i) On the redshift; The theoretical intrinsic TeV spectra can be
predicted by extrapolating the reproduced GeV spectra. Through comparing this
extrapolated TeV spectra with the extragalactic background light (EBL)
corrected observed TeV spectra, it is suggested that the redshift of 3C 66A
could be between 0.1 and 0.3, the most likely value is $\sim$ 0.2. (ii) On the
gamma-ray emission location; To well reproduce the GeV emission of 3C 66A under
different assumptions on BLR, the gamma-ray emission region is always required
to be beyond the inner zone of BLR. The BLR absorption effect on gamma-ray
emission confirms this point.

  Social Networks",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent years have witnessed the explosion of online social networks (OSNs).
They provide powerful IT-innovations for online social activities such as
organizing contacts, publishing contents, and sharing interests between friends
who may never meet before. As more and more people become the active users of
online social networks, one may ponder questions such as: (1) Do OSNs indeed
improve our sociability? (2) To what extent can we expand our offline social
spectrum in OSNs? (3) Can we identify some interesting user behaviors in OSNs?
Our work in this paper just aims to answer these interesting questions. To this
end, we pay a revisit to the well-known Dunbar's number in online social
networks. Our main research contributions are as follows. First, to our best
knowledge, our work is the first one that systematically validates the
existence of the online Dunbar's number in the range of [200,300]. To reach
this, we combine using local-structure analysis and user-interaction analysis
for extensive real-world OSNs. Second, we divide OSNs users into two
categories: rational and aggressive, and find that rational users intend to
develop close and reciprocated relationships, whereas aggressive users have no
consistent behaviors. Third, we build a simple model to capture the constraints
of time and cognition that affect the evolution of online social networks.
Finally, we show the potential use of our findings in viral marketing and
privacy management in online social networks.

correlation field of the magnetoconductance fluctuations the phase-coherence
length l_phi is determined. At the lowest temperatures l_phi is found to be at
least 300 nm, while for temperatures exceeding 2 K a monotonous decrease of
l_phi with temperature is observed. A direct observation of the weak
antilocalization effect indicating the presence of spin-orbit coupling is
masked by the strong magnetoconductance fluctuations. However, by averaging the
magnetoconductance over a range of gate voltages a clear peak in the
magnetoconductance due to the weak antilocalization effect was resolved. By
comparison of the experimental data to simulations based on a recursive
two-dimensional Green's function approach a spin-orbit scattering length of
approximately 70 nm was extracted, indicating the presence of strong spin-orbit
coupling.

studying the relative velocity statistics of merging haloes in Lagrangian
perturbation theory. Given a cosmological background model, a power spectrum of
fluctuations as well as a Gaussian linear density contrast field $\delta_{\rm
l}$ is generated on a cubic grid, which is then smoothed repeatedly with
Gaussian filters. For each Lagrangian particle at position $\bmath{q}$ and each
smoothing radius $R$, the collapse time, the velocities and ellipsoidal
truncation are computed using Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. The collapsed
medium is then fragmented into isolated objects by an algorithm designed to
mimic the accretion and merger events of hierarchical collapse. Directly after
the fragmentation process the mass function, merger histories of haloes and the
statistics of the relative velocities at merging are evaluated. We
reimplemented the algorithm in C++, recovered the mass function and optimised
the construction of halo merging histories. Comparing our results with the
output of the Millennium simulation suggests that PINOCCHIO is well suited for
studying relative velocities of merging haloes and is able to reproduce the
pairwise velocity distribution.

rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke. The system answers the following
challenges: (i) increase motivation of patients by making the training a
personalized experience; (ii) take into account patients' impairments by
offering intuitive and easy to use interaction modalities; (iii) make it
possible to therapists to track patient's activities and to evaluate/track
their progress; (iv) open opportunities for telemedicine and tele
rehabilitation; (v) and provide an economically acceptable system by reducing
both equipment and management costs. In order to test this system a pilot study
has been conducted in conjunction with a French hospital in order to understand
the potential and benefits of mixed reality. The pilot involved 3 therapists
who 'played the role' of patients. Three sessions, one using conventional
rehabilitation, another using an ad hoc developed game on a PC, and another
using a mixed reality version of the same game were held. Results have shown
the MRS and the PC game to be accepted more than physical rehabilitation.

Majda's model with Arrhenius-type ignition function, a simplified model for
reacting flow, as heat release and activation energy are varied. Our purpose
is, first, to answer a question of Majda whether oscillatory instabilities can
occur for high activation energies as in the full reacting Euler equations,
and, second, to test the efficiency of various versions of a numerical
eigenvalue-finding scheme suggested by Humpherys and Zumbrun against the
standard method of Lee and Stewart. Our results suggest that instabilities do
not occur for Majda's model with Arrhenius-type ignition function, nor with a
modified Arrhenius-type ignition function suggested by Lyng--Zumbrun, even in
the high-activation energy limit. We find that the algorithm of
Humpherys--Zumbrun is in the context of Majda's model $100$-$1,000$ times
faster than the one described in the classical work of Lee and Stewart and
$1$-$10$ times faster than an optimized version of the Lee--Stewart algorithm
using an adaptive-mesh ODE solver

in different examples of network topologies that when the degree distribution

implying an equivalence between a quantum and a classical description of
