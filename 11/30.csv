19244, 2009) and temporal phase modulation (Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 163601, 2009)
of paired photons is generally attributed to the presence of frequency
entanglement between two frequency anticorrelated photons. In this paper, it is
shown that by introducing the appropriate amount of chromatic dispersion or
phase modulation between non-entangled photons, it is also possible to observe
these effects. Indeed, it is found that the relevant characteristic for the
observation of dispersion cancelation or the cancelation of temporal phase
modulation is the presence of certain frequency correlations between the
photons.

Local Supercluster and its surroundings. The groups and their associations are
identified among 10914 galaxies at |b|>15deg with radial velocities VLG<3500

inside their zero-velocity surface. Hereby, we assume that individual galaxy
masses are proportional to their total K-band luminosities, M/L_K=6 Msun/Lsun.
  The sample of our groups, where each group has n>=4 members, is characterized
by the following medians: mean projected radius <R>=268 kpc, radial velocity
dispersion sigma_V=74 km/s, K-band luminosity L_K=1.2x10^11 Lsun, virial and
projected masses Mvir=2.4x10^12 and Mp=3.3x10^12 Msun, respectively. Accounting
for measurement error reduces the median masses by 30 per cent. For 97 per cent
of identified groups the crossing time does not exceed the cosmic time, 13.7
Gyr, having the median at 3.8 Gyr.
  We examine different properties of the groups, in particular, of the known
nearby groups and clusters in Virgo and Fornax. About a quarter of our groups
can be classified as fossil groups where the dominant galaxy is at least ten
times brighter than the other group members.
  In total, our algorithm identifies 54 per cent of galaxies to be members of
groups. Together with triple systems and pairs they gather 82 per cent of the
K-band light in Local universe. We have obtained the local value of matter
density to be Omega_m=0.08+-0.02 within a distance of ~40 Mpc assuming H0=73
km/s/Mpc. It is significantly smaller than the cosmic value, 0.28, in the
standard lambdaCDM model. The discrepancy between the global and local
quantities of Omega_m may be caused by the existence of Dark Matter component
unrelated to the virial masses of galaxy systems.

prices? Or do they in fact make things worse? Just like medicine regulatory
measures in financial markets aim at improving an already complex system. And
just like medicine these interventions can cause side effects which are even
harder to assess when taking the interplay with other measures into account. In
this paper an agent based stock market model is built that tries to find
answers to the questions above. In a stepwise procedure regulatory measures are
introduced and their implications on market liquidity and stability examined.
Particularly, the effects of (i) a ban of short selling (ii) a mandatory risk
limit, i.e. a Value-at-Risk limit, (iii) an introduction of a Tobin Tax, i.e.
transaction tax on trading, and (iv) any arbitrary combination of the measures
are observed and discussed. The model is set up to incorporate non-linear
feedback effects of leverage and liquidity constraints leading to fire sales
and escape dynamics. In its unregulated version the model outcome is capable of
reproducing stylised facts of asset returns like fat tails and clustered
volatility. Introducing regulatory measures shows that only a mandatory risk
limit is beneficial from every perspective, while a short selling ban - though
reducing volatility - increases tail risk. The contrary holds true for a Tobin
Tax: it reduces the occurrence of crashes but increases volatility.
Furthermore, the interplay of measures is not negligible: measures block each
other and a well chosen combination can mitigate unforeseen side effects.
Concerning the Tobin Tax the findings indicate that an overdose can do severe
harm.

Our method is based on the introduction of U(1)-symmetric classical-field

rigorously quantify the anomalous and non-Gaussian character of the field
fluctuations. We compare our results for anomalous correlation functions with

classical-field dynamics incorporate a full description of many-body processes
which modify the effective mean-field potentials experienced by condensate and
noncondensate atoms. We discuss the role of these processes in shaping the
condensate mode, and thereby demonstrate the consistency of the Penrose-Onsager
definition of the condensate orbital in the classical-field equilibrium. We
consider the contribution of various noncondensate-field correlations to the
overall suppression of density fluctuations and interactions in the field, and
demonstrate the distinct roles of phase and density fluctuations in the

a detailed study of the infall region: the SNe Ia falling away from the Local
Group towards Shapley are indeed significantly dimmer than those falling
towards us and on to Shapley. Convergence to the CMB rest frame must occur well
beyond Shapley (z>0.06) so the low redshift bulk flow can systematically bias
any reconstruction of the expansion history of the Universe. At high redshifts

aim of this work is to compare the properties of the nonlinear final equilibria
with those found in a system with Cartesian geometry. Maps of the density and
magnetic field lines, when the strength of the gravitational field is constant,
are given in both geometries. In the axisymmetric model, the magnetic field
tends to expand in radius, forming magnetic arcades, while knots of gas are
formed because the plasma drains radially and strangulates the magnetic field
lines, leading to the formation of magnetic bottlenecks. We find that the
magnetic buoyancy and the drainage of gas along field lines are less efficient
under axial symmetry than in a Cartesian atmosphere. As a consequence, the
column density enhancement arising in gas condensations in the
axially-symmetric model is smaller than in Cartesian geometry. The
magnetic-to-gas pressure ratio in the final state takes more extreme values in
the Cartesian model. Models with non-uniform radial gravity are also discussed.

resolving power above 20400 at photon energy of 930 eV (Cu L-edge). With this
energy taken as reference, the VLS coefficients are optimized to cancel the
lineshape asymmetry (mostly from the coma aberrations) as well as minimize the
symmetric aberration broadening at large grating illuminations, dramatically
increasing the aberration-limited vertical acceptance of the spectrometer. For
any energy away from the reference, we evaluate corrections to the entrance arm
and light incidence angle on the grating to maintain the exactly symmetric
lineshape. Furthermore, we evaluate operational modes when these corrections
are coordinated to maintain either energy independent focal curve inclination
or maximal aberration-limited spectrometer acceptance. The results are
supported by analytical evaluation of the coma term of the optical path

chemical evolution have largely been based on stellar spectroscopy. However,
the recent detection of these elements in several planetary nebulae (PNe)
indicates that nebular spectroscopy is a promising new tool for such studies.
In PNe, n-capture element abundance determinations reveal details of s-process
nucleosynthesis and convective mixing in evolved low-mass stars, as well as the
chemical evolution of elements that cannot be detected in stellar spectra. Only
one or two ions of a given trans-iron element can typically be detected in
individual nebulae. Elemental abundance determinations thus require corrections
for the abundances of unobserved ions. Such corrections rely on the
availability of atomic data for processes that control the ionization
equilibrium of nebulae. Until recently, these data were unknown for virtually
all n-capture element ions. For the first five ions of Se, Kr, and Xe -- the
three most widely detected n-capture elements in PNe -- we are calculating
photoionization cross sections and radiative and dielectronic recombination
rate coefficients using the multi-configuration Breit-Pauli atomic structure
code AUTOSTRUCTURE. Charge transfer rate coefficients are being determined with
a multichannel Landau-Zener code. To calibrate these calculations, we have
measured absolute photoionization cross sections of Se and Xe ions at the
Advanced Light Source synchrotron radiation facility. These atomic data can be
incorporated into photoionization codes, which we will use to derive ionization
corrections (hence abundances) for Se, Kr, and Xe in ionized nebulae. These
results are critical for honing nebular spectroscopy into a more effective tool
for investigating the production and chemical evolution of trans-iron elements
in the Universe.

the square to oblique polygon ($N_V =4$); the triangle to oblique ($N_V =6$)
transitions; and finally the 3D cubic to tetragonal transition ($ N_V =3$). The
local meanfield solutions in 2D and 3D yield oriented domain-walls patterns as
from continuous-variable strain dynamics, showing the discrete-variable models
capture the essential ferroelastic texturings. Other related hamiltonians
illustrate that structural-transitions in materials science can be the source
of interesting spin models in statistical mechanics.

a new electroweak penguin amplitude. Motivated by this result, we analyse the
purely isospin-violating decays B_s --> phi rho^0 and B_s --> phi pi^0, which
are dominated by electroweak penguins, and show that in presence of a new
electroweak penguin amplitude their branching ratio can be enhanced by up to an
order of magnitude, without violating any constraints from other hadronic B
decays. This makes them very interesting modes for LHCb and future B factories.
We perform both a model-independent analysis and a study within realistic New
Physics models such as a modified-Z^0-penguin scenario, a model with an
additional Z' boson and the MSSM. In the latter cases the new amplitude can be
correlated with other flavour phenomena, such as semileptonic B decays and
B_s-Bbar_s mixing, which impose stringent constraints on the enhancement of the
two B_s decays. In particular we find that, contrary to claims in the
literature, electroweak penguins in the MSSM can reduce the discrepancy in the
B --> pi K modes only marginally. As byproducts we update the SM predictions to
Br(Bbar_s --> phi pi^0)=1.6^{+1.1}_{-0.3}*10^{-7} and Br(Bbar_s --> phi
rho^0)=4.4^{+2.7}_{-0.7}*10^{-7} and perform a state-of-the-art analysis of B

absolute rms amplitude and mean source flux over timescales shorter than ~ 3
ksec. A linear rms-flux relation has been observed to be a common property of
broad-band noise but here we report the first detection of rms-flux dependence
in a QPO. The gradient of the rms-flux relation is correlated with the QPO peak
frequency: from a strong positive correlation when the QPO peak frequency is
below ~ 4 Hz, through no correlation, to a strong negative correlation when the
peak frequency is above 6 Hz. This is the first time a negative short term
rms-flux relation has been observed in any component of the power spectrum.
Previous work on both the broad-band noise and QPOs in a range of sources have
suggested the presence of a filter reducing the amplitude of QPOs with
increasing frequency. We attempt to remove the possible effects of this filter

Following von Mises, we argue that probability can only be defined for events
that can be repeated in similar conditions, and that exhibit 'frequency
stabilization'. The central idea of the present article is that the mentioned
'conditions' should be well-defined and 'partitioned'. More precisely, we will
divide probabilistic systems into object, environment, and probing subsystem,
and show that such partitioning allows to solve a wide variety of classic
paradoxes of probability theory. As a corollary, we arrive at the surprising
conclusion that at least one central idea of the orthodox interpretation of
quantum mechanics is a direct consequence of the meaning of probability. More
precisely, the idea that the ""observer influences the quantum system"" is
obvious if one realizes that quantum systems are probabilistic systems; it
holds for all probabilistic systems, whether quantum or classical.

are convergent if the base field is the field of complex numbers, and whose

temperature with nonzero R-charge densities, and in Non-Commutative gauge
theory at finite temperature. The gluon scattering amplitude is defined as a
light-like Wilson loop which lives at the horizon of the T-dual black holes of
the backgrounds we consider. We study in detail a special amplitude, which
corresponds to forward scattering of a low energy gluon off a high energy one.
For this kinematic configuration in the considered backgrounds, we find the
corresponding minimal surface which is directly related to the gluon scattering
amplitude. We find that for increasing the chemical potential or the
non-commutative parameter, the on-shell action corresponding to our Wilson loop
in the T-dual space decreases. For all of our solutions the length of the short
side of the Wilson loop is constrained by an upper bound which depends on the
temperature, the R-charge density and the non-commutative parameter. Due to
this constraint, in the limit of zeroth temperature our approach breaks down
since the upper bound goes to zero, while by keeping the temperature finite and

observed high-energy gamma-ray signals from distant blazars may be dominated by
secondary gamma rays produced along the line of sight by the interactions of
cosmic-ray protons with background photons. This explains the surprisingly low
attenuation observed for distant blazars, because the production of secondary
gamma rays occurs, on average, much closer to Earth than the distance to the
source. Thus the observed spectrum in the TeV range does not depend on the
intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum, while it depends on the output of the source in
cosmic rays. We apply this hypothesis to a number of sources and, in every
case, we obtain an excellent fit, strengthening the interpretation of the
observed spectra as being due to secondary gamma rays. We explore the
ramifications of this interpretation for limits on the extragalactic background
light and for the production of cosmic rays in AGN. We also make predictions
for the neutrino signals, which can help probe acceleration of cosmic rays in
AGN.

strong lensing selected galaxy clusters using the Sunyaev Zel'dovich Array

arcminutes, while the strong lensing mass modeling constrains the mass at small
scales (typically < 30""). Combining the two provides information about the
projected concentrations of the strong lensing clusters. The Einstein radii we
measure are twice as large as expected given the masses inferred from SZ
scaling relations. A Monte Carlo simulation indicates that a sample randomly
drawn from the expected distribution would have a larger median Einstein radius
than the observed clusters about 3% of the time. The implied overconcentration
has been noted in previous studies with smaller samples of lensing clusters. It
persists for this sample, with the caveat that this could result from a
systematic effect such as if the gas fractions of the strong lensing clusters
are substantially below what is expected.

electrostatic coupling to the site occupied by an electron lowers the energy
level of the proton-binding site, making the proton transfer possible. In the
second model, roughly describing the redox loop in a nitrate respiration of E.
coli bacteria, an electron displaces a proton from the negative side of the
membrane to a shuttle, which subsequently diffuses across the membrane and
unloads the proton to its positive side. We show that both models can be
described by the same approach, which can be significantly simplified if the
system is separated into several clusters, with strong Coulomb interaction
inside each cluster and weak transfer couplings between them. We derive and
solve the equations of motion for the electron and proton creation/annihilation
operators, taking into account the appropriate Coulomb terms, tunnel couplings,
and the interaction with the environment. For the second model, these equations
of motion are solved jointly with a Langevin-type equation for the shuttle

both types of coupling, the delay always plays a subtle role in either
promoting or impairing synchronization. In particular, depending on the
inherent oscillation period of individual neurons, regions of irregular and
regular propagating excitatory fronts appear intermittently as the delay
increases. These delay-induced synchronization transitions are manifested as
well-expressed minima in the measure for spatiotemporal synchrony. For
attractive coupling, the minima appear at every integer multiple of the average
oscillation period, while for the repulsive coupling, they appear at every odd
multiple of the half of the average oscillation period. The obtained results
are robust to the variations of the dynamics of individual neurons, the system
size, and the neuronal firing type. Hence, they can be used to characterize
attractively or repulsively coupled scale-free neuronal networks with delays.

simulations to explore the amplification and decay of macroscopic turbulence
dynamo excited by the so-called Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI; a
Rayleigh-Taylor type instability). This instability is an inevitable outcome of
interactions between shock and ambient density fluctuations. We find that the
magnetic energy grows exponentially in a few eddy turnover times, and then,
following the decay of kinetic turbulence, decays with a temporal power-law
exponent of -0.7. The magnetic-energy fraction can reach $epsilon_B \sim$ 0.1
but depends on the initial magnetic field strength. We find that the magnetic
energy grows by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the magnetic
energy immediately behind the shock. This minimum degree of the amplification
does not depend on the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations, while the
growth timescale and the maximum magnetic energy depend on the degree of
inhomogeneity in the density. The transition from Kolmogorov cascade to MHD
critical balance cascade occurs at $\sim$ 1/10th the initial inhomogeneity
scale, which limits the maximum synchrotron polarization to less than 2%. New
results include the avoidance of electron cooling with RMI turbulence, the
turbulent photosphere model via RMI, and the shallow decay of the early
afterglow from RMI. We also performed a simulation of freely decaying
turbulence with relativistic velocity dispersion. We find that relativistic
turbulence begins to decay much faster than one eddy-turnover time because of
fast shock dissipation, which does not support the relativistic turbulence
model by Narayan & Kumar.

in Randall-Sundrum (RS) brane-world models in AdS5 spacetime. Yet there arise a
few important differences as compared to the results with a flat 3-brane or 4D
Minkowski spacetime. For example, the mass reduction formula (MRF)
$M_{Pl}^2=M_{5}^3 \ell_{AdS}$ as well as the relationship $M_{Pl}^2=
M_{Pl(4+n)}^{n+2} L^{n}$ (with $L$ being the average size or the radius of the
$n$ extra dimensions) expected in models of product-space (or Kaluza-Klein)
compactifications get modified in cosmological backgrounds. In an expanding
universe, a physically relevant MRF encodes information upon the
four-dimensional Hubble expansion parameter, in addition to the length and mass
parameters $L$, $M_{Pl}$ and $M_{Pl (4+n)}$. If a bulk cosmological constant is
present in the solution, then the reduction formula is further modified. With
these new insights, we show that the localization of a massless 4D graviton as
well as the mass hierarchy between $M_{Pl}$ and $M_{Pl (4+n)}$ can be explained
in cosmological brane-world models. A notable advantage of having a 5D de
Sitter bulk is that in this case the zero-mass wavefunction is normalizable,
which is not necessarily the case if the bulk spacetime is anti de Sitter. In
spacetime dimensions $D\ge 7$, however, the bulk cosmological constant
$\Lambda_b$ can take either sign ($\Lambda_b <0$, $=0$, or $>0$). The D=6 case
is rather inconclusive, in which case $\Lambda_b$ may be introduced together

is a key element in estimating the flux of astrophysical emissions, since the
measured signal depends on the convolution of the source spectral emission with
the instrument band shape.
  Laboratory Radio Frequency (RF) measurements of the instrument bandpass often
require complex test setups and are subject to a number of systematic effects
driven by thermal issues and impedance matching, particularly if cryogenic
operation is involved.
  In this paper we present an approach to modeling radiometers bandpasses by
integrating simulations and RF measurements of individual components. This
method is based on QUCS (Quasi Universal Circuit Simulator), an open-source
circuit simulator, which gives the flexibility of choosing among the available
devices, implementing new analytical software models or using measured
S-parameters. Therefore an independent estimate of the instrument bandpass is
achieved using standard individual component measurements and validated
analytical simulations.
  In order to automate the process of preparing input data, running simulations
and exporting results we developed the Python package python-qucs and released
it under GNU Public License.
  We discuss, as working cases, bandpass response modeling of the COFE and
Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) radiometers and compare results obtained
with QUCS and with a commercial circuit simulator software. The main purpose of
bandpass modeling in COFE is to optimize component matching, while in LFI they
represent the best estimation of frequency response, since end-to-end
measurements were strongly affected by systematic effects.

the presence of the doublet representations in T', there exist complex CG
coefficients, leading to explicit CP violation in the model, while the Yukawa
couplings and the vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields remain real.
The tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing matrix arises from the CG coefficients of T'.
In addition to the prediction for theta_{13} ~ (1/ (3\sqrt{2}) theta_{c}, the
model gives rise to a sum rule, tan^{2} theta_{sol} ~ tan^{2} theta_{sol, TBM}}
+ (1/2) theta_{c} cos(delta_{lep}), which is a consequence of the
Georgi-Jarlskog relations in the charged fermion sector. The predicted leptonic
Dirac CP phase, delta_{lep}, gives the correct value of the solar mixing angle,
and the predicted CP violation measures in the quark sector are consistent with
the current experimental data. Since the Dirac CP phase is the only
non-vanishing phase predicted in the lepton sector, there is a connection
between leptogenesis and low energy leptonic CP violating processes in our

shown recently that in this case there does not exist a quenched limiting

scaled in any manner) converge to a non-degenerate distribution. We show,
however, that the quenched distributions do have a limit in the weak sense.
That is, the quenched distributions of the hitting times -- viewed as a random

3.6um-selected galaxies of different M_* in the COSMOS field. The average SFR
for sub-sets of these galaxies is estimated with stacked 1.4GHz radio continuum
emission. We separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies (SF)
that shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frame
optical SED. At 0.2<z<3 both populations show a strong and M_*-independent
decrease in their SSFR towards z=0.2, best described by a power- law (1+z)^n,
where n~4.3 for all galaxies and n~3.5 for SF sources. The decrease appears to
have started at z>2, at least above 4x10^10M_Sun where our conclusions are most
robust. We find a tight correlation with power-law dependence, SSFR (M_*)^beta,
between SSFR and M_* at all z. It tends to flatten below ~10^10M_Sun if
quiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded a shallow index beta_SFG
-0.4 fits the correlation. On average, higher M_* objects always have lower
SSFRs, also among SF galaxies. At z>1.5 there is tentative evidence for an
upper SSFR-limit that an average galaxy cannot exceed. It is suggested by a
flattening of the SSFR-M_* relation (also for SF sources), but affects massive
(>10^10M_Sun) galaxies only at the highest z. Below z=1.5 there thus is no
direct evidence that galaxies of higher M_* experience a more rapid waning of
their SSFR than lower M_* SF systems. In this sense, the data rule out any
strong 'downsizing'. We combine our results with recent measurements of the
galaxy (stellar) mass function in order to determine the characteristic mass of
a SF galaxy (M_*=10^(10.6\pm0.4)M_Sun). In this sense, too, there is no
'downsizing'. Our analysis constitutes the most extensive SFR density
determination with a single technique to z=3. Recent Herschel results are
consistent with our results, but rely on far smaller samples.

Specifically, we find that finite size quantization allows Majorana end-states
even when the chemical potential is outside of the induced Zeeman gap where the
bulk material would not be topological. This is relevant to proposals utilizing
semiconducting quantum wires, however, we also find that the bulk energy gap is
substantially reduced if the induced magnetization is too large. We next
consider a slightly different geometry, and show that Majorana end-states can
be created at the ends of ferromagnetic domains. Finally, we consider the case
of meandering edges and find, surprisingly, that the existence of well-defined
transverse sub-bands is not necessary for the formation of robust Majorana
end-states.

characteristic age: young pulsars and their surrounding nebulae are efficient
X-ray emitters, whereas in contrast old pulsars are efficient gamma-ray
emitters. We divided the X-ray sample in a young (Tau < 1.7x10^4 yr) and old
sample and used linear regression to search for correlations between the
logarithm of the X-ray and gamma-ray luminosities and the logarithms of the
periods and period derivatives. The X-ray emission from young pulsars and their
nebulae are both consistent with L_X ~ Pdot^3/P^6. For old pulsars and their
nebulae the X-ray luminosity is consistent with a more or less constant
efficiency eta = L_X/Edot = ~ 8x10^-5. For the gamma-ray luminosity we confirm
that L_gamma ~ Edot^(1/2).

exceeding the known backgrounds where the light WIMP with large cross section
is supported. Motivated by this issue, we analyze a light neutralino dark
matter scenario with a very light CP-even Higgs mediation in the elastic
scattering process, which provides the mass and direct detection cross section
to explain the CoGeNT result. To be compatible with the result of other
experiments such as LEP and B-factories, the light CP-even Higgs is favored to
be in 9 to 10 GeV. Such a scenario can be realized in the ""Beyond the MSSM""
context. The relic abundance consistent with the WMAP result can be obtained
when twice of neutralino mass is close to the light Higgs mass via the
resonance enhancement of the annihilation cross section. As a result, the
neutralino mass is predicted to be at around 5 to 6 GeV.

estimate the ""missing"" baryonic mass associated with the shocks. The
absorption-line signatures predicted here may be used to construct ion-ratio
diagrams, which will serve as diagnostics for the photoionized gas in the
precursors. In my numerical models, the time-evolution of the shock structure,
self-radiation, and associated metal-ion column densities are computed by a
series of quasi-static models, each appropriate for a different shock age. The
shock code used in this work calculates the nonequilibrium ionization and
cooling, follows the radiative transfer of the shock self-radiation through the
post-shock cooling layers, takes into account the resulting photoionization and
heating rates, follows the dynamics of the cooling gas, and self-consistently
computes the photoionization states in the precursor gas. I present a complete
set of the age-dependent post-shock and precursor columns for all ionization

findings: (a) the star-formation rates of individual star-forming galaxies

field galaxies, and (b) the cluster harbours pockets of 'accelerated' activity
where galaxies have an enhanced probability of undergoing star formation. This
observation could be explained in a simple model of 'pre-processing' of
galaxies during cluster infall: galaxies in satellite groups have an increased
chance of having star-formation triggered via gravitational tidal interactions
compared to their counterparts in the field, but there is no environmental
mechanism boosting the individual star-formation rates of galaxies. We estimate
a lower-limit for the total star-formation rate of galaxies in the supercluster
as ~850 Msun/yr (field corrected). If this rate is maintained over the typical
infall time of a few Gyr, then the infall population could contribute
~1-2x10^12 Msun of stellar mass to the structure.

also detect a velocity gradient of ~6.5 km/s across the envelope, consistent
with the HI tracing a turbulent wake that arises from the motion of a
mass-losing star through the ISM. GBT mapping of a 2x2deg region around X Her
reveals that the star lies (in projection) near the periphery of a much larger
HI cloud that also exhibits signatures of ISM interaction. The properties of
the cloud are consistent with those of compact high-velocity clouds. Using CO

the probability of a chance coincidence in position, velocity, and apparent

are inconsistent with an origin tied directly to stellar ejection. (abridged)

  fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Science at
  K.U.Leuven, Belgium",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis investigates two main topics concerning black holes in extensions
of general relativity inspired by string theory. First, the structure of the
equations of motion underlying black hole solutions is considered, in theories
of D-dimensional gravity coupled to scalars and vectors. For solutions
preserving supersymmetry, the equations of motion have a dramatic
simplification: they become first-order instead of the second-order equations
one would expect. Recently, it was found that this is a feature some
non-supersymmetric black hole solutions exhibit as well. We investigate if this
holds more generally, by examining what the conditions are to have first-order
equations for the scalar fields of non-supersymmetric black holes, that mimic
the form of their supersymmetric counterparts. This is illustrated in examples.
Second, the structure of black holes themselves is investigated. String theory
has been successful in explaining the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for (mainly
supersymmetric) black holes from a microscopic perspective. However, it is not
fully established what the interpretation of the corresponding 'microstates'
should be in the gravitational description where the black hole picture is
valid. There have been recent advances to understand the nature of black hole
microstates in the gravity regime, such as the fuzzball proposal. A related
idea says that black hole configurations with multiple centers are related to
microstates of single-centered black holes. We report on work relating both
pictures. As an aside, a relation between violations of causality for certain
spacetimes (presence of closed timelike curves in the geometry) and a breakdown
of unitarity in the dual conformal field theory is given.

of LBGs, while the covering fraction of neutral atomic-dominated hydrogen gas
at high redshift is sufficient. We develop a theoretical framework to connect
this emission around LBGs to the expected emission from neutral H I gas i.e.,
damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs), using the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation.
Working under the hypothesis that the observed FUV emission in the outskirts of
LBGs is from in situ star formation in atomic-dominated hydrogen gas, the
results suggest that the SFR efficiency in such gas at z~3 is between factors
of 10 and 50 lower than predictions based on the local KS relation. The total
SFR density in atomic-dominated gas at z~3 is constrained to be ~10% of that
observed from the inner regions of LBGs. In addition, the metals produced by in
situ star formation in the outskirts of LBGs yield metallicities comparable to
those of DLAs, which is a possible solution to the ""Missing Metals"" problem for
DLAs. Finally, the atomic-dominated gas in the outskirts of galaxies at both

spheroidal shock propagating into the intracluster medium. We measure a
temperature jump across the surface brightness drop of a factor ~1.7, which

to the need to average over a fairly large region when measuring the

to the positions of the radio lobes, which is only the second such detection

divide galaxies into three classes accordingly : strong MIR-excess (N3-S11>0.2)
galaxies that include both unobscured and obscured star-forming galaxies, weak
MIR-excess (-2.0<N3-S11<-1.2) galaxies that are quiescent, old (>5 Gyr)
galaxies where the MIR emission arises mainly from the circumstellar dust
around AGB stars, and intermediate MIR-excess (-1.2<N3-S11<0.2) galaxies in
between the two classes that are less than a few Gyrs old past the prime star
formation activity. With the MIR-excess diagnostics, we investigate how local
and cluster-scale environments affect the individual galaxies. We derive the
total star formation rate of ~130 Msun/yr for A2255 using the strong MIR-excess
galaxies, which is consistent with other clusters of galaxies at similar
redshifts and with similar masses. We find no strong evidence that supports
enhanced star formation neither inside the cluster nor in the substructure
region. The intermediate MIR-excess galaxies, representing galaxies in
transition from star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies, are located
preferentially at the medium density region or cluster substructures. Our
findings suggest that galaxies are being transformed from star-forming galaxies
into red, quiescent galaxies from the infall region through near the core,

high fidelity over long times. Pulse sequences based on spin rotations about

accumulation of pulse errors. Concatenation provides an efficient way to
suppress the impact of pulse errors, and can maintain high fidelity for all
spin components: pulse errors do not accumulate (to first order) as the
concatenation level increases, despite the exponential increase in the number
of pulses. Our theoretical model gives a clear qualitative picture of the error
accumulation, and produces results in quantitative agreement with the

measurements, a precise reaction model coupled to a fair description of the
projectile is needed. We assume that the projectile initially possesses a
cluster structure, which is revealed by the dissociation process. This
structure is described by a few-body Hamiltonian involving effective forces
between the clusters. Within this assumption, we review various reaction
models. In semiclassical models, the projectile-target relative motion is
described by a classical trajectory and the reaction properties are deduced by
solving a time-dependent Schroedinger equation. We then describe the principle
and variants of the eikonal approximation: the dynamical eikonal approximation,
the standard eikonal approximation, and a corrected version avoiding Coulomb
divergence. Finally, we present the continuum-discretized coupled-channel
method (CDCC), in which the Schroedinger equation is solved with the projectile
continuum approximated by square-integrable states. These models are first
illustrated by applications to two-cluster projectiles for studies of nuclei
far from stability and of reactions useful in astrophysics. Recent extensions

conservative extensions of the underlying operational semantics. Providing
criteria under which such equations are preserved is extremely useful; in
particular, it can avoid the need to repeat proofs when extending the specified
language.
  This paper investigates preservation of sound equations for several notions
of bisimilarity on open terms: closed-instance (ci-)bisimilarity and
formal-hypothesis (fh-)bisimilarity, both due to Robert de Simone, and
hypothesis-preserving (hp-)bisimilarity, due to Arend Rensink. For both
fh-bisimilarity and hp-bisimilarity, we prove that arbitrary sound equations on
open terms are preserved by all disjoint extensions which do not add labels. We
also define slight variations of fh- and hp-bisimilarity such that all sound
equations are preserved by arbitrary disjoint extensions. Finally, we give two
sets of syntactic criteria (on equations, resp. operational extensions) and
prove each of them to be sufficient for preserving ci-bisimilarity.

symmetric sum types, by which we can type non-deterministic orchestration
choice behaviours. While the original branching type in session types can
represent a choice made by a single participant and accepted by others
determining how the session proceeds, the symmetric sum type represents a
choice made by agreement among all the participants of a session. Such
behaviour can be found in many practical systems, including collaborative
workflow in healthcare systems for clinical practice guidelines (CPGs).
Processes using the symmetric sums can be embedded into the original branching
types using conductor processes. We show that this type-driven embedding
preserves typability, satisfies semantic soundness and completeness, and meets
the encodability criteria adapted to the typed setting. The theory leads to an
efficient implementation of a prototypical tool for CPGs which automatically
translates the original CPG specifications from a representation called the
Process Matrix to symmetric sum types, type checks programs and executes them.

separate choice). The proof of this result argues with their different
expressive power concerning leader election in symmetric networks. Later on,
Gorla offered an arguably simpler proof that, instead of leader election in
symmetric networks, employed the reducibility of incestual processes (mixed
choices that include both enabled senders and receivers for the same channel)
when running two copies in parallel. In both proofs, the role of breaking
(initial) symmetries is more or less apparent. In this paper, we shed more
light on this role by re-proving the above result - based on a proper
formalization of what it means to break symmetries without referring to another
layer of the distinguishing problem domain of leader election. Both Palamidessi
and Gorla rephrased their results by stating that there is no uniform and
reasonable encoding from \pimix into \pisep. We indicate how the respective
proofs can be adapted and exhibit the consequences of varying notions of
uniformity and reasonableness. In each case, the ability to break initial

changed during the lag timescale. The anti-correlated soft lags are associated
with spectral variability during which the geometry of the accretion disk is
changed. The observed temporal and spectral variations are explained using the
framework of truncated disk geometry. We found that during the lag timescale,
the centroid frequency of quasi-periodic oscillation is decreased, the soft

argue that these changes could be explained if we assume that the hot corona

  Results {We detect a hard X-ray lag of $192\pm33$ s in a specific section of

gamma-ray peaks occurred near the beginning of two major mm-wave outbursts,
each of which is associated with a linear polarization maximum at millimeter
wavelengths. Our Very Long Baseline Array observations indicate that the two
mm-wave flares originated in the second of two features in the jet that are
separated by >14 pc. The simultaneity of the peak of the higher-amplitude
gamma-ray flare and the maximum in polarization of the second jet feature
implies that the gamma-ray and mm-wave flares are co-spatial and occur >14 pc
from the central engine. We also associate two optical flares, accompanied by
sharp polarization peaks, with the two gamma-ray events. The multi-waveband
behavior is most easily explained if the gamma-rays arise from synchrotron
self-Compton scattering of optical photons from the flares. We propose that
flares are triggered by interaction of moving plasma blobs with a standing
shock. The gamma-ray and optical emission is quenched by inverse Compton losses
as synchrotron photons from the newly shocked plasma cross the emission region.
The mm-wave polarization is high at the onset of a flare, but decreases as the
electrons emitting at these wavelengths penetrate less polarized regions.

$\Delta T_c/T_c \propto N^{-1/3}$ is inaccurate when $N \leqslant 10^{5}$, the
next order (proportional to $N^{-1/2}$) being significant. We also show that
finite size effects on the condensation temperature cancel out in a cubic

a generic power-law potential of higher order, e.g. $V(\mathbi{r}) \propto

positive. This effect provides a large increase of $T_c$ for relatively small

with stationary increments. We introduce some new spaces associated with the
self-reproducing kernel space and we define the Paley-Wiener integral of first

in $L^2$. If $X$ has stationary increments, we provide necessary and sufficient
conditions so that its paths belong to the self-reproducing kernel space. We
develop Skorohod calculus and its relation with symmetric-Stratonovich type
integrals and two types of It\^o's formula. One of Skorohod type, which works
under very general (even very singular) conditions for the covariance; the
second one of symmetric-Stratonovich type, which works, when the covariance is
at least as regular as the one of a fractional Brownian motion of Hurst index
equal to $H = \frac{1}{4}$.

Hochschild functor determines a constant commutative factorization algebra.
Conversely, every constant commutative factorization algebra is naturally
equivalent to a Hochschild chain factorization algebra. Similarly, we study the
relationship between the above concepts and topological chiral homology. In
particular, we show that on their common domains of definition, the higher
Hochschild functor is naturally equivalent to topological chiral homology.
Finally, we prove that topological chiral homology determines a locally
constant factorization algebra and, further, that this functor induces an
equivalence between locally constant factorization algebras on a manifold and
(local system of) $E_n$-algebras. We also deduce that Hochschild chains and

twist and stretch single molecules to probe their elastic properties. It is
known that thermal fluctuations play an important role in determining molecular
elastic properties, but a full theoretical treatment of the problem of twist
elasticity of fluctuating ribbons using the simplest worm like chain model
(WLC) remains elusive. In this paper, we approach this problem by taking first
a mechanical approach and then incorporating thermal effects in a quadratic
approximation applying the Gelfand-Yaglom (GY) method for computing fluctuation
determinants. Our study interpolates between mechanics and statistical
mechanics in a controlled way and shows how profoundly thermal fluctuations
affect the elasticity of semiflexible polymers. The new results contained here

expressions for their energy and writhe and plots of the extension versus Link

twisted polymers derived by the Gelfand Yaglom method. We use insights derived
from our mechanical approach to suggest calculational schemes that lead to an
improved treatment of thermal fluctuations. From the derived formulae,

nominal scientific goal of determining an acceptable dose, most often based on
adverse event probabilities. This arose from a tradition of phase I trials to
evaluate cytotoxic agents for treating cancer, although some methods may be
applied in other medical settings, such as treatment of stroke or immunological
diseases. Most modern statistical designs for early phase trials include
model-based, outcome-adaptive decision rules that choose doses for successive
patient cohorts based on data from previous patients in the trial. Such designs
have seen limited use in clinical practice, however, due to their complexity,
the requirement of intensive, computer-based data monitoring, and the medical
community's resistance to change. Still, many actual applications of
model-based outcome-adaptive designs have been remarkably successful in terms
of both patient benefit and scientific outcome. In this paper I will review
several Bayesian early phase trial designs that were tailored to accommodate
specific complexities of the treatment regime and patient outcomes in

the same way as it is broken in vacuum QCD and gives rise to an octet of
pseudo-Goldstone bosons and a superfluid mode. The lightest of these are the
charged and neutral kaons. For energies below the superconducting gap, the
kaons are described by an $O(2)\times O(2)$-symmetric effective scalar field
theory with chemical potentials. We use this effective theory to study
Bose-condensation of kaons and their properties as functions of the temperature

formalism in the Hartree approximation. The renormalization of the gap

determine the phase diagram and the medium-dependent quasiparticle masses. It
is shown that the Goldstone theorem is satisfied to a very good approximation.

remarkable that the timescales of QPPs are distributed in a broad range from
hecto-second (very long period pulsation, VLP, the period P>100 s), deca-second
(long period pulsation, LPP, 10<P<100 s), few seconds (short period pulsation,

0.1<P<1.0 s), to centi-second (fast-very short period pulsation, fast-VSP,
P<0.1 s), and forms a broad hierarchy of timescales. The statistical
distribution in logarithmic period-duration space indicates that QPPs can be
classified into two groups: group I includes VLP, LPP, SPP and part of
slow-VSPs distributed around a line approximately; group II includes fast-VSP
and most of slow-VSP dispersively distributed away from the above line. This
feature implies that the generation mechanism of group I is different from
group II. Group I is possibly related with some MHD oscillations in magnetized
plasma loops in the active region, e.g., VLP may be generated by standing slow
sausage mode coupling and resonating with the underlying photospheric 5-min
oscillation, the modulation is amplified and forms the main framework of the
whole flare/CME process; LPP, SPP, and part of slow-VSPs are most likely to be
caused by standing fast modes or LRC-circuit resonance in current-carrying
plasma loops. Group II is possibly generated by modulations of resistive
tearing-mode oscillations in electric current-carrying flaring loops.

starburst galaxies have a high star formation rate and plenty of dust in the
central starburst region, infrared emissions are strong there. Gamma-ray
photons are absorbed by the interstellar radiation field photons via electron
and positron pair creation. The generated electron and positron pairs up
scatter the interstellar photons to very high energy gamma-ray photons via
cascade emission through inverse Compton scattering. In this paper, we evaluate
the contribution of this cascade emission to the gamma-ray spectra of M82 and
NGC 253. Although it would be difficult to see direct gamma- ray evidence of
cosmic-rays with an energy > 10 TeV due to the gamma-ray attenuation, the
resulting cascade emission would be indirect evidence. By including the cascade
component, we find that the total flux above 1 TeV increases ~18% and ~45%
compared with the absorbed flux assuming the maximum kinetic proton energy as
45.3 TeV and 512 TeV, respectively. Future gamma-ray observatories such as CTA
would be able to see the indirect evidence of cosmic-ray with an energy > 10

effect.

the initial mass function (IMF) of stars is universal, or instead sensitive to
the initial conditions of star formation. The distinction is of critical
importance: the IMF influences most of the observable properties of stellar
populations and galaxies, and detecting variations in the IMF could provide
deep insights into the process by which stars form. In this contribution, we
take a critical look at the case for IMF variations, with a view towards
whether other explanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the
field, local young clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest
that the vast majority were drawn from a ""universal"" IMF. Observations of
resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of most galaxies are
also consistent with a ""universal IMF"", suggesting no gross variations in the
IMF over much of cosmic time. Here we focus on 1) nearby star-forming regions,
where individual stars can be resolved to give a complete view of the IMF, 2)
star-burst environments, in particular super-star clusters which are some of
the most extreme objects in the universe and 3) nearby stellar systems (e.g.
globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies) that formed at high redshift
and can be studied in extreme detail (i.e. near-field cosmology).

telescopes located in 4 buildings at the perimeter of the surface array. The
fluorescence telescopes, each consisting of 440 photomultipliers, collect the
ultraviolet light produced when the charged secondary particles in an air
shower excite nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere. Because the intensity of

additional bending constraints. However, the degree to which bending governs
network mechanics remains a subject of considerable debate. We study disordered
fibrous networks with variable coordination number, both above and below the

stretching- to bending-dominated elasticity. Strikingly, this crossover
exhibits an anomalous power-law dependence of the shear modulus on both

Santos","Model of collimated jets with high energy particles","21 pages, 6 figures, submitted to A & A",,,,"astro-ph.HE gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The increasing data set of precise observations of very energetic and
collimated jets, with black hole (BH) as putative central engine, at different
astrophysical scales and in various environments, should soon permit to
discriminate and classify current theoretical models able to describe the jets
formation. We construct a purely gravitational theoretical model of perfectly
collimated jets of high energy particles in the ideal case where the central
engine is a Kerr BH of mass $M$ and angular momentum by unit of mass $a$. We
study in Weyl coordinates ($\rho $, $z$) the unbound Kerr 2D-geodesics which
are asymptotes to straight lines parallel to the $z$ axis of equations \rho
=constant= \rho_{1}= [(a/M)^2+Q/(E^2-1)]^{1/2} of which existence was recently
demonstrated (Gariel et al.,A & A, 2010). On these geodesics, flow test
particles of energy $E$, with a Carter constant $Q$ and (necessarily) an
angular momentum $L_{z}=0$. Studying the characteristics of the geodesics
equations system, in the special case of a double root, we exhibit jets with a
radial structure, whose energy flux can be calculated. From the observed data
of the jet powers, we obtain the mean particles density, the particles flow,
the speed and the Lorentz factor of the jets, for any charged or neutral test
particle. Then, we numerically apply these results to electrons. We also
discuss the domains of initial conditions for geodesics starting inside the
ergosphere. All these results come from the Kerr spacetime structure, and
enhance the Penrose process as a plausible origin for the high energy jets.

homoclinic orbits near a heteroclinic cycle connecting an equilibrium E and a
periodic orbit P. Along this curve the homoclinic orbit performs more and more
windings about the periodic orbit. Typically this behaviour appears in
reversible Hamiltonian systems. Here we discuss this phenomenon in systems
without any particular structure. We give a rigorous analytical verification of
homoclinic snaking under certain assumptions on the behaviour of the stable and
unstable manifolds of E and P. We show how the snaking behaviour depends on the
signs of the Floquet multipliers of P. Further we present a nonsnaking
scenario. Finally we show numerically that these assumptions are fulfilled in a
model equation.

In addition, we show that the explicit information supplied by the special

closes and to determine the associated structure equations of the algebras for
each $k$. We have no proof that our generating symmetries are of lowest
possible order, but we have no counterexamples, and we are confident we can can
always find any missing generators from our raising and lowering operator
recurrences. We also get for free, one variable models of the action of the

2.29^{+0.25}_{-0.39}$ mag, corresponding to a progenitor luminosity of log
$L$/L$_{\odot}$ $\sim4.54\pm0.19$ dex. Using the stellar evolution code STARS,
we find this to be consistent with a red supergiant progenitor with $M =
8.5_{-1.5}^{+6.5}$ M$_{\odot}$. The photometric and spectroscopic evolution of
SN 2009md is similar to that of the class of sub-luminous Type IIP SNe; in this
paper we compare the evolution of SN 2009md primarily to that of the
sub-luminous SN 2005cs. We estimate the mass of $^{56}$Ni ejected in the
explosion to be $(5.4\pm1.3) \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$\ from the luminosity
on the radioactive tail, which is in agreement with the low $^{56}$Ni masses
estimated for other sub-luminous Type IIP SNe. From the lightcurve and spectra,
we show the SN explosion had a lower energy and ejecta mass than the normal
Type IIP SN 1999em. We discuss problems with stellar evolutionary models, and
the discrepancy between low observed progenitor luminosities (log
$L$/L$_{\odot}$ $\sim4.3-5$ dex) and model luminosities after the
second-dredge-up for stars in this mass range, and consider an enhanced carbon
burning rate as a possible solution. In conclusion, SN 2009md is a faint SN
arising from the collapse of a progenitor close to the lower mass limit for
core-collapse. This is now the third discovery of a low mass progenitor star
producing a low energy explosion and low $^{56}$Ni ejected mass, which
indicates that such events arise from the lowest end of the mass range that
produces a core-collapse supernova (7-8 M$_{\odot}$).

observational techniques - photometry, interferometry, and period variation.
Methods: The use of BVR photometry of the close-contact binary KR Com, which is
the primary component of a triple system, helps us to better describe the
properties of the components. The interferometric data obtained during the last
30 years sufficiently determine the visual orbit, but the use of minima timings
of KR Com for the study of period variation together with the visual orbit is a
novel approach in this system. Results: Basic physical parameters resulting
from the light curve analysis agree well with the previous results from
spectroscopy. The temperatures for the primary and secondary component resulted
in 5549 and 6072 K, respectively, and the amount of the third light in all
filters is about 1/3 of the total luminosity. The distant third component
revolves around the common barycenter on 11 yr orbit with a very high
eccentricity (0.934) and this movement is also detectable via the period
variation, which is clearly visible in the O-C diagram of times of minima
observations. The use of minima times for the combined analysis helps us to
independently determine the distance to the system (64.02 +/- 9.42 pc) and also
to confirm the orientation of the orbit in space. Conclusions: New minima
observations and also spectroscopy would be very profitable, especially during
the next periastron passage in the year 2017.

z=7 is important for ascertaining their role in the reionization of the
Universe. We perform a detailed and critical analysis of the statistical and
systematic errors in the z~7 LF determination: we have assembled a large sample
of candidate LBGs at z~7 from different surveys, spanning a large variety of
areas and depths. In particular, we have combined data from the deep (J<27.4)
and ultradeep (J<29.2) surveys recently acquired with the new WFC3 NIR camera
on HST, over the GOODS-ERS and the HUDF fields, with ground based surveys in
wide and shallow areas from VLT and Subaru. We have used public ACS images in
the z-band to select z-dropout galaxies, and other public data both in the blue
(BVI) and in the red bands to reject possible low-redshift interlopers. We have
compared our results with extensive simulations to quantify the observational
effects of our selection criteria as well as the effects of photometric
scatter, color selections or the morphology of the candidates. We have found
that the number density of faint LBGs at z~7 is only marginally sensitive to
the color selection adopted, but it is strongly dependent from the assumption
made on the half light distributions of the simulated galaxies, used to correct
the observed sample for incompleteness. The slope of the faint end of the LBGs
LF has thus a rather large uncertainty, due to the unknown distribution of
physical sizes of the z~7 LBGs. We conclude that galaxies at z~7 are unable to
reionize the Universe unless there is a significant evolution in the clumpiness
of the IGM or in the escape fraction of ionising photons or, alternatively,
there is a large population of z~7 LBGs with large physical dimensions but
still not detected by the present observations.

Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/200913797",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Whenever stars are rotating very fast (Omega/Omega_crit > 0.7, with
Omega_crit the Keplerian angular velocity of the star accounting for its
deformation) radiative stellar winds are enhanced in polar regions. This
theoretical prediction is now confirmed by interferometric observations of fast
rotating stars.} Polar winds remove less angular momentum than spherical winds
and thus allow the star to keep more angular momentum. We quantitatively assess
the importance of this effect.
  First we use a semi-analytical approach to estimate the variation of the
angular momentum loss when the rotation parameter increases. Then we compute
complete 9 MSun stellar models at very high angular velocities (starting on the
ZAMS with Omega/Omega_crit = 0.8 and reaching the critical velocity during the
Main Sequence) with and without radiative wind anisotropies.
  When wind anisotropies are accounted for, the angular momentum loss rate is
reduced by less than 4% for Omega/Omega_crit < 0.9 with respect to the case of
spherical winds. The reduction amounts to at most 30% when the star is rotating
near the critical velocity. These values result from two counteracting effects:
on the one hand polar winds reduce the loss of angular momentum, on the other
hand, surface deformations imply that the mass which is lost at high
co-latitude is lost at a larger distance from the rotational axis and thus
removes more angular momentum.
  In contrast with previous studies, which neglected surface deformations, we
show that the radiative wind anisotropies have a relatively modest effect on
the evolution of the angular momentum content of fast rotating stars.

general relativity, the new theory provides a natural alternative to the view
that the singularity is inevitable in general relativity and in the theory of a
hot Universe. We show that the macroscopic source-sink motion of the ordinary
(dark) matter during production-absorption of particles by vacuum generates
polarization (determining the variability of the cosmological term in general
relativity). We have removed the well-known problems of the cosmological
constant by refining the physical nature of dark energy associated precisely
with this hydrodynamically initiated variability of the vacuum energy density.
A new exact solution of the modified general relativity equations that contains
no free (fitting) parameter (additional to thouse available in general
relativity) has been obtained. It corresponds to continuous and
metric-affecting production of ultralight dark matter particles out of vacuum,
with its density being retaned constant during the expansion of spatially flat
Universe. This solution is shown to be stable in the regime of cosmological
expansion untill Tmax about 38 billion years. After that time, the solution
becomes unstable and characterizes the inverse process of dark matter particles
absorption by the vacuum in the regime of contraction of the Universe. The
physical nature of dark matter particles is considered and their mass is
estimated. Good quantitative agreement of the indicated exact solution with
cosmological observations (SnIa, SDSS-BAO and recently found reduction of
