our space-time does to us. A processing grid network is proposed to underlie
not just matter and energy, but also space and time. The suggested ""screen"" for
our familiar three dimensional world is a hyper-sphere surface simulated by a
grid network. Light and matter then travel, or are transmitted, in the
""directions"" of the grid architecture. The processing sequences of grid nodes
create time, as the static states of movies run together emulate events. Yet
here what exists are not the static states, but the dynamic processing between
them. Quantum collapse is the irreversible event that gives time its direction.
In this model, empty space is null processing, directions are node links, time
is processing cycles, light is a processing wave, objects are wave tangles and
energy is the processing transfer rate. It describes a world where empty space
is not empty, space warps, time dilates, and everything began when this virtual
universe ""booted up"".

against an in-situ formation and are strongly suggestive of a capture origin.
Since the last detailed investigations of their dynamics, the total number of
satellites have doubled, increasing from 50 to 109, and almost tripled in the
case of Saturn system. We have performed a new dynamical exploration of Saturn
system to test whether the larger sample of bodies could improve our
understanding of which dynamical features are primordial and which are the
outcome of the secular evolution of the system. We have performed detailed
N--Body simulations using the best orbital data available and analysed the
frequencies of motion to search for resonances and other possible perturbing
effects. We took advantage of the Hierarchical Jacobian Symplectic algorithm to
include in the dynamical model of the system also the gravitational effects of
the two outermost massive satellites, Titan and Iapetus. Our results suggest
that Saturn's irregular satellites have been significantly altered and shaped
by the gravitational perturbations of Jupiter, Titan, Iapetus and the Sun and
by the collisional sweeping effect of Phoebe. In particular, the effects on the
dynamical evolution of the system of the two massive satellites appear to be
non-negligible. Jupiter perturbs the satellites through its direct
gravitational pull and, indirectly, via the effects of the Great Inequality,
i.e. its almost resonance with Saturn. Finally, by using the Hierarchical
Clustering Method we found hints to the existence of collisional families and
compared them with the available observational data.

with zero: {\lambda} = -4.7 \pm 4.0{\deg}, {\lambda} = 15 + 33{\deg}/-43{\deg}
and {\lambda} = -9.7 +9.0{\deg}/-7.7{\deg}, respectively. The host stars have
Teff < 6250 K and conform with the trend of cooler stars having low
obliquities. WASP-38b is a massive planet on a moderately long period,
eccentric orbit so may be expected to have a misaligned orbit given the high
obliquities measured in similar systems. However, we find no evidence for a
large spin-orbit angle. By contrast, WASP-1b joins the growing number of
misaligned systems and has an almost polar orbit, {\lambda} = -79
+4.5{\deg}/-4.3{\deg}. It is neither very massive, eccentric nor orbiting a hot
host star, and therefore does not share the properties of many other misaligned
systems.

overluminous, with a (pseudo-bolometric) peak luminosity of log(L) = 43.47
[erg/s]. Its light curves decline slowly over half a year after maximum light,
and the early-time near-IR light curves show secondary maxima, although the
minima between the first and second peaks are not very pronounced. Bluer bands
exhibit an enhanced fading after ~200 d, which might be caused by dust
formation or an unexpectedly early IR catastrophe. The spectra of SN 2009dc are
dominated by intermediate-mass elements and unburned material at early times,
and by iron-group elements at late phases. Strong C II lines are present until
~2 weeks past maximum, which is unprecedented in thermonuclear SNe. The ejecta
velocities are significantly lower than in normal and even subluminous SNe Ia.
No signatures of CSM interaction are found in the spectra. Assuming that the
light curves are powered by radioactive decay, analytic modelling suggests that
SN 2009dc produced ~1.8 solar masses of 56Ni assuming the smallest possible
rise time of 22 d. Together with a derived total ejecta mass of ~2.8 solar
masses, this confirms that SN 2009dc is a member of the class of possible
super-Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia similar to SNe 2003fg, 2006gz and 2007if. A
study of the hosts of SN 2009dc and other superluminous SNe Ia reveals a
tendency of these SNe to explode in low-mass galaxies. A low metallicity of the
progenitor may therefore be an important pre-requisite for producing
superluminous SNe Ia. We discuss a number of explosion scenarios, ranging from
super-Chandrasekhar-mass white-dwarf progenitors over dynamical white-dwarf
mergers and Type I 1/2 SNe to a core-collapse origin of the explosion. None of
the models seem capable of explaining all properties of SN 2009dc, so that the
true nature of this SN and its peers remains nebulous.

and give applications to several classic lattice problems, including the
Shortest and Closest Vector Problems (SVP and CVP, respectively) and Integer
Programming (IP). Our enumeration technique relies on a classical concept from
asymptotic convex geometry known as the M-ellipsoid, and uses as a crucial
subroutine the recent algorithm of Micciancio and Voulgaris (STOC 2010) for
lattice problems in the l_2 norm. As a main technical contribution, which may
be of independent interest, we build on the techniques of Klartag (Geometric
and Functional Analysis, 2006) to give an expected 2^O(n)-time algorithm for
computing an M-ellipsoid for any n-dimensional convex body.
  As applications, we give deterministic 2^{O(n)}-time and -space algorithms
for solving exact SVP, and exact CVP when the target point is sufficiently
close to the lattice, on n-dimensional lattices in any (semi-)norm given an
M-ellipsoid of the unit ball. In many norms of interest, including all l_p
norms, an M-ellipsoid is computable in deterministic poly(n) time, in which
case these algorithms are fully deterministic. Here our approach may be seen as
a derandomization of the ""AKS sieve"" for exact SVP and CVP (Ajtai, Kumar, and
Sivakumar; STOC 2001 and CCC 2002).
  As a further application of our SVP algorithm, we derive an expected
O(f*(n))^n-time algorithm for Integer Programming, where f*(n) denotes the
optimal bound in the so-called ""flatness theorem,"" which satisfies f*(n) =
O(n^{4/3} \polylog(n)) and is conjectured to be f*(n)=\Theta(n). Our runtime
improves upon the previous best of O(n^{2})^{n} by Hildebrand and Koppe (2010).

interconnects between light and matter in integrated quantum information

lighthouse beam pattern indicates the presence of a wide binary. The compact
and dense dusty core in the center of the nebula can be studied by means of
optical interferometry. M2-9 was observed with VLTI/MIDI at 39-47 m baselines
with the UT2-UT3 and UT3-UT4 baseline configurations. These observations are
interpreted using a dust radiative transfer Monte Carlo code. A disk-like
structure is detected perpendicular to the lobes and a good fit is found with a
stratified disk model composed of amorphous silicates. The disk is compact,
25$\times$35 mas at 8$\rm \mu m$, and 37$\times$46 mas at 13$\rm \mu m$. For
the adopted distance of 1.2 kpc, the inner rim of the disk is $\sim$15 AU. The
mass represents a few percent of the mass found in the lobes. The compactness
of the disk puts strong constraints on the binary content of the system, given
an estimated orbital period 90-120yr. We derive masses of the binary components
between 0.6--1.0M$_{\sun}$ for a white dwarf and 0.6--1.4M$_{\sun}$ for an

However, these queue-length-based schemes could potentially suffer from large

whereby packets belonging to some flows may be excessively delayed due to lack
of subsequent packet arrivals. Delay-based schemes have the potential to
resolve this last packet problem by scheduling the link based on the delay the

delay-based schemes has largely been an open problem in multihop wireless
networks (except in limited cases where the traffic is single-hop.) In this
paper, we investigate delay-based scheduling schemes for multihop traffic
scenarios with fixed routes. We develop a scheduling scheme based on a new
delay metric, and show that the proposed scheme achieves optimal throughput
performance. Further, we conduct simulations to support our analytical results,
and show that the delay-based scheduler successfully removes excessive packet
delays, while it achieves the same throughput region as the queue-length-based

Study of a streamwise constant model is motivated by numerical and experimental
observations that suggest the prevalence and importance of streamwise and
quasi-streamwise elongated structures. Periodic spanwise/wall-normal (z-y)
plane stream functions are used as input to develop a forced 2D/3C streamwise
velocity field that is qualitatively similar to a fully turbulent spatial field
of DNS data. The input-output response associated with the 2D/3C nonlinear
coupling is used to estimate the energy optimal spanwise wavelength over a
range of Reynolds numbers. The results of the input-output analysis agree with
previous studies of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. The optimal energy
corresponds to minimal nonlinear coupling. On the other hand, the nature of the
forced 2D/3C streamwise velocity field provides evidence that the nonlinear
coupling in the 2D/3C model is responsible for creating the well known
characteristic ""S"" shaped turbulent velocity profile. This indicates that there
is an important tradeoff between energy amplification, which is primarily
linear and the seemingly nonlinear momentum transfer mechanism that produces a
turbulent-like mean profile.

existence of a mean field equilibrium in such games. Furthermore, as a simple
consequence of this existence theorem, we obtain several natural monotonicity
properties. We show that there exist a ""largest"" and a ""smallest"" equilibrium

magnetic materials known to exhibit a nonzero muon spin polarization relaxation
rate, $\lambda(T)$, down to the lowest temperature (T) studied. Such behaviour
is typically interpreted as a significant level of persisting spin dynamics
(PSD) of the host material. In the case of Gd2Sn2O7, such PSD comes as a
surprise since magnetic specific heat measurements suggest conventional gapped
magnons, which would naively lead to an exponentially vanishing $\lambda(T)$ as
$T \rightarrow 0$. In contrast to most materials that display PSD, the ordered
phase of Gd2Sn2O7 is well characterized and both the nature and the magnitude
of the interactions have been inferred from the magnetic structure and the
temperature dependence of the magnetic specific heat. Based on this
understanding, the temperature dependence of the muon spin polarization
relaxation through the scattering of spin waves (magnons) is calculated. The
result explicitly shows that, despite the unusual extensive number of weakly
dispersive (gapped)excitations characterizing Gd2Sn2O7, a remnant of the zero
modes of the parent frustrated pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet, the
temperature dependence of the calculated $\lambda(T)$ differs dramatically from
the experimental one. Indeed, the calculation conforms to the naive expectation
of an exponential collapse of $\lambda(T)$ at temperatures below ~ 0.7K. This
result, for the first time, illustrates crisply and quantitatively the paradox
that presents itself with the pervasive occurrence of PSD in highly frustrated
magnetic systems as evinced by muon spin relaxation measurements.

and the sensor. Recovering depth information from two-dimensional images of a
scene is an important task in computer vision that can assist numerous
applications such as object recognition, scene interpretation, obstacle
avoidance, inspection and assembly. Various passive depth computation
techniques have been developed for computer vision applications. They can be
classified into two groups. The first group operates using just one image. The
second group requires more than one image which can be acquired using either
multiple cameras or a camera whose parameters and positioning can be changed.
This project is aimed to find the real depth of the object from the camera
which had been used to click the photograph. An n-degree polynomial was
formulated, which maps the pixel depth of an image to the real depth. In order
to find the coefficients of the polynomial, an experiment was carried out for a
particular lens and thus, these coefficients are a unique feature of a
particular camera. The procedure explained in this report is a monocular
approach for estimation of depth of a scene. The idea involves mapping the
Pixel Depth of the object photographed in the image with the Real Depth of the
object from the camera lens with an interpolation function. In order to find
the parameters of the interpolation function, a set of lines with predefined
distance from camera is used, and then the distance of each line from the
bottom edge of the picture (as the origin line) is calculated.

some of its fundamental functions. A solution for the vulnerability of trust
must thus be sought elsewhere, without tampering with its distribution. This

different method for securing trust: not by redistributing it, but by mining
for its sources. The method used to break privacy is thus also used to secure
trust. A high level view of the mining methods that connect the two is provided
in terms of *similarity networks*, and *spectral decomposition* of similarity

Fe2VAl0.95. The reduced value of the ratio ms/mp = 0.08, where mp = 1.4 mB/Fe
is the effective Curie-Weiss moment, together with the analysis of the
magnetization data M(H,T), show magnetism is of itinerant nature. The specific
heat shows an unusual temperature variation at low temperatures with an
enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient, g = 12 mJK-2mol-1. The resistivity, r(T), is
metallic and follows a power law behavior r(T) = r0+AT^n with n = 1.5 below TC.
With applying pressure, TC decreases with the rate of (1/TC)(dTC /dP) = -0.061
GPa-1. We conclude substitution on the Al-site with Fe and V atoms results in
itinerant ferromagnetism with a low carrier density.

Here a photon is an entity program spreading as a processing wave of instances.
It becomes a ""particle"" if any part of it overloads the grid network that runs
it, causing the photon program to reboot and restart at a new node. The
""collapse of the wave function"" is how quantum processing creates what we call

the law of least action, entanglement, superposition, counterfactuals, the
holographic principle and the measurement problem. The conceptual cost is that

displaying solitonic properties. To understand the mechanism by which such
self-sustained modes are generated, and mainly the changes on probe spectrum
induced by the cross-phase-modulation effect for an harmonic probe trapped by a
multiplex of temporal pulses, a linear equation (for the probe) and a nonlinear

cross-phase to the self-phase modulation strengths. However, for certain values
of this ratio, the probe modulation wavector develops into $|n,l\textgreater$

spectral properties can be characterized unambiguously. Solutions of the probe

a quasi-continuum of soliton modes when the cross-phase-modulation coupling is

focussing in particular on the dynamics of quantum vortices in these systems.
We demonstrate that the coherence of the classical field can be characterised
by its temporal correlations, and discuss how the phase-symmetry-broken
averages familiar from mean-field theories emerge from the field trajectories.
We show that a finite-temperature condensate containing a precessing vortex in
a cylindrically symmetric trap can be realised as an ergodic equilibrium of the
classical-field theory, and demonstrate the identification of the rotationally
symmetry-broken condensate orbital and core-filling thermal component from the
field correlations. We then consider the nonequilibrium dynamics that result
when such a precessing-vortex configuration is subjected to a static trap
anisotropy which arrests its rotation, and observe novel coupled relaxation
dynamics of the condensed and noncondensed components of the field. Finally, we
consider the nucleation of vortices in an initially zero-temperature
quasi-two-dimensional condensate stirred by a rotating trap anisotropy. We
quantify the emergence of a rotating thermal component of the field, which
drives the nucleation of vortices from condensate-surface oscillations, and
study the relaxation and rotational equilibration of the initially turbulent
collection of vortices. We find that thermal fluctuations of the field prevent
the vortices from settling into a rigid crystalline lattice in this reduced
dimensionality, and that true condensation in the field is completely destroyed
by the disordered motion of vortices. We show, however, that the temporal
correlations of the field distinguish the quasi-coherent vortex-liquid phase in
the trap centre from the truly thermal material in its periphery.

equivalence class of torsion-free connections and a conformal structure
satisfying a compatibility condition which is automatic in two dimensions. They
generalize Weyl structures, and a pair of AH structures is induced on a
co-oriented non-degenerate immersed hypersurface in flat affine space. The
author has defined for AH structures Einstein equations, which specialize on
the one hand to the usual Einstein Weyl equations and, on the other hand, to
the equations for affine hyperspheres. Here these equations are solved for
Riemannian signature AH structures on compact orientable surfaces, the
deformation spaces of solutions are described, and some aspects of the geometry
of these structures are related. Every such structure is either Einstein Weyl
(in the sense defined for surfaces by Calderbank) or is determined by a pair
comprising a conformal structure and a cubic holomorphic differential, and so
by a convex flat real projective structure. In the latter case it can be
identified with a solution of the Abelian vortex equations on an appropriate
power of the canonical bundle. On the cone over a surface of genus at least two
carrying an Einstein AH structure there are Monge-Amp\`ere metrics of
Lorentzian and Riemannian signature and a Riemannian Einstein K\""ahler affine

magnetized, low-density medium, thus modeling an ambient IGM. The simulations
include radiative cooling and a model for star formation and supernova
feedback. The progenitor disks have initial magnetic seed fields in the range
of 10e-9 to 10e-6 G and the IGM has initial fields of 10e-12 to 10e-9 G. The
simulations are compared to a run excluding magnetic fields. We show that the
propagation of interaction-driven shocks depends significantly on the initial
magnetic field strength. The shocks propagate faster in simulations with
stronger initial field, suggesting that the shocks are supported by magnetic
pressure. The Mach numbers of the shocks range from approximately M=1.5 for the
non-magnetized case up to M=6 for the highest initial magnetization, resulting
in higher temperatures of the shock heated IGM gas. The magnetic field in the
system saturates rapidly after the mergers at ~ 10e-6 G within the galaxies and
~ 10e-8 G in the IGM independent of the initial value. These field strengths
agree with observed values and correspond to the equipartition value of the
magnetic pressure with the turbulent pressure in the system. We also present
synthetic radio and polarization maps for different phases of the evolution
showing that shocks driven by the interaction produce a high amount of
polarized emission. These idealized simulations indicate that magnetic fields
play an important role for the hydrodynamics of the IGM during galactic
interactions. We also show that even weak seed fields are efficiently
strengthened during multiple galactic mergers. This interaction driven
amplification might have been a key process for the magnetization of the

value of the systems through, for example, introduction of new devices and only
a software update of the access points or base stations, without incurring
additional cost for infrastructure hardware installation. The place to look for
such an opportunity is the communication protocol and we use the term *protocol

freedom available when one needs to decide the actions taken by a particular
communication protocol. In this paper we consider protocol coding that gives a
rise to *secondary communication channels*, defined by combinatorial ordering
of the user resources (packets, channels) in a primary (legacy) communication

capacity of such secondary channels under suitable restrictions imposed by the
primary systems. We first show the relation to the capacity of channels with
causal channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), originally
considered by Shannon. By using the specific communication setup, we develop an
alternative framework for achieving the capacity and we discuss coding
strategies that need to be used over the secondary channels. We also discuss
some practical features of the secondary channels and their applications that
add value to the existing wireless systems.

radii comparable to the mean radius of local ones and of compact ETGs having
effective radii from two to six times smaller. We do not find evidence of a
dependence of the compactness of ETGs on their stellar mass. We find that the
stellar mass of normal ETGs formed at z_form<3 while the stellar content of
compact ETGs formed at 2<z_form<10 with a large fraction of them characterized
by z_form>5. Earlier stars formed at z_form>5 are assembled in compact and more
massive (M_*>10^11 M_sun) ETGs while stars later formed (z_form<3) or resulting
from subsequent episodes of star formation are assembled both in compact and
normal ETGs. Thus, the older the stellar population the higher the mass of the
hosting galaxy but not vice versa. This suggests that the epoch of formation
may play a role in the formation of massive ETGs rather than the mass itself.
The possible general scheme in which normal <z>~1.5 ETGs are descendants of
high-z compact spheroids enlarged through subsequent dry mergers is not
compatible with the current models which predict a number of dry mergers two
orders of magnitude lower than the one needed. Moreover, we do not find
evidence supporting a dependence of the compactness of galaxies on their
redshift of assembly. Finally, we propose a simple scheme of formation and
assembly of the stellar mass of ETGs based on dissipative gas-rich merger which
can qualitatively account for the co-existence of normal and compact ETGs
observed at <z>~1.5 in spite of the same stellar mass, the lack of normal ETGs
with high z_form and the absence of correlation between compactness, stellar
mass and formation redshift.

Singlet-triplet and intra-triplet modes demonstrate a doublet structure which
is due to two maxima in the density of magnon states in the low-frequency
range. A joint analysis of the observed spectra and other experimental results
allows to test the applicability of the fermionic and bosonic models. We
conclude that the fermionic approach is more appropriate for the particular

string-theory moduli space and related to the D-instanton chemical potentials.
They not only represent non-perturbative information but also play an important
role in connecting various perturbative string theories in the moduli space.
They are a key concept to the non-perturbative completion of string theory and
also expected to imply some remnant of strong coupling dynamics in M theory. In
this paper, we investigate the non-perturbative completion problem consisting
of two constraints on the Stokes multipliers. As the first constraint, Stokes
phenomena which realize the multi-cut geometry are studied in the Z_k symmetric
critical points of the multi-cut two-matrix models. Sequence of solutions to
the constraints are obtained in general k-cut critical points. A discrete set
of solutions and a continuum set of solutions are explicitly shown, and they
can be classified by several constrained configurations of the Young diagram.
As the second constraint, we discuss non-perturbative stability of backgrounds
in terms of the Riemann-Hilbert problem. In particular, our procedure in the
2-cut (1,2) case (pure-supergravity case) completely fixes the D-instanton
chemical potentials and results in the Hastings-McLeod solution to the
Painlev\'e II equation. It is also stressed that the Riemann-Hilbert approach
realizes an off-shell background independent formulation of non-critical string
theory.

idea that spacetime geometry and gravity are derivative concepts and only apply

of general relativity and emergence. Second, the lack of a fundamental
spacetime makes difficult the straightforward application of well-known methods
of statistical physics to the problem. We recently initiated a study of such
problems using spin systems based on evolution of quantum networks with no a
priori geometric notions as models for emergent geometry and gravity. In this
article we review two such models. The first is a model of emergent (flat)
space and matter and we show how to use methods from quantum information theory
to derive features such as speed of light from a non-geometric quantum system.
The second model exhibits interacting matter and geometry, with the geometry
defined by the behavior of matter. This model has primitive notions of
gravitational attraction which we illustrate with a toy black hole, and
exhibits entanglement between matter and geometry and thermalization of the
quantum geometry.

P(E),P(Ell), P(S0),P(Sab), P(Scd), we select the nearby large late-type spiral
galaxies which have redshifts of 0<=z<=0.02, probabilities of P(Scd)>=0.5 and
angular sizes of D>=7.92 arcsec. The spin axes of the selected nearby large
late-type spiral galaxies are determined up to the two-fold ambiguity with the
help of the circular thin-disk approximation and their spatial correlations are
measured as a function of the separation distance r. A clear signal of the
intrinsic correlation as high as 3.4 sigma and 2.4 sigma is found at the
separation distance of r~1Mpc/h and r~2Mpc/h, respectively. The comparison of
this observational results with the analytic model based on the tidal torque
theory reveals that the spin correlation function for the late-type spiral
galaxies follow the quadratic scaling of the linear density correlation and
that the intrinsic correlations of the galaxy spin axes are stronger than that
of the underlying dark halos. We investigate a local density dependence of the
galaxy spin correlations and found that the correlations are stronger for the
galaxies located in dense regions having more than 10 neighbors within 2Mpc/h.
We also attempt to measure a luminosity dependence of the galaxy spin
correlations, but find that it is impossible with our magnitude-split samples

To determine the credentials of nine candidate intermediate polars in

  Methods. Frequency analysis of RXTE and XMM data was used to search for
temporal variations which could be associated with the spin period of the
magnetic white dwarf. X-ray spectral analysis was carried out to characterise
the emission and absorption properties of each target.
  Results. The hard X-ray light curve of V2069 Cyg shows a pulse period of
743.2 s, and its spectrum is fit by an absorbed bremsstrahlung model with an
iron line, confirming this to be a genuine intermediate polar. The hard X-ray
light curve of the previously confirmed intermediate polar IGR J00234+6141 is
shown to be consistent with the previous low energy X-ray detection of a 563.5
s pulse period. The likely polar IGR J14536-5522 shows no coherent modulation

asymmetry in the universe within the {\it spin-charge-family-theory} if
assuming that transitions in non equilibrium processes among instanton vacua
and complex phases in mixing matrices are the sources of the matter-antimatter
asymmetry, as studied in the literature for several proposed theories. The {\it
spin-charge-family-theory} is, namely, very promising in showing the right way
beyond the {\it standard model}. It predicts families and their mass matrices,
explaining the origin of the charges and of the gauge fields. It predicts that
there are, after the universe passes through two $SU(2)\times U(1)$ phase
transitions, in which the symmetry breaks from $SO(1,3) \times SU(2) \times
SU(2) \times U(1) \times SU(3)$ first to $SO(1,3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)
\times SU(3)$ and then to $SO(1,3) \times U(1) \times SU(3)$, twice decoupled
four families. The upper four families gain masses in the first phase
transition, while the second four families gain masses at the electroweak
break. To these two breaks of symmetries the scalar non Abelian fields, the
(superposition of the) gauge fields of the operators generating families,
contribute. The lightest of the upper four families is stable (in comparison
with the life of the universe) and is therefore a candidate for constituting
the dark matter. The heaviest of the lower four families should be seen at the
LHC or at somewhat higher energies.

included. Properties of the families are analysed and relations among coherent
contributions of the loop corrections to fermion properties discussed,

appearance of several scalar fields is presented, their properties discussed,
it is explained how these scalar fields can effectively be interpreted as the

homogeneous C abundances in studies that compare the behaviour of light
elements in stars, hosting planets or not. This will bring new arguments to the
discussion of possible anomalies that have been suggested and will contribute
to a better understanding of different planetary formation process. The
photospheric parameters were computed through the excitation potential,
equivalent widths, and ionisation equilibrium of Fe lines selected in the
spectra. C abundances were derived from spectral synthesis applied to prominent
molecular head bands of C_2 Swan (5128 and 5165) and to a C atomic line
(5380.3). The distribution of [C/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] shows no difference in the
behaviour of planet-host stars in comparison with stars for which no planet was
detected, for both dwarf and giant subsamples. This result is in agreement with
the hypothesis of primordial origin for the chemical abundances presently
observed instead of self-enrichment during the planetary system formation and
evolution. Additionally, giants are clearly depleted in [C/Fe] (~0.14 dex) when
compared with dwarfs, which is probably related to evolution-induced mixing of
H-burning products in the envelope of evolved stars. Subgiants, although in
small number, seems to follow the same C abundance distribution as dwarfs. We
also analysed the kinematics of the sample stars that, in majority, are members

tasks in survey astronomy, and a critical starting point for the scientific
exploitation of survey data. For bright sources this classification can be done
with almost complete reliability, but for the numerous sources close to a
survey's detection limit each image encodes only limited morphological
information. In this regime, from which many of the new scientific discoveries
are likely to come, it is vital to utilise all the available information about
a source, both from multiple measurements and also prior knowledge about the
star and galaxy populations. It is also more useful and realistic to provide
classification probabilities than decisive classifications. All these
desiderata can be met by adopting a Bayesian approach to star-galaxy
classification, and we develop a very general formalism for doing so. An
immediate implication of applying Bayes's theorem to this problem is that it is
formally impossible to combine morphological measurements in different bands
without using colour information as well; however we develop several
approximations that disregard colour information as much as possible. The
resultant scheme is applied to data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey
(UKIDSS), and tested by comparing the results to deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Stripe 82 measurements of the same sources. The Bayesian classification
probabilities obtained from the UKIDSS data agree well with the deep SDSS
classifications both overall (a mismatch rate of 0.022, compared to 0.044 for
the UKIDSS pipeline classifier) and close to the UKIDSS detection limit (a
mismatch rate of 0.068 compared to 0.075 for the UKIDSS pipeline classifier).
The Bayesian formalism developed here can be applied to improve the reliability
of any star-galaxy classification schemes based on the measured values of
morphology statistics alone.

emission in a sample of early-type galaxies in the Virgo cluster. These data
allow us to conclude, with some confidence, that the emission at 16 micron in
passive ETGs is stellar in origin, consistent with previous work concluding
that the excess mid-infrared emission comes from the dusty envelopes around
evolved AGB stars. There is little evidence for the mid-infrared emission of an
unresolved central component, as might arise in the presence of a dusty torus
associated with a low-luminosity AGN. We nonetheless find that the 16 micron
emission is more centrally peaked than the near-infrared emission, implying a
radial stellar population gradient. By comparing with independent evidence from
studies at optical wavelengths, we conclude that a metallicity that falls with
increasing radius is the principal driver of the observed gradient. We also
plot the mid-infrared colour-magnitude diagram and combine with similar work on
the Coma cluster to define the colour-magnitude relation for absolute K-band
magnitudes from -26 to -19. Because a correlation between mass and age would
produce a relation with a gradient in the opposite sense to that observed, we
conclude that the relation reflects the fact that passive ETGs of lower mass
also have a lower average metallicity. The colour-magnitude relation is thus
driven by metallicity effects. In contrast to what is found in Coma, we do not
find any objects with anomalously bright 16 micron emission relative to the
colour-magnitude relation. Although there is little overlap in the mass ranges
probed in the two clusters, this may suggest that observable ``rejuvenation''
episodes are limited to intermediate mass objects.

in general the level of azimuthal scatter is found to be about 10 per cent for

detected. These fields have magnitudes between a few hundred G up to a few kG.
In one case, evidence of magnetic braking has been found. We investigate the
effects of magnetic braking on the evolution of rotating ($\upsilon_{\rm
ini}$=200 km s$^{-1}$) 10 M$_\odot$ stellar models at solar metallicity during
the main-sequence (MS) phase. The magnetic braking process is included in our
stellar models according to the formalism deduced from 2D MHD simulations of
magnetic wind confinement by ud-Doula and co-workers. Various assumptions are
made regarding both the magnitude of the magnetic field and of the efficiency
of the angular momentum transport mechanisms in the stellar interior. When
magnetic braking occurs in models with differential rotation, a strong and
rapid mixing is obtained at the surface accompanied by a rapid decrease in the
surface velocity. Such a process might account for some MS stars showing strong
mixing and low surface velocities. When solid-body rotation is imposed in the
interior, the star is slowed down so rapidly that surface enrichments are
smaller than in similar models with no magnetic braking. In both kinds of
models (differentially or uniformly rotating), magnetic braking due to a field
of a few 100 G significantly reduces the angular momentum of the core during
the MS phase. This reduction is much greater in solid-body rotating models.

significant fraction of hydrogen, up to $X_\mathrm{H} \sim 0.45$ (by mass). We
discuss the position of the Galactic center WN stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell

Quintuplet WN stars are similar to late-type WN stars found in the Arches

models reveals that the Quintuplet WN stars should have been initially more
massive than 60\,$M_\odot$. They are about 2.1 to 3.6\,Million years old, and

95-day orbit with a (~ 1Msun) companion poses a challenge to our understanding
of stellar evolution in binary and multiple-star systems. Here we describe
optical and radio observations which rule out most of the scenarios proposed to
explain formation of this system. Radio timing measurements of three
post-Keplerian effects yield the most precise measurement of the mass of a
millisecond pulsar to date: 1.667 +/- 0.021 solar masses (99.7% confidence
limit) (...). Optical spectroscopy of a proposed main sequence counterpart show
that its orbital motion mirrors the pulsar's 95-day orbit; being therefore its
binary companion (...) The optical detection also provides a measurement of the
systemic radial velocity of the binary; this and the proper motion measured
from pulsar timing allow the determination of the systemic 3-D velocity in the
Galaxy. We find that the system is always within 270 pc of the plane of the
Galaxy, but always more than 3 kpc away from the Galactic centre. Thus an
exchange interaction in a dense stellar environment (like a globular cluster or
the Galactic centre) is not likely to be the origin of this system. We suggest
that after the supernova that formed it, the neutron star was in a tight orbit
with a main-sequence star, the present companion was a tertiary farther out.
The neutron star then accreted matter from its evolving inner MS companion,
forming a millisecond pulsar. The former donor star then disappears, either due
to a chaotic 3-body interaction with the outer star (caused by the expansion of
the inner orbit that necessarily results from mass transfer), or in the case of
a very compact inner system, due to ablation/accretion by the newly formed
millisecond pulsar.

between luminosity and metallicity (L_AGN-Z_AGN relation). The origin of this
correlation is not clear. It may result from a relation between the black hole
mass (M_BH) and metallicity, or from a relation between the accretion rate
(L/L_Edd) and metallicity. To investigate the origin of the L_AGN-Z_AGN
relation, we use optical spectra of 2383 quasars at 2.3 < z < 3.0 from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. By using this data set, we have constructed composite
spectra of 33 subsamples in intervals of both M_BH and L/L_Edd. From these
composite spectra we measure emission-line flux ratios that are sensitive to
the metallicity of the broad line region (BLR); specifically, NV/CIV, NV/HeII,
(SiIV+OIV])/CIV, and AlIII/CIV. We find that there is a significant correlation
between M_BH and Z_BLR as inferred from all four metallicity-sensitive
emission-line flux ratios. This result strongly suggests that the observed
L_AGN-Z_AGN relation is mostly a consequence of the M_BH-Z_AGN relation. The
relation between M_BH and Z_BLR is likely a consequence of both the M_BH-M_bul
relation and of the mass-metallicity relation in the host galaxy. We also find
that L/L_Edd correlates with the emission line flux ratios involving NV (more
specifically, NV/CIV and NV/HeII), while it does not correlate with the other
two metallicity sensitive emission line flux ratios, i.e., (SiIV+OIV])/CIV and
AlIII/CIV. These correlations indicate that the emission-line flux ratios
involving NV depend on both metallicity and relative abundance of nitrogen. We
suggest that the relation between L/L_Edd and those line ratios involving
nitrogen, is caused by a delay of the black hole accretion rate relative to the
onset of nuclear star formation of about 10^8 years, which is the timescale
required for the nitrogen enrichment.

$M_\odot$. 7.5% of the A and B stars possess infrared excesses in a variety of
morphologies that suggest their disks are in some transitional phase between an
initial, optically thick accretion state and later evolutionary states. We
identify four morphological classes based on the wavelength dependence of the
observed excess emission above theoretical photospheric levels: (a) the
optically thick disks; (b) disks with an optically thin excess over the
wavelength range 2 to 24 $\micron$, similar to that shown by Classical Be
stars; (c) disks that are optically thin in their inner regions based on their
infrared excess at 2-8 $\micron$ and optically thick in their outer regions

disks that exhibit empty inner regions (no excess emission at $\lambda$ $\leq$

of disks exhibit no significant excess emission at $\lambda \leq$ 5.8

for even $t$, we give an explicit method to construct all of them. This gives
us a many explicit example of Frobenius codes which include the well studied

correct quantum errors within the BCH limit. This gives, for the first time, a

virial estimate of black hole masses with that derived from the mass of the

the projection of the velocity of line-emitting clouds along the line of sight;
the latter is not. This comparison allows us to constrain the deprojection
factor f, thus revealing general properties of the geometry of the broad line
region. We show that blazars tend to have 1) higher f values than the quasars

and <f_{quasars}>=2.0 +/- 0.3; 2) relatively narrow broad emission lines; 3)
modest equivalent widths, as expected because of the occurrence of jet emission
at very low inclination angles. In a disc-like sketch of the broad line region,
these results indicate a pole-on view of a flat geometry in blazars. This
consistently extends the orientation--dependent unified model of active nuclei

theory which in principle may contain higher dimensional non-renormalizable
operators. These operators may modify the standard model Higgs potential in
many ways, one of which being the appearance of a second vacuum. For a wide
range of parameters, this new vacuum becomes the true vacuum. It is then
assumed that our universe is currently sitting in the false vacuum. Thus the
usual second-order electroweak phase transition at early times will be followed
by a second, first-order phase transition. In cosmology, a first-order phase
transition is associated with the production of gravity waves. In this paper we
present an analysis of the production of gravitational waves during such a
second electroweak phase transition. We find that, for one certain range of
parameters, the stochastic background of gravitational waves generated by
bubble nucleation and collision have an amplitude which is estimated to be of
order $\Omega_{GW}h^2\sim10^{-11}$ at $f=3\times 10^{-4}$Hz, which is within
reach of the planned sensitivity of LISA. For another range of parameters, we
find that the amplitude is estimated o be of order $\Omega_{GW}h^2\sim10^{-25}$
around $f=10^3$Hz, which is within reach of LIGO. Hence, it is possible to
detect gravity waves from such a phase transition at two different detectors,

edge Laplacians} on the edges of a graph. The family includes a canonical edge
Laplacian associated to the graph, extending the usual graph Laplacian on
vertices, and we find its spectrum. We show that for a connected graph its
eigenvalues are strictly positive aside from one mandatory zero mode, and
include all the vertex degrees. Our edge Laplacian is not the graph Laplacian
on the line graph but rather it arises as the noncommutative Laplace-Beltrami
operator on differential 1-forms, where we use the language of differential
algebras to functorially interpret a graph as providing a `finite manifold
structure' on the set of vertices. We equip any graph with a canonical
`Euclidean metric' and a canonical bimodule connection, and in the case of a
Cayley graph we construct a metric compatible connection for the Euclidean
metric. We make use of results on bimodule connections on inner calculi on
algebras, which we prove, including a general relation between zero curvature
and the braid relations.

theory is described by almost free fermions, and weak coupling where the theory
is described by bosonic fields by an analysis of spectra and correlators. The
AdS$_3$ dual is described, and several quantitative checks are performed.
Besides the more standard states that should correspond to bulk black holes we
find ground states with large degeneracy that can dominate the standard Cardy
entropy at weak coupling and are expected to correspond to regular horizonless
semiclassical bulk solutions.

initially entangled qubits which are subjected to frequent measurements via
decoherent coupling with independent reservoirs. The links between
characteristic parameters such as system bias, measurement time duration,
strength of initial entanglement between the two qubit systems and the dynamics
of quantum discord are examined in the case of two initial state
configurations. For weak or unsharp measurements, the quantum discord, which is
an intrinsically distinct entity from concurrence, serves as a reliable
indicator of the crossover point in Zeno to anti-Zeno transitions. However at
highly precise quantum measurements, the monitoring device interferes
significantly with the evolution dynamics of the monitored system, and the
quantum discord yields indeterminate values in a reference frame where the
observer is not an active constituent of the subsystems.
