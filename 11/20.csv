secure communication. However, guaranteeing that the output from a candidate
random source could not have been predicted by an outside party is a
challenging task, and many supposedly random sources used today provide no such
guarantee. Quantum solutions to this problem exist, for example a device which
internally sends a photon through a beam-splitter and observes on which side it
emerges, but, presently, such solutions require the user to trust the internal
workings of the device. Here we seek to go beyond this limitation by asking
whether randomness can be generated using untrusted devices---even ones created
by an adversarial agent---while providing a guarantee that no outside party
(including the agent) can predict it. Since this is easily seen to be
impossible unless the user has an initially private random string, the task we
investigate here is private randomness expansion.
  We introduce a protocol for private randomness expansion with untrusted
devices which is designed to take as input an initially private random string
and produce as output a longer private random string. We point out that private
randomness expansion protocols are generally vulnerable to attacks that can
render the initial string partially insecure, even though that string is used
only inside a secure laboratory; our protocol is designed to remove this
previously unconsidered vulnerability by privacy amplification. We also discuss
extensions of our protocol designed to generate an arbitrarily long random
string from a finite initially private random string. The security of these
protocols against the most general attacks is left as an open question.

Matsubara frequency quantities or calculating multi-dimensional integrals,
while taking full account of the very sharp structures in the Green's functions
that arise close to the Mott transitions and in the Mott insulator regime. We
demonstrate its viability for the half-filled Hubbard model. Previous known
results are reproduced within the present approach. The universal behavior of
the spectral functions in the Fermi liquid regime is emphasized, and adiabatic
continuity to the non-interacting limit is demonstrated. The dc resistivity in
the metallic regime is known to be a non-monotonic function of temperature with
a `coherence peak'. This feature is shown to be a universal feature occurring
at a temperature roughly equal to the low energy scale of the system. A
comparison to pressure dependent dc resistivity experiments on Selenium doped
NiS$_2$ yields qualitatively good agreement. Resistivity hysteresis across the
Mott transition is shown to be described qualitatively within the present
framework. A direct comparison of the thermal hysteresis observed in V$_2$O$_3$

is a fully micro-realistic version of quantum theory that provides us with a
very natural possible solution to the fundamental wave/particle problem, and is
free of the severe defects of orthodox quantum theory (OQT) as a result. PQT
makes sense of the quantum world. PQT recovers all the empirical success of OQT
and is, furthermore, empirically testable (although not as yet tested). I argue
that Einstein almost put forward this version of quantum theory in 1916/17 in
his papers on spontaneous and induced radiative transitions, but retreated from
doing so because he disliked the probabilistic character of the idea.
Subsequently, the idea was overlooked because debates about quantum theory
polarised into the Bohr/Heisenberg camp, which argued for the abandonment of
realism and determinism, and the Einstein/Schr\""odinger camp, which argued for
the retention of realism and determinism, no one, as a result, pursuing the
most obvious option of retaining realism but abandoning determinism. It is this
third, overlooked option that leads to PQT. PQT has implications for quantum
field theory, the standard model, string theory, and cosmology. The really

high-energy gamma-ray emission from the gamma-ray binary LS I +61 303 during

bands has its origin in a single particle population. We aim at improving our
understanding of the source behaviour by explaining the simultaneous X-ray and
VHE data through a radiation model. We use a model based on a one zone
population of relativistic leptonic particles assuming dominant adiabatic
losses located at the position of the compact object. The adiabatic cooling
timescale is inferred from the X-ray fluxes. The model can reproduce the
spectra and lightcurves in the X-ray and VHE bands. Adiabatic losses could be
the key ingredient to explain the X-ray and partially the VHE lightcurves. From
the best fit result, we obtain a magnetic field of B=0.2 G, a minimum
luminosity budget of ~2x10^35 erg/s and a relatively high acceleration
efficiency. In addition, our results seem to confirm that the GeV emission
detected by Fermi does not come from the same parent particle population as the
X-ray and VHE emission and the Fermi spectrum poses a constraint on the
hardness of the particle spectrum at lower energies. In the context of our
scenario, more sensitive observations would allow to constrain the inclination
angle, which could determine the nature of the compact object.

of the degenerate operator. A special attention is devoted to representation of
conformal block through the beta-ensemble resolvents and to its asymptotics in
the limit of large dimensions (both external and intermediate) taken
asymmetrically in terms of the deformation epsilon-parameters. The
next-to-leading term in the asymptotics defines the generating differential in
the Bohr-Sommerfeld representation of the one-parameter deformed Seiberg-Witten
prepotentials (whose full two-parameter deformation leads to Nekrasov
functions). This generating differential is also shown to be the one-parameter
version of the single-point resolvent for the corresponding beta-ensemble, and
its periods in the perturbative limit of the gauge theory are expressed through
the ratios of the Harish-Chandra function. The Shr\""odinger/Baxter equations,
considered earlier in this context, directly follow from the differential
equations for the degenerate conformal block. This provides a powerful method
for evaluation of the single-deformed prepotentials, and even for the
Seiberg-Witten prepotentials themselves. We mostly concentrate on the
representative case of the insertion into the four-point block on sphere and
one-point block on torus.

Point-vortex dynamics are described by a relatively simple system of nonlinear
ODEs which can easily be integrated numerically using an appropriate adaptive
time stepping method. As the separation between a pair of vortices relative to
all other inter-vortex length scales decreases, however, the computational time
required diverges. Accuracy is usually the most discouraging casualty when
trying to account for such vortex motion, though the varying energy of this
ostensibly Hamiltonian system is a potentially more serious problem. We solve
these problems by a series of coordinate transformations: We first transform to
action-angle coordinates, which, to lowest order, treat the close pair as a
single vortex amongst all others with an internal degree of freedom. We next,
and most importantly, apply Lie transform perturbation theory to remove the
higher-order correction terms in succession. The overall transformation
drastically increases the numerical efficiency and ensures that the total

""short-lived"" genera. The difference between the evolutionary dynamics of these
2 genera classes indicates that the periodic pattern is not an artifact of
variation in quality of the geologic record. The interplay of these two
previously undifferentiated systems, together with the secular increase in
abundance of ""long-lived"" genera, is probably the source of heretofore
unexplained differences in evolutionary dynamics between the Paleozoic and
post-Paleozoic as reported by others. Testing for cycles similar to the 62 Myr
cycle in fossil biodiversity superimposed on the long-term trends of the
Phanerozoic as described in Paper I, we find a significant (but weaker) signal

connection. The presence of a periodic pattern in evolutionary dynamics of the
vulnerable ""short-lived"" component of marine fauna demonstrates that a
long-term periodic fluctuation in environmental conditions capable of affecting
evolution in the marine realm characterizes our planet. Coincidence in timing
is more consistent with a common cause than sampling bias. A previously
identified set of mass extinctions preferentially occur during the declining
phase of the 62 Myr periodicity, supporting the idea that the periodicity
relates to variation in biotically important stresses. Further work should
focus on finding links to physical phenomena that might reveal the causal

gravitational lensing systems rely on the cross-correlation of the light curves
of the individual images. In this paper, we use 300 MeV-30 GeV photons detected
by the Fermi-LAT instrument. The Fermi-LAT instrument cannot separate the
images of known lenses. The observed light curve is thus the superposition of
individual image light curves. The Fermi-LAT instrument has the advantage of
providing long, evenly spaced, time series. In addition, the photon noise level
is very low. This allows to use directly Fourier transform methods. Results. A

tight dependence of metallicity on mass and SFR recently discovered for SDSS

masses below this limit, the FMR can only be used after an extension towards
lower masses. At this aim, we study the FMR for galaxies with masses down to
~10^8.3 Msun, finding that the FMR does extend smoothly at lower masses, albeit
with a much larger scatter. We then compare the resulting FMR with the
metallicity properties of 18 host galaxies of long GRBs. While the GRB hosts
show a systematic offset with respect to the mass-metallicity relation, they
are fully consistent with the FMR. This shows that the difference with the
mass-metallicity relation is due to higher than average SFRs, and that GRBs
with optical afterglows do not preferentially select low-metallicity hosts
among the star-forming galaxies. The apparent low metallicity is therefore a
consequence of the occurrence of long GRB in low mass, actively star-forming
galaxies, known to dominate the current cosmic SFR.

to show that their intrinsic color is correlated with their ejecta velocity, as
measured from the blueshift of the Si II 6355 feature near maximum brightness,
v_Si. The SN Ia sample was originally used by Wang et al. (2009) to show that
the relationship between color excess and peak magnitude, which in the absence
of intrinsic color differences describes a reddening law, was different for two
subsamples split by v_Si (defined as ""Normal"" and ""High-Velocity""). We verify
this result, but find that the two subsamples have the same reddening law when
extremely reddened events (E(B-V) > 0.35 mag) are excluded. We also show that
(1) the High-Velocity subsample is offset by ~0.06 mag to the red from the
Normal subsample in the (B_max - V_max) - M_V plane, (2) the B_max - V_max
cumulative distribution functions of the two subsamples have nearly identical
shapes, but the High-Velocity subsample is offset by ~0.07 mag to the red in
B_max - V_max, and (3) the bluest High-Velocity SNe Ia are ~0.10 mag redder
than the bluest Normal SNe Ia. Together, this evidence indicates a difference
in intrinsic color for the subsamples. Accounting for this intrinsic color
difference reduces the scatter in Hubble residuals from 0.190 mag to 0.130 mag
for SNe Ia with A_V < 0.7 mag. The scatter can be further reduced to 0.109 mag
by exclusively using SNe Ia from the Normal subsample. Additionally, this
result can at least partially explain the anomalously low values of R_V found
in large SN Ia samples. We explain the correlation between ejecta velocity and
color as increased line blanketing in the High-Velocity SNe Ia, causing them to
become redder. We discuss some implications of this result, and stress the
importance of spectroscopy for future SN Ia cosmology surveys, with particular
focus on the design of WFIRST.

dust obscuration geometry on the AGN type. We define control samples of non-AGN

extinction and reddening. Assuming that AGN galaxies have the same underlying
three-dimensional shape distribution as their corresponding control samples, we
find that the spiral and elliptical type I AGN populations are strongly skewed
toward face-on galaxies, while ellipticals and spirals type II AGN are skewed
toward edge-on orientations. These findings rule out random orientations for
AGN hosts at high confidence for type I spirals (delta chi^2~230) and type II
ellipticals (delta chi^2~15), while the signal for type I ellipticals and type

revealed a flux of gamma rays concentrated around the inner ~0.5 degrees of the
Milky Way, with a spectrum that is sharply peaked at 2-4 GeV. If interpreted as
the products of annihilating dark matter, this signal implies that the dark
matter consists of particles with a mass between 7.3 and 9.2 GeV annihilating
primarily to charged leptons. This mass range is very similar to that required
to accommodate the signals reported by CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA. In addition to
gamma rays, the dark matter is predicted to produce energetic electrons and
positrons in the Inner Galaxy, which emit synchrotron photons as a result of
their interaction with the galactic magnetic field. In this letter, we
calculate the flux and spectrum of this synchrotron emission assuming that the
gamma rays from the Galactic Center originate from dark matter, and compare the
results to measurements from the WMAP satellite. We find that a sizable flux of
hard synchrotron emission is predicted in this scenario, and that this can
easily account for the observed intensity, spectrum, and morphology of the

flux of high energy cosmic rays (HECRs) from astrophysical sources such as
nearby supernovae, gamma ray bursts or by galactic shocks. Typical cosmic ray
energies may be much higher than the ~ 1 GeV flux which normally dominates.
These high-energy particles strike the Earth's atmosphere initiating an
extensive air shower. As the air shower propagates deeper, it ionizes the
atmosphere by producing charged secondary particles. Secondary particles such
as muons and thermal neutrons produced as a result of nuclear interactions are
able to reach the ground, enhancing the radiation dose. Muons contribute 85% to
the radiation dose from cosmic rays. This enhanced dose could be potentially
harmful to the biosphere. This mechanism has been discussed extensively in
literature but has never been quantified. Here, we have developed a lookup

flux from any arbitrary cosmic ray spectra with 10 GeV - 1 PeV primaries. This
will enable us to compute the radiation dose on terrestrial planetary surfaces

explore the possibility of also utilizing the subdominant but very distinctive

mistag rates of order 0.1%-0.01% for p_T TeV, even in the presence of pileup.
We further demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing the ditau invariant

estimate the sensitivity of the LHC for discovery of a multi-TeV Z' decaying to

relation between the electric field component $E_\parallel({\bf r}, t)$ and its
source $\rho({\bf r}, t)$ that is instantaneous, occurring at the same time
$t$. This instantaneous action at a distance can be hidden by writing it
formally as the sum of two causal terms. I show here that the causal expression
of the total electric field ${\bf E}$ suffers from such a spurious causality
hiding the action at a distance that is $E_\parallel$. In fact, $E_\parallel$
remains instantaneous in time even when it is part of a wave equation. Only the
${\bf E}_\perp$ part is really causal.

ground-state densities that are not pure-state v-representable in the
non-interacting reference system (PSVR) occur frequently. In the present
contribution, a new algorithm, which allows the solution of such systems, is
proposed. It is shown that the use of densities which do not correspond to a
ground state of their non-interacting reference system is forbidden. As a
consequence, the proposed algorithm considers only non-interacting ensemble
v-representable densities. The Fe atom, a well-known non-PSVR system, is used
as an illustration. Finally, the problem is analyzed within finite temperature
density-functional theory, where the physical significance of fractional
occupations is exposed and the question of why degenerate states can be

these anomalies, extensive neutron diffraction measurements of liquid Bi and Sb
were carried out over a wide temperature range. The structure factors of liquid
Sb and Bi were determined as a function of temperature. The structure of the
two molten metals was carefully analyzed with respect to peak locations, widths
and coordination number in their respective radial distribution function. The
width of the peaks in the radial distribution function were not found to
increase and even decreased within a certain temperature range. This anomalous
temperature dependence of the peak widths correlates with the anomalous
temperature dependence of the sound velocity. This correlation may be accounted
for by increasing rigidity of the liquid structure with temperature. A
phenomenological correlation between the peak width and the sound velocity is
suggested for metallic melts and is found to agree with available data for
normal and anomalous elemental liquids in groups IV-VI.

(xc) energy in density-functional theory. Atoms and ions for which the

developed algorithm which searches over ensemble v-representable densities [E.

It is found that for many atoms the ionization energies obtained with the GGA
are only modestly improved with respect to experimental data, as compared to
the LSDA. However, even in those groups of atoms where the improvement is
systematic, there remains a non-negligible difference with respect to the
experiment. The ab-initio electronic configuration in the Kohn-Sham reference
system does not always equal the configuration obtained from the spectroscopic
term within the independent-electron approximation. It was shown that use of
the latter configuration can prevent the energy-minimization process from
converging to the global minimum, e.g. in lanthanides. The spin values
calculated ab-initio fit the experiment for most atoms and are almost
unaffected by the choice of the xc-functional. Among the systems with
incorrectly obtained spin there exist some cases (e.g. V, Pt) for which the
result is found to be stable with respect to small variations in the

for a rotation around the galactic center by 180{\deg} (a two-arm pattern) or
by 90{\deg} (a four-arm pattern). We demonstrate that, for the inner region,
the observations are best represented with a four-arm scheme of the spiral
pattern, associated with all-Galaxy spiral density waves. The basic position is
that of the Carina arm, reliably determined from distances to HII regions and
from HI and H2 radial velocities. This pattern is continued in the quadrants
III and IV with weak outer HI arms; from their morphology, the Galaxy should be
considered an asymmetric multi-arm spiral. The kneed shape of the outer arms
that consist of straight segments can indicate that these arms are transient
formations that appeared due to a gravitational instability in the gas disk.
The distances between HI superclouds in the two arms that are the brightest in
neutral hydrogen, the Carina arm and the Cygnus (Outer) arm, concentrate to two
values, permitting to assume the presence of a regular magnetic field in these

state a number of conjectures suggesting that the representation theory of
symplectic reflection algebras for wreath products categorifies certain
structures in the representation theory of affine Lie algebras (namely,
decompositions of the restriction of the basic representation to finite
dimensional and affine subalgebras). These conjectures arose from the insight
due to R. Bezrukavnikov and A. Okounkov on the link between quantum connections
for Hilbert schemes of resolutions of Kleinian singularities and
representations of symplectic reflection algebras.

to Dirac neutrinos, in a minimal way, then neutrino-anti-neutrino clouds of
sufficient number density can experience an instability in which helicities are
suddenly reversed. The predicted collective evolution is many orders of
magnitude faster than given by cross-section calculations. The instabilities
are the analogue of the ``flavor-angle"" instabilities (enabled by the Z
exchange force) that may drive very rapid flavor exchange among the neutrinos
that emerge from a supernova. These exchanges do require a tiny seed in
addition to the scalar couplings, but the transition time is proportional to
the negative of the logarithm of the seed strength, so that the size of this
parameter is comparatively unimportant. For our actual estimates we use a tiny
non-conservation of leptons; an alternative would be a neutrino magnetic moment
in a small magnetic field. The possibility of a quantum fluctuation as a seed
is also discussed. Operating in the mode of putting limits on the coupling
constant of the scalar field, for the most minimal coupling scheme, with
independent couplings to all three $\nu$, we find a rough limit on the
dimensionless coupling constant for a neutrino-flavor independent coupling of
$G<10^{-10}$, to avoid the effective number of light neutrinos in the early
universe being essentially six. If, on the other hand, we wish to fine-tune the
model to give a more modest excess (over three) in the effective neutrino
number, as may be needed according to recent WMAP analyses, it is easy to do
so.

  the Standard Model?""",,,,"astro-ph.CO hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The nonbaryonic dark matter of the Universe is assumed to consist of new
stable particles. A specific case is possible, when new stable particles bear
ordinary electric charge and bind in heavy ""atoms"" by ordinary Coulomb
interaction. Such possibility is severely restricted by the constraints on
anomalous isotopes of light elements that form positively charged heavy species
with ordinary electrons. The trouble is avoided, if stable particles $X^{--}$
with charge -2 are in excess over their antiparticles (with charge +2) and
there are no stable particles with charges +1 and -1. Then primordial helium,
formed in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, captures all $X^{--}$ in neutral ""atoms"" of
O-helium (OHe). Schrodinger equation for system of nucleus and OHe is
considered and reduced to an equation of relative motion in a spherically
symmetrical potential, formed by the Yukawa tail of nuclear scalar isoscalar
attraction potential, acting on He beyond the nucleus, and dipole Coulomb
repulsion between the nucleus and OHe at small distances between nuclear
surfaces of He and nucleus. The values of coupling strength and mass of
$\sigma$-meson, mediating scalar isoscalar nuclear potential, are rather
uncertain. Within these uncertainties and in the approximation of rectangular
potential wells and wall we find a range of these parameters, at which the
sodium nuclei have a few keV binding energy with OHe. The result also strongly
depend on the precise value of parameter $d_o$ that determines the size of
nuclei. At nuclear parameters, reproducing DAMA results, OHe-nucleus bound
states can exist only for intermediate nuclei, thus excluding direct comparison
with these results in detectors, containing very light (e.g. $^3He$) and heavy
nuclei (like Xe).

DAMA/LIBRA confronted with results of other groups can imply nontrivial
particle physics solutions for cosmological dark matter. Stable particles with
charge -2, bound with primordial helium in O-helium ""atoms"" (OHe), represent a
specific nuclear-interacting form of dark matter. Slowed down in the
terrestrial matter, OHe is elusive for direct methods of underground Dark
matter detection using its nuclear recoil. However, low energy binding of OHe
with sodium nuclei can lead to annual variations of energy release from OHe
radiative capture in the interval of energy 2-4 keV in DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA
experiments. At nuclear parameters, reproducing DAMA results, the energy
release predicted for detectors with chemical content other than NaI differ in
the most cases from the one in DAMA detector. Moreover there is no bound
systems of OHe with light and heavy nuclei, so that there is no radiative
capture of OHe in detectors with xenon or helium content. Due to dipole Coulomb
barrier, transitions to more energetic levels of Na+OHe system with much higher
energy release are suppressed in the correspondence with the results of DAMA
experiments. The proposed explanation inevitably leads to prediction of
abundance of anomalous Na, corresponding to the signal, observed by DAMA.
