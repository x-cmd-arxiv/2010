form solutions in two formulations of the multiple disorder problem for an
observable Brownian motion with switching constant drift rates. The method of

most successful to date. The RV signal imprinted by a few Earth-mass planet
around a cool star is at the limit of the typical single measurement
uncertainty obtained using state-of-the-art spectrographs. This requires
relying on statistics in order to unearth signals buried below noise. Artifacts
introduced by observing cadences can produce spurious signals or mask genuine
planets that should be easily detected otherwise. Here we discuss a
particularly confusing statistical degeneracy resulting from the yearly
aliasing of the first eccentric harmonic of an already-detected planet. This
problem came sharply into focus after the recent announcement of the detection
of a 3.1 Earth mass planet candidate in the habitable zone of the nearby low
mass star GJ 581. The orbital period of the new candidate planet (GJ 581g)
corresponds to an alias of the first eccentric harmonic of a previously
reported planet, GJ 581d. Although the star is stable, the combination of the
observing cadence and the presence of multiple planets can cause period
misinterpretations. In this work, we determine whether the detection of GJ 581g
is justified given this degeneracy. We also discuss the implications of our
analysis for the recent Bayesian studies of the same data set, which failed to
confirm the existence of the new planet. Performing a number of statistical
tests, we show that, despite some caveats, the existence of GJ 581g remains the
most likely orbital solution to the currently available RV data.

coagulation from micron to millimeter sizes in circumstellar disks. For the
first time, we collect and compile the recent laboratory experiments on dust
aggregates into a collision model that can be implemented into dust coagulation
models. We put this model into a Monte Carlo code that uses representative
particles to simulate dust evolution. Simulations are performed using three
different disk models in a local box (0D) located at 1 AU distance from the
central star. We find that the dust evolution does not follow the previously
assumed growth-fragmentation cycle, but growth is halted by bouncing before the
fragmentation regime is reached. We call this the bouncing barrier which is an
additional obstacle during the already complex formation process of
planetesimals. The absence of the growth-fragmentation cycle and the halted
growth has two important consequences for planet formation. 1) It is observed
that disk atmospheres are dusty throughout their lifetime. Previous models
concluded that the small, continuously produced fragments can keep the disk
atmospheres dusty. We however show that small fragments are not produced
because bouncing prevents fragmentation. 2) As particles do not reach the
fragmentation barrier, their sizes are smaller compared to the sizes reached in
previous dust models. We decided to investigate point 1) in more detail. A
vertical column of a disk (1D) is modeled including the sedimentation of the
particles. We find that already intermediate levels of turbulence can prevent
particles settling to the midplane.

protoplanets form, while most of the initial mass remains in small
planetesimals. The amount of mass converted into large protoplanets and their
resulting size distribution are not well understood. Here, we use analytic
work, that we confirm by coagulation simulations, to describe runaway growth
and the corresponding evolution of the velocity dispersion. We find that
runaway growth proceeds as follows: Initially all the mass resides in small
planetesimals, with mass surface density \sigma, and large protoplanets start
to form by accreting small planetesimals. This growth continues until growth by
merging large protoplanets becomes comparable to growth by planetesimal
accretion. This condition sets in when \Sigma/\sigma ~\alpha^{3/4} ~ 10^{-3},
where \Sigma is the mass surface density in protoplanets in a given logarithmic
mass interval and \alpha is the ratio of the size of a body to its Hill radius.
From then on, protoplanetary growth and the evolution of the velocity
dispersion become self-similar and \Sigma remains roughly constant, since an
increase in \Sigma by accretion of small planetesimals is balanced by a
decrease due to merging with large protoplanets. We show that this growth leads
to a protoplanet size distribution given by N(>R) \propto R^{-3} where N(>R) is
the number of objects with radii greater than R (i.e., a differential power-law
index of 4). We apply our results to the Kuiper Belt, which is a relic of
runaway growth. Our results successfully match the observed Kuiper belt size
distribution, they illuminate the physical processes that shaped it and explain
the total mass that is present in large Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) today. This
work suggests that the current mass in large KBOs is primordial and that it has
not been significantly depleted. Abridged

iv) accelerate the primary electrons which provide the extended, non-thermal

advected to very large scales (up to ~10 kpc), generate the recently-identified
WMAP haze and corresponding Fermi haze/bubbles. Our modelling bounds the
average magnetic field amplitude in the inner few degrees of the Galaxy to the
range 60 < B/microG < 400 (at 2 sigma confidence) and shows that even TeV CRs
likely do not have time to penetrate into the cores of the region's dense
molecular clouds before the wind removes them from the region. This latter
finding apparently disfavours scenarios in which CRs - in this star-burst-like

convexity of the union of state classes reached by different interleavings of
the same set of transitions. In BB08, the authors have considered the T-TPN

not necessarily convex. They have however established some sufficient
conditions which ensure convexity. This paper shows that for the CSCG of
{P,A}-TPN, this union is convex and can be computed without computing
intermediate state classes. These results allow to improve the forward
reachability analysis by agglomerating, in the same state class, all state
classes reached by different interleavings of the same set of transitions

Unlike Random Matrix Theory, which only predicts the main term, the Ratios
Conjecture detects the arithmetic of the family and makes detailed predictions
about their dependence in the lower order terms. Interestingly, while Random
Matrix Theory is frequently used to model behavior of L-functions (or at least
the main terms), there has been little if any work on the analogue of
convolving families of L-functions by convolving random matrix ensembles. We
explore one possibility by considering Kronecker products; unfortunately, it
appears that this is not the correct random matrix analogue to convolving

directly produce the Hawking emission spectrum and entropy spectroscopy in the
tunneling picture, has been received a broad attention. However, during the
emission process, most related observations have not incorporated the effects
of back reaction on the background spacetime, whose derivations are therefore
not the desiring results for the real physical process. With this point as a
central motivation, in this paper we suitably adapt the \emph{reformulated}
tunneling framework so that it can well accommodate the effects of back
reaction to produce the Hawking emission spectrum and entropy spectroscopy.
Consequently, we interestingly find that, when back reaction is considered, the
Parikh-Wilczek's outstanding observations that, an isolated radiating black
hole has an unitary-evolving emission spectrum that is \emph{not} precisely
thermal, but is related to the change of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, can
also be reproduced in the reformulated tunneling framework, meanwhile the
entropy spectrum has the same form as that without inclusion of back reaction,
which demonstrates the entropy quantum is \emph{independent} of the effects of
back reaction. As our final analysis, we concentrate on the issues of the black
hole information, but \emph{unfortunately} find that, even including the
effects of back reaction and higher-order quantum corrections, such tunneling
formalism can still not provide a mechanism for preserving the black hole
information.

most efficient allocation of conservation resources. Recently, there has been a
growing trend for many governments to supplement public ownership and
management of reserves with incentive programs for conservation on private
land. At the same time, policies to promote conservation on private land are
rarely evaluated in terms of their ecological consequences. This raises
important questions, such as the extent to which private land conservation can
improve conservation outcomes, and how it should be mixed with more traditional
public land conservation. We address these questions, using a general framework
for modelling environmental policies and a case study examining the
conservation of endangered native grasslands to the west of Melbourne,
Australia. Specifically, we examine three policies that involve: i) spending
all resources on creating public conservation areas; ii) spending all resources
on an ongoing incentive program where private landholders are paid to manage
vegetation on their property with 5-year contracts; and iii) splitting
resources between these two approaches. The performance of each strategy is
quantified with a vegetation condition change model that predicts future
changes in grassland quality. Of the policies tested, no one policy was always
best and policy performance depended on the objectives of those enacting the
policy. This work demonstrates a general method for evaluating environmental
policies and highlights the utility of a model which combines ecological and
socioeconomic processes.

to handle systematic mortality risk, which is inherent in life insurance and
annuity contracts. Systematic mortality risk is due to the uncertain
development of future mortality intensities, or {\it hazard rates}. In this
paper, we develop a theory for pricing pure endowments when hedging with a
mortality forward is allowed. The hazard rate associated with the pure
endowment and the reference hazard rate for the mortality forward are
correlated and are modeled by diffusion processes. We price the pure endowment
by assuming that the issuing company hedges its contract with the mortality
forward and requires compensation for the unhedgeable part of the mortality
risk in the form of a pre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio. The major
result of this paper is that the value per contract solves a linear partial
differential equation as the number of contracts approaches infinity. One can
represent the limiting price as an expectation under an equivalent martingale
measure. Another important result is that hedging with the mortality forward
may raise or lower the price of this pure endowment comparing to its price
without hedging, as determined in Bayraktar et al. [2009]. The market price of
the reference mortality risk and the correlation between the two portfolios
jointly determine the cost of hedging. We demonstrate our results using
numerical examples.

correlated equilibria of concisely-represented games. Recently, Stein, Parrilo
and Ozdaglar showed that this algorithm can fail to find an exact correlated
equilibrium, but can be easily modified to efficiently compute approximate
correlated equilibria. Currently, it remains unresolved whether the algorithm
can be modified to compute an exact correlated equilibrium. We show that it
can, presenting a variant of the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm that
guarantees the polynomial-time identification of exact correlated equilibrium.
Our new algorithm differs from the original primarily in its use of a
separation oracle that produces cuts corresponding to pure-strategy profiles.
As a result, we no longer face the numerical precision issues encountered by
the original approach, and both the resulting algorithm and its analysis are
considerably simplified. Our new separation oracle can be understood as a
derandomization of Papadimitriou and Roughgarden's original separation oracle
via the method of conditional probabilities. Also, the equilibria returned by
our algorithm are distributions with polynomial-sized supports, which are
simpler (in the sense of being representable in fewer bits) than the mixtures
of product distributions produced previously; no tractable algorithm has
previously been proposed for identifying such equilibria.

allows a Bogomol'nyi-type inequality for an arbitrary dilaton coupling constant

flat) spacetime admits a nontrivial spinor satisfying the gravitino and the
dilatino Killing spinor equations. The present paper revisits this issue and
argues that the dilatino equation fails to ensure the dilaton field equation
unless the solution is purely electric/magnetic, or the dilaton coupling
constant is given by $\alpha=0, \sqrt 3$, corresponding to the
Brans-Dicke-Maxwell theory and the Kaluza-Klein reduction of 5-dimensional
vacuum gravity, respectively. A systematic classification of the supersymmetric
solutions reveals that the solution can be rotating if and only if the solution
is dyonic or the coupling constant is given by $\alpha=0, \sqrt 3$. This
implies that the theory with $\alpha \ne 0, \sqrt 3$ cannot be embedded into

the operator S is compact, then there exists a family (K_{n})_{n \in N} of
compact subsets of X such that A_{S_{w}} is not connected, for all w \in H-

evolution of galaxies. Recently, we have shown that metallicity of local
galaxies is tightly related not only to stellar mass, but also to star
formation rate (SFR). At low stellar mass, metallicity decreases sharply with
increasing SFR, while at high stellar mass, metallicity does not depend on SFR.
The residual metallicity dispersion across this Fundamental Metallicity
Relation (FMR) is very small, about 0.05dex. High redshift galaxies, up to
z~2.5, are found to follow the same FMR defined by local SDSS galaxies, with no
indication of evolution. At z>2.5, evolution of about 0.6dex off the FMR is
observed, with high-redshift galaxies showing lower metallicities. This result
can be combined with our recent discover of metallicity gradients in three high
redshift galaxies showing disk dynamics. In these galaxies, the regions with
higher SFR also show lower metallicities. Both these evidences can be explained
by the effect of smooth infall of gas into previously enriched galaxies, with
the star-formation activity triggered by the infalling gas.

the size of the conducting particles and $\xi$ is the tunneling length) and the
specific composite microstructure. For large values of $D/\xi$, percolation
arises when the composite microstructure can be modeled as a regular lattice
that is fractionally occupied by conducting particle, while the tunneling
regime is always obtained for equilibrium distributions of conducting particles
in a continuum insulating matrix. As $D/\xi$ decreases the percolating behavior
of the conductivity of lattice-like composites gradually crosses over to the
tunneling-like regime characterizing particle dispersions in the continuum. For
$D/\xi$ values lower than $D/\xi\simeq 5$ the conductivity has tunneling-like

to the strong coupling $g_{B^* B\pi}$ or the normalized coupling $\hat g$.
Combining the precisely measured $q^2$ spectrum of $B\to \pi \ell \nu$ decay by
the BaBar and Belle collaborations with several parametrizations of the form

that the extracted values based on the BK, BZ and BCL parametrizations are

differentiate into two dynamical groups after a long time evolution. Within
each group, the oscillators have similar phases, while oscillators in different
groups have approximately opposite phases. The network gradually converts from
the initial random structure with a uniform distribution of connection
strengths into a modular structure which is characterized by strong intra
connections and weak inter connections. Furthermore, the connection strengths
follow a power law distribution, which is a natural consequence of the
coevolution of the network and the dynamics. Interestingly, it is found that if
the inter connections are weaker than a certain threshold, the two dynamical
groups will almost decouple and evolve independently. These results are helpful

matter and dark energy. It is characterized by a fluid with an equation of
state $p = - A/\rho^\alpha$. It can be obtained from a generalization of the
DBI action for a scalar, tachyonic field. At background level, this model gives
very good results, but it suffers from many drawbacks at perturbative level. We
show that, while for background analysis it is possible to consider any value
for $\alpha$, the perturbative analysis must be restricted to positive values
of $\alpha$. This restriction can be circumvented if the origin of the
generalized Chaplygin gas is traced back to a self-interacting scalar field,
instead of the DBI action. But, in doing so, the predictions coming from
formation of large scale structures reduce the generalized Chaplygin gas model
to a kind of quintessence model, and the unification scenario is lost, if the
scalar field is the canonical one. However, if the unification condition is
imposed from the beginning as a prior, the model may remain competitive. More
interesting results, concerning the unification program, are obtained if a
non-canonical self-interacting scalar field, inspired by Rastall's theory of
gravity, is imposed. In this case, an agreement with the background tests is
possible.

dynamical behavior of entangled states is of a great importance. In this paper
we suggest a useful scheme that permits a direct measure of entanglement in a
two-qubit cavity system. It is realized in the cavity-QED technology utilizing
atoms as fying qubits. To quantify entanglement we use the concurrence. We
derive the conditions, which assure that the state remains entangled in spite
of the interaction with the reservoir. The phenomenon of sudden death
entanglement (ESD) in a bipartite system subjected to squeezed vacuum reservoir
is examined. We show that the sudden death time of the entangled states depends
on the initial preparation of the entangled state and the parameters of the
squeezed vacuum reservoir.

cyclotron orbits blow up and the particle oscillates between the hole and

fixation in the presence of amorphic or hypermorphic mutations, we consider a
diallelic model at a single locus comprising a wild-type A and a mutant allele
A' produced irreversibly from A at small uniform rate v. The relative fitnesses
of the mutant homozygotes A'A', mutant heterozygotes A'A and wild-type
homozygotes AA are 1-s, 1-h and 1, respectively, where it is assumed that v<<
s. Here, we adopt an approach based on the direct treatment of the underlying
Markov chain (birth-death process) obeyed by the allele frequency (whose
dynamics is prescribed by the Moran model), which allows to accurately account
for the effects of large fluctuations. After a general description of the
theory, we focus on the case of a deleterious mutant allele (i.e. s>0) and
discuss three situations: when the mutant is (i) completely dominant (s=h);
(ii) completely recessive (h=0), and (iii) semi-dominant (h=s/2). Our
theoretical predictions for the mean fixation time and the quasi-stationary
distribution of the mutant population in the coexistence state, are shown to be
in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Furthermore, when s is

magnetoelectronics or thermoelectrics, there is a need for materials modeling
at the quantum-mechanical level. We combine density-functional with various
scale-bridging tools to establish correlations between the macroscopic
properties and the atomic structure of materials. For examples, magnetic memory
devices exploiting the tunneling magneto-resistance (TMR) effect depend
crucially on the spin polarization of the electrodes. Heusler alloys, e.g.
Co2MnSi, if perfectly ordered, are ferromagnetic half-metals with (ideally)
100% spin polarization. Their performance as electrodes in TMR devices is
limited by atomic disorder and deviations from perfect stoichiometry, but also
by interface states at the tunneling barrier. We use ab initio thermodynamics
in conjunction with the cluster expansion technique to show that excess
manganese in the alloy and at the interface helps to preserve the desired
half-metallic property. As another example, nanostructured materials with a
reduced thermal conductivity but good electrical conductivity are sought for
applications in thermoelectrics. Semiconductor heterostructures with a regular
arrangement of nanoscale inclusions ('quantum dot superlattices') hold the
promise of a high thermoelectric figure of merit. Our theoretical analysis
reveals that an increased figure of merit is to be expected if the quantum dot
size, the superlattice period and the doping level are all suitably fine-tuned.
Such a superlattice thus constitutes a material whose transport properties are
controlled by geometrical features at the nanoscale.

detected with a peak SNR ratio of 13 sigma in the radio source subtracted map.
Comparison of the SZ and X-ray images suggests that they both have extended
regions which lie approximately perpendicular to one another, with their
emission peaks significantly displaced. These features indicate
non-uniformities in the distributions of the gas temperature and pressure,
indicative of a cluster merger. We use a Bayesian cluster analysis to explore
the high-dimensional parameter space of the cluster-plus-sources model to
obtain cluster parameter estimates in the presence of radio point sources,
receiver noise and primordial CMB anisotropy; the probability of SZ + CMB
primordial structure + radio sources + receiver noise to CMB + radio sources +
receiver noise is 3 x 10^{6}:1. We compare the results from three different
cluster models. Our preferred model exploits the observation that the gas
fractions do not appear to vary greatly between clusters. Given the relative
masses of the two merging systems in Abell 2146, the mean gas temperature can
be deduced from the virial theorem (assuming all of the kinetic energy is in
the form of internal gas energy) without being affected significantly by the
merger event, provided the primary cluster was virialized before the merger. In
this model we fit a simple spherical isothermal beta-model, despite the
inadequacy of this model for a merging system like Abell 2146, and assume the
cluster follows the mass-temperature relation of a virialized, singular,
isothermal sphere. We note that this model avoids inferring large-scale cluster
parameters internal to r_200 under the widely used assumption of hydrostatic
equilibrium. We find that at r_200 M_T= 4.1 \pm 0.5 x 10^{14} h^{-1}M_sun and

  regarding the clarity of presentation",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Imitation learning in robots, also called programing by demonstration, has
made important advances in recent years, allowing humans to teach context
dependant motor skills/tasks to robots. We propose to extend the usual contexts
investigated to also include acoustic linguistic expressions that might denote
a given motor skill, and thus we target joint learning of the motor skills and
their potential acoustic linguistic name. In addition to this, a modification
of a class of existing algorithms within the imitation learning framework is
made so that they can handle the unlabeled demonstration of several tasks/motor
primitives without having to inform the imitator of what task is being
demonstrated or what the number of tasks are, which is a necessity for language
learning, i.e; if one wants to teach naturally an open number of new motor
skills together with their acoustic names. Finally, a mechanism for detecting
whether or not linguistic input is relevant to the task is also proposed, and
our architecture also allows the robot to find the right framing for a given
identified motor primitive. With these additions it becomes possible to build
an imitator that bridges the gap between imitation learning and language
learning by being able to learn linguistic expressions using methods from the
imitation learning community. In this sense the imitator can learn a word by
guessing whether a certain speech pattern present in the context means that a
specific task is to be executed. The imitator is however not assumed to know
that speech is relevant and has to figure this out on its own by looking at the
demonstrations: indeed, the architecture allows the robot to transparently also
learn tasks which should not be triggered by an acoustic word, but for example
by the color or position of an object or a gesture made by someone in the
environment. To demonstrate this ability to find the ...

the field and further deeper learning. However, it would be desirable to teach
the material in situ rather than providing a field trip at the end of a course;
thereby avoiding referring to the field trip in a few months time where
everything will become much clearer. Furthermore, there is clear evidence
provided by the National Peak Park Authority on how neglected e.g. the Peak
District National Park sites are by Primary and Secondary schools. They quote
inaccessibility and other common barriers associated to the outdoor classroom.
The archaeo-astronomy project envisages the development of an Elearning
environment allowing FE/HE students and pupils (Key Stage 2-4) to experience
and explore ancient landscapes e.g. in the Peak District National Park. This
project would support the learning experience of students on science and
environmental modules. Furthermore, it would allow schools to overcome the
initial problems of outdoor classroom. It is a research-based project located
at Nottingham Trent University that spans a large age range from secondary
school pupils up to undergraduate students. Additionally, it is a collaboration
between different departments and highly interdisciplinary including aspects of
Astronomy, Physics, Ecology, and Archaeology. A high priority is placed upon
the feedback between participants and teachers, especially bridging the gap
from HE to secondary schools and colleges. Thereby, students represent role

a local HI bubble at a distance of approx. 100 pc, and not by the magnetic

polynomial $F=\sum_{i=0}^n A_i x^i$ with real coefficients. It is assumed that
each coefficient of $F$ can be approximated to any specified error bound. The
presented method is exact, complete and deterministic. Due to its similarities
to the Descartes method, we also consider it practical and easy to implement.
Compared to previous approaches, our new method achieves a significantly better
bit complexity. It is further shown that the hardness of isolating the real
roots of $F$ is exclusively determined by the geometry of the roots and not by
the complexity or the size of the coefficients. For the special case where $F$
has integer coefficients of maximal bitsize $\tau$, our bound on the bit
complexity writes as $\tilde{O}(n^3\tau^2)$ which improves the best bounds
known for existing practical algorithms by a factor of $n=deg F$. The crucial
idea underlying the new approach is to run an approximate version of the
Descartes method, where, in each subdivision step, we only consider
approximations of the intermediate results to a certain precision. We give an
upper bound on the maximal precision that is needed for isolating the roots of
$F$. For integer polynomials, this bound is by a factor $n$ lower than that of
the precision needed when using exact arithmetic explaining the improved bound
on the bit complexity.

Ri, 2) The Group sunspot number series Rh (1610-1995 AD), 3) The simulated

particularly). Data series are smoothed over 11 years and supercenturial trends
are removed. Two principally independent methods of time series analysis are
used: the T-R periodogram analysis (both in the standard and ""scanning window""
regimes) and the wavelet-analysis. The obtained results are very similar. It is
found that in all series a strong cycle with mean duration of 55-60 years
exists. It is very well expressed in the 18th and the 19th centuries. It is
less pronounced during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th
centuries. On the other hand a strong and stable quasi 110-120 years and
~200-year cycles are obtained in all of these series except in Ri. In the last
series a strong mean oscillation of ~ 95 years is found, which is absent in the
other data sets. The analysis of the ESAI (1090-2002 AD) proved that the quasi
century cycle has a relatively stable doublet (~80 and ~120 years) or triplet
(~55-60, 80 and 120 years) structure during the last ~900 years. An interesting
feature in all series is the existence of significant ~29-year cycle after the
last centurial Gleissberg-Gnevishev's minimum (1898-1923 AD). Most probably the
different types of oscillations in the sub-century and century period range

minimal supergravity boundary conditions. Both left-right and (B-L) symmetries
are broken at an energy scale close to, but significantly below the GUT scale.
Neutrino data is explained via a seesaw mechanism. We calculate the RGEs for
superpotential and soft parameters complete at 2-loop order. At low energies
lepton flavour violation (LFV) and small, but potentially measurable mass
splittings in the charged scalar lepton sector appear, due to the RGE running.
Different from the supersymmetric 'pure seesaw' models, both, LFV and slepton
mass splittings, occur not only in the left- but also in the right slepton
sector. Especially, ratios of LFV slepton decays, such as Br(${\tilde\tau}_R
\to \mu \chi^0_1$)/Br(${\tilde\tau}_L \to \mu \chi^0_1$) are sensitive to the
ratio of (B-L) and left-right symmetry breaking scales. Also the model predicts
a polarization asymmetry of the outgoing positrons in the decay $\mu^+ \to e^+
\gamma$, A ~ [0,1], which differs from the pure seesaw 'prediction' A=1$.

off-resonant, degenerate Doppler-free TPA on the 5S1/2 - 5D5/2 transition and

that transit time effects play an important role in determining the two-photon

the group of invertibles of a field. It is constructed by comparing

notion of joint torsion generalizes the Carey-Pincus joint torsion of a pair of

invertibility assumptions, we show that the joint torsion recovers the
multiplicative Lefschetz numbers. Furthermore, in the case of Toeplitz
operators over the polydisc we provide a link between the joint torsion and the
Cauchy integral formula. We will also consider the algebraic properties of the
joint torsion. They include a cocycle property, a symmetry property, a
triviality property and a multiplicativity property. The proof of these results
relies on a quite general comparison theorem for vertical and horizontal

properties with the so-called Hot Jupiters. Most of these young stars have
highly eccentric orbits, and were probably not formed in-situ. It has been
proposed that these stars acquired their current orbits from the tidal
disruption of compact massive binaries scattered toward the proximity of the
central supermassive black hole. Assuming a binary star formed in a thin
gaseous disk beyond 0.1 pc from the central object, we investigate the
relevance of disk-satellite interactions to harden the binding energy of the
binary, and to drive its inward migration. A massive, equal-mass binary star is
found to become more tightly wound as it migrates inwards toward the central
black hole. The migration timescale is very similar to that of a single-star
satellite of the same mass. The binary's hardening is caused by the formation
of spiral tails lagging the stars inside the binary's Hill radius. We show that
the hardening timescale is mostly determined by the mass of gas inside the
binary's Hill radius, and that it is much shorter than the migration timescale.
We discuss some implications of the binary's hardening process. When the more
massive (primary) components of close binaries eject most their mass through
supernova explosion, their secondary stars may attain a range of eccentricities
and inclinations. Such processes may provide an alternative unified scenario
for the origin of the kinematic properties of the central cluster and S-stars
in the Galactic center as well as the high velocity stars in the Galactic halo.
