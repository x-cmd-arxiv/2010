fast-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, the
energy-efficiency is defined as the transmission rate to power ratio and shown
to be maximized at low transmit power. The most interesting case is the one of
slow fading MIMO channels. For this type of channels, the optimal precoding
scheme is generally not trivial. Furthermore, using all the available transmit
power is not always optimal in the sense of energy-efficiency (which, in this
case, corresponds to the communication-theoretic definition of the
goodput-to-power (GPR) ratio). Finding the optimal precoding matrices is shown
to be a new open problem and is solved in several special cases: 1. when there

model used to account for the effects of transmit and receive antenna
correlations is the unitary-invariant-unitary model, which is one of the most
general models available in the literature. In this context, we introduce and
analyze two resource allocation games. In both games, the mobile stations
selfishly choose their power allocation policies in order to maximize their
individual uplink transmission rates; in particular they can ignore some
specified centralized policies. In the first game considered, the base station
implements successive interference cancellation (SIC) and each mobile station
chooses his best space-time power allocation scheme; here, a coordination
mechanism is used to indicate to the users the order in which the receiver
applies SIC. In the second framework, the base station is assumed to implement
single-user decoding. For these two games a thorough analysis of the Nash
equilibrium is provided: the existence and uniqueness issues are addressed; the
corresponding power allocation policies are determined by exploiting random
matrix theory; the sum-rate efficiency of the equilibrium is studied
analytically in the low and high signal-to-noise ratio regimes and by
simulations in more typical scenarios. Simulations show that, in particular,
the sum-rate efficiency is high for the type of systems investigated and the
performance loss due to the use of the proposed suboptimum coordination
mechanism is very small.

quality factor and RMS amplitude drops sharply above above a critical
frequency. For XTE J1701-462 this frequency is estimated to be ~800 Hz, where
the quality factor reaches a maximum of ~200 (e.g. a value consistent with the
one observed from more classical systems, such as 4U~1636-536). Such a drop has
been interpreted as the signature of the innermost stable circular orbit, and
that interpretation is consistent with the observations we report here. The kHz
QPOs in the Z state are much less coherent and lower amplitude than they are in
the atoll state. We argue that the change of the QPO properties between the two
source states is related to the change of the scale height of the accretion

by-product of our analysis, we also increased the significance of the upper kHz

application to low-intensity computed tomography (CT) projection data, which is
based on constrained, total-variation (TV) minimization. The algorithm design
focuses on recovering structure on length scales comparable to a detector-bin
width.
  Method: Recovering the resolution on the scale of a detector bin, requires
that pixel size be much smaller than the bin width. The resulting image array
contains many more pixels than data, and this undersampling is overcome with a
combination of Fourier upsampling of each projection and the use of
constrained, TV-minimization, as suggested by compressive sensing. The
presented pseudo-code for solving constrained, TV-minimization is designed to
yield an accurate solution to this optimization problem within 100 iterations.
  Results: The proposed image-reconstruction algorithm is applied to a
low-intensity scan of a rabbit with a thin wire, to test resolution. The
proposed algorithm is compared with filtered back-projection (FBP).
  Conclusion: The algorithm may have some advantage over FBP in that the
resulting noise-level is lowered at equivalent contrast levels of the wire.

model potential that is piecewise Eckart (piecewise Poeschl-Teller), and
developing an analytic ``quantization condition'' for the highly-damped

common but not universal, with the controlling feature being whether or not the
ratio of the surface gravities is a rational number. We furthermore observed
that the relation between rational ratios of surface gravities and periodicity
of QNFs is very generic, and also occurs within different analytic approaches
applied to various types of black hole spacetimes. These observations are of
direct relevance to any physical situation where highly-damped quasi-normal
modes are important.

some 500 ms$^{-1}$ greater than those in giants. Such a signature is searched
for between groups of open-cluster stars which share the same average space
motion and thus have the same average Doppler shift. 144 main-sequence stars
and cool giants were observed in the M67 open cluster using the ESO FEROS
spectrograph, obtaining radial velocities by cross correlation with a spectral
template. M67 dwarf and giant radial-velocity distributions are well
represented by Gaussian functions, sharing the same apparent average radial
velocity within $\simeq$ 100 ms$^{-1}$. In addition, dwarfs in M67 appear to be
dynamically hotter ($\sigma$ = 0.90 kms$^{-1}$) than giants ($\sigma$ = 0.68
kms$^{-1}$). Explanations for the lack of an expected signal are sought: a
likely cause is the differential wavelength shifts produced by different
hydrodynamics in dwarf and giant atmospheres. Radial-velocity differences
measured between unblended lines in low-noise averaged spectra vary with
line-strength: stronger lines are more blushifted in dwarfs than in giants,
apparently 'compensating' for the gravitational redshift. Synthetic
high-resolution spectra are computed from 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model
atmospheres for both giants and dwarfs, and synthetic wavelength shifts
obtained. In agreement with observations, 3D models predict substantially
smaller wavelength-shift differences than expected from gravitational redshift
only. The procedures developed could be used to test 3D models for different
classes of stars, but will ultimately require high-fidelity spectra for
measurements of wavelength shifts in individual spectral lines.

the MRI-driven turbulence, we construct a steady model for a geometrically thin
disk using ""non-standard"" $\alpha$-prescription. The efficiency of the angular
momentum transport depends on the magnetic Prandtl number, $Pm = \nu/\eta$,
where $\nu$ and $\eta$ are the microscopic viscous and magnetic diffusivities.
In our disk model, Shakura-Sunyaev's $\alpha$-parameter has a power-law
dependence on the magnetic Prandtl number, that is $\alpha \propto Pm^\delta$
where $\delta$ is the constant power-law index. Adopting Spitzer's microscopic
diffusivities, the magnetic Prandtl number becomes a decreasing function of the
disk radius when $\delta > 0$. The transport efficiency of the angular momentum
and the viscous heating rate are thus smaller in the outer part of the disk,
while these are impacted by the size of index $\delta$. We find that the disk
becomes more unstable to the gravitational instability for a larger value of
index $\delta$. The most remarkable feature of our disk model is that the
thermal and secular instabilities can grow in its middle part even if the
radiation pressure is negligibly small in the condition $\delta > 2/3$. In the
realistic disk systems, it would be difficult to maintain the steady mass
accretion state unless the $Pm$-dependence of MRI-driven turbulence is
relatively weak.

a distributed MAC protocol that allows collision-free access to the medium in
WLAN. The only difference between CSMA/ECA and the well-known CSMA/CA is that
the former uses a deterministic backoff after successful transmissions.
Collision-free operation is reached after a transient state during which some
collisions may occur. This article shows that the duration of the transient
state can be shortened by appropriately setting the contention parameters.
Standard absorbing Markov Chain theory can be used to describe the behaviour of
the system in the transient state and to predict the expected number of slots
to reach the collision-free operation.
  The article also introduces CSMA/E2CA, in which a deterministic backoff is
used two consecutive times after a successful transmission. CSMA/E2CA converges
quicker to collision-free operation and delivers higher performance than
CSMA/CA in harsh wireless scenarios with high frame error rates.
  To achieve collision-free operations when the number of contenders is large,
it may be necessary to dynamically adjust the contention parameter. The last

nonminimally coupled to gravity. In the Jordan frame, the potential contains
$\phi^4$ term as well as terms in the original hybrid inflation model. In our
model, inflation can be classified into the type (I) and the type (II). In the
type (I), inflation is terminated by the tachyonic instability of the waterfall
field, while in the type (II) by the violation of slow-roll conditions. In our
model, the reheating takes place only at the true minimum and even in the case
(II) finally the tachyonic instability occurs after the termination of
inflation. For a negative nonminimal coupling, inflation takes place in the
vacuum-dominated region, in the large field region, or near the local
minimum/maximum. Inflation in the vacuum dominated region becomes either the
type (I) or (II), resulting in blue or red spectrum of the curvature
perturbations, respectively. Inflation around the local maximum can be either
the type (I) or the type (II), which results in the red spectrum of the
curvature perturbations, while it around the local minimum must be the type
(I), which results in the blue spectrum. In the large field region, to
terminate inflation, potential in the Einstein frame must be positively tilted,
always resulting in the red spectrum. We then numerically solve the equations
of motion to investigate the whole dynamics of inflaton and confirm that the
spectrum of curvature perturbations changes from red to blue ones as scales
become smaller.
