applicable for the twisted mass action in the chiral limit) and a family of
Symanzik improved actions for gluons. Our calculations have been carried out in
a general covariant gauge. Results have been obtained for several popular
choices of values for the Symanzik coefficients. While our Green's function
calculations regard any pointlike 4-fermion operators which do not mix with
lower dimension ones, we pay particular attention to DF=2 operators, both
Parity Conserving and Parity Violating (F: flavour). We compute the
perturbative renormalization constants for a complete basis of 4-fermion
operators and we study their mixing pattern. For some of the actions considered
here, even O(a^0) results did not exist in the literature to date. The
correction terms which we calculate are essential ingredients for minimizing
the lattice artifacts which are present in non-perturbative evaluations of
renormalization constants with the RI'-MOM method. Our perturbative results,
for the matrix elements of DF=2 operators and for the corresponding
renormalization matrices, depend on a large number of parameters: coupling
constant, number of colors, lattice spacing, external momentum, clover
parameter, Symanzik coefficients, gauge parameter. To make these results most
easily accessible, we have included them in the distribution package of this

0.6, and the redshift range of their arcs is from 0.4 to 4.9. These clusters
are selected carefully from strong gravitational lensing systems which have
both X-ray satellite observations and optical giant luminous arcs with known
redshift. Giant arcs usually appear in the central region of clusters, where
mass can be traced with luminosity quite well. Based on gravitational lensing
theory and cluster mass distribution model we can derive an Hubble constant
independent ratio between two angular diameter distances. One is the distance
of lensing source and the other is that between the deflector and the source.
Since angular diameter distance relies heavily on cosmological geometry, we can
use these ratios to constrain cosmological models. Meanwhile X-ray gas
fractions of galaxy clusters can also be a cosmological probe. Because there
are a dozen parameters to be fitted, we introduce a new analytic algorithm,
Powell's UOBYQA (Unconstrained Optimization By Quadratic Approximation), to
accelerate our calculation. Our result proves that this algorithm is an
effective fitting method for such continuous multi-parameter constraint. We
find an interesting fact that these two approaches are sensitive to
$\Omega_{\Lambda}$ and $\Omega_{M}$ separately. Combining them we can get quite
good fitting values of basic cosmological parameters:
$\Omega_{M}=0.26_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$, and $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.82_{-0.16}^{+0.14}$ .

how we adapted the lattice-Boltzmann method to simulate vesicle dynamics, using
an approach known from the immersed boundary method. The fluid flow is computed
on an Eulerian regular fixed mesh while the location of the vesicle membrane is
tracked by a Lagrangian moving mesh. As benchmarking tests, the known vesicle
equilibrium shapes in a fluid at rest are found and the dynamical behavior of a
vesicle under simple shear flow is being reproduced. Further, we focus on
investigating the effect of the confinement on the dynamics, a question that
has received little attention so far. In particular, we study how the vesicle
steady inclination angle in the tank-treading regime depends on the degree of
confinement. The influence of the confinement on the effective viscosity of the
composite fluid is also analyzed. At a given reduced volume (the swelling
degree) of a vesicle we find that both the inclination angle, and the membrane
tank-treading velocity decrease with increasing confinement. At sufficiently
large degree of confinement the tank-treading velocity exhibits a
non-monotonous dependence on the reduced volume and the effective viscosity

images of the V445 Pup progenitor using astronomical plate archives. The
brightness of the progenitor in the B band was 14.3 mag. It was a periodic
variable star, its most probable period being 0.650654+/-0.000011 day. The
light curve shape suggests that the progenitor was a common-envelope binary
with a spot on the surface and variable surface brightness. The spectral energy
distribution of the progenitor between 0.44 and 2.2 micrometers was similar to
that of an A0V type star. After the explosion in 2001, the dust was formed in
the ejecta, and the star became a strong infrared source. This resulted in the
star's fading below 20 mag in the V band. Our CCD BVR observations acquired
between 2003 and 2009 suggest that the dust absorption minimum finished in
2004, and the remnant reappeared at the level of 18.5 mag V. The dust dispersed
but a star-like object was absent in frames taken in the K band with the VLT
adaptive optics. Only expanding ejecta of the explosion were seen in these
frames till March 2007. No reddened A0V type star reappeared in the spectral
energy distribution. The explosion of V445 Pup in 2000 was a helium flash on
the surface of a CO-type white dwarf. Taking into account the results of modern
dynamic calculations, we discuss the possibility of a white-dwarf core
detonation triggered by the helium flash and the observational evidence for it.
Additionally, the common envelope of the system was lost in the explosion.
Destruction in the system and mass loss from its components exclude the future

addressed some open questions of the CSHKP scenario of solar flares by means of
high-resolution MHD simulations. They focused, in particular, on the problem of
energy transfer from large to small scales in decaying flare current sheet
(CS). Their calculations suggest, that magnetic flux-ropes (plasmoids) are
formed in full range of scales by a cascade of tearing and coalescence
processes. Consequently, the initially thick current layer becomes highly
fragmented. Thus, the tearing and coalescence cascade can cause an effective
energy transfer across the scales. In the current paper we investigate whether
this mechanism actually applies in solar flares. We extend the MHD simulation
by deriving model-specific features that can be looked for in observations. The
results of the underlying MHD model showed that the plasmoid cascade creates a
specific hierarchical distribution of non-ideal/acceleration regions embedded
in the CS. We therefore focus on the features associated with the fluxes of
energetic particles, in particular on the structure and dynamics of emission
regions in flare ribbons. We assume that the structure and dynamics of
diffusion regions embedded in the CS imprint themselves into structure and
dynamics of flare-ribbon kernels by means of magnetic-field mapping. Using the
results of the underlying MHD simulation we derive the expected structure of
ribbon emission and we extract selected statistical properties of the modelled
bright kernels. Comparing the predicted emission and its properties with the
observed ones we obtain a good agreement of the two.

order to predict the near-bed upward convex profile, an additional parameter
{\alpha} is needed. This parameter could be related to settling velocity

well with the basic neuronal paradigm of the cognitive science. QL information
processing is based (surprisingly) on classical electromagnetic signals induced

based on representation of quantum mechanics as a version of classical signal
theory which was recently elaborated by the author. The brain uses the QL
representation (QLR) for working with abstract concepts; concrete images are
described by classical information theory. Two processes, classical and QL, are
performed parallely. Moreover, information is actively transmitted from one
representation to another. A QL concept given in our model by a density
operator can generate a variety of concrete images given by temporal
realizations of the corresponding (Gaussian) random signal. This signal has the
covariance operator coinciding with the density operator encoding the abstract

the Fisher discriminant rule leads to poor results due to diverging spectra and
noise accumulation. Therefore, researchers proposed independence rules to
circumvent the diverse spectra, and sparse independence rules to mitigate the
issue of noise accumulation. However, in biological applications, there are
often a group of correlated genes responsible for clinical outcomes, and the
use of the covariance information can significantly reduce misclassification
rates. The extent of such error rate reductions is unveiled by comparing the
misclassification rates of the Fisher discriminant rule and the independence
rule. To materialize the gain based on finite samples, a Regularized Optimal
Affine Discriminant (ROAD) is proposed based on a covariance penalty. ROAD
selects an increasing number of features as the penalization relaxes. Further
benefits can be achieved when a screening method is employed to narrow the
feature pool before hitting the ROAD. An efficient Constrained Coordinate

problems. Sampling properties of oracle type are established. Simulation
studies and real data analysis support our theoretical results and demonstrate
the advantages of the new classification procedure under a variety of

with high redshift samples (LBGs, BzK, and sub-mm galaxies at z=2-3) having IR

and LBAs is very similar. Because LBAs are much better analogs to LBGs compared
to previous local star-forming samples, including M99, the practice of
dust-correcting the SFRs of high redshift galaxies based on the local

properties of polycrystalline Nb0.18Re0.82, which has a superconducting
transition at Tc ~ 8.8 K. The non-centrosymmetric alpha-Mn structure of the
compound is confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Using the measured values for the
lower critical field Hc1, upper critical field Hc2, and the specific heat C, we
estimate the thermodynamic critical field Hc(0), coherence length {\xi}(0),
penetration depth {\lambda}(0), and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter {\kappa}(0).
The specific heat jump at Tc, {\Delta}C/{\gamma}Tc = 1.86, suggests that
Nb0.18Re0.82 is moderately coupled superconductor. Below Tc the electronic
specific heat decays exponentially, suggesting that the gap is isotropic. Our
data suggests that the triplet admixture is weak in the polycrystalline form of
compound. However, the estimated value of the upper critical field Hc2(0) is
close to the calculated Pauli limit indicating the need for single crystal
measurements.

k-transitive-closure-spanner (k-TCspanner) of G is a directed graph H that has
(1) the same transitive-closure as G and (2) diameter at most k. In some
applications, the shortcut paths added to the graph in order to obtain small
diameter can use Steiner vertices, that is, vertices not in the original graph
G. The resulting spanner is called a Steiner transitive-closure spanner
(Steiner TC-spanner).
  Motivated by applications to property reconstruction and access control
hierarchies, we concentrate on Steiner TC-spanners of directed acyclic graphs
or, equivalently, partially ordered sets. In these applications, the goal is to
find a sparsest Steiner k-TC-spanner of a poset G for a given k and G. The
focus of this paper is the relationship between the dimension of a poset and
the size of its sparsest Steiner TCspanner. The dimension of a poset G is the
smallest d such that G can be embedded into a d-dimensional directed hypergrid
via an order-preserving embedding.
  We present a nearly tight lower bound on the size of Steiner 2-TC-spanners of
d-dimensional directed hypergrids. It implies better lower bounds on the
complexity of local reconstructors of monotone functions and functions with low
Lipschitz constant. The proof of the lower bound constructs a dual solution to
a linear programming relaxation of the Steiner 2-TC-spanner problem. We also
show that one can efficiently construct a Steiner 2-TC-spanner, of size
matching the lower bound, for any low-dimensional poset. Finally, we present a
lower bound on the size of Steiner k-TC-spanners of d-dimensional posets that
shows that the best-known construction, due to De Santis et al., cannot be
improved significantly.

explored. To this end, the displacements of fluorescent tracer beads embedded
in polyacrylamide gels are quantified by confocal microscopy under shear
deformation, and the deviations of these displacements from affine responses
are recorded. Non-affinity within the gels is quantified as a function of
polymer chain density and cross-link concentration. Observations are in
qualitative agreement with current theories of polymer network non-affinity.
The measured degree of non-affinity in the polyacrylamide gels suggests the
presence of structural inhomogeneities which likely result from heterogeneous
reaction kinetics during gel preparation. In addition, the macroscopic
elasticity of the polyacrylamide gels is confirmed to behave in accordance with
standard models of flexible polymer network elasticity.

are thought to cause long-term changes in the solar spectral irradiance, which
are important for determining the impact on Earth's climate. To study the
effect of small-scale magnetic elements on total and spectral irradiance, we
derive their contrasts from 3-D MHD simulations of the solar atmosphere. Such
calculations are necessary since measurements of small-scale flux tube
contrasts are confined to a few wavelengths and suffer from scattered light and
instrument defocus, even for space observations. To test the contrast
calculations, we compare rms contrasts from simulations with those obtained
with the broad-band filter imager mounted on the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT)
onboard the Hinode satellite and also analyse centre-to-limb variations (CLV).
The 3-D MHD simulations include the interaction between convection and magnetic
flux tubes. They have been run with non-grey radiative transfer using the MURaM
code. Simulations have an average vertical magnetic field of 0G, 50G, and 200G.
Emergent intensities are calculated with the spectral synthesis code ATLAS9 and
are convolved with a theoretical point-spread function to account for the
properties of the observations' optical system. We find reasonable agreement
for simulated and observed intensity distributions in the visible continuum
bands. Agreement is poorer for the CN and G-Bands. The analysis of the
simulations exhibits a potentially more realistic centre-to-limb behaviour than
calculations based on 1-D model atmospheres. We conclude that starting from 3-D
MHD simulations represents a powerful approach to obtaining intensity contrasts
for a wide wavelength coverage and for different positions on the solar disk.
This also paves the way for future calculations of facular and network contrast
as a function of magnetic fluxes.

large-scale space-time metric from observations with a minimum of assumptions
-- without, for instance, assuming that the universe is almost
Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW). If we are lucky enough this
would be a way of demonstrating that our universe is FLRW, instead of
presupposing it or simply showing that the observations are consistent with
FLRW. Showing how to do this within the more general spherically symmetric,
inhomogeneous space-time framework takes us a long way towards fulfilling this
goal. In recent work researchers have shown how this can be done both in the
traditional Lema\^{i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) 3 + 1 coordinate framework, and in
the observational coordinate (OC) framework. In this paper we investigate the
stability of solutions, and the use of data in the OC field equations including
their time evolution and compare both approaches with respect to the
singularity problem at the maximum of the angular-diameter distance, the
stability of solutions, and the use of data in the field equations. This allows
a more detailed account and assessment of the OC integration procedure, and
enables a comparison of the relative advantages of the two equivalent solution
frameworks. Both formulations and integration procedures should, in principle,
lead to the same results. However, as we show in this paper, the OC procedure
manifests certain advantages, particularly in the avoidance of coordinate
singularities at the maximum of the angular-diameter distance, and in the
stability of the solutions obtained. This particular feature is what allows us
to do the best fitting of the data to smooth data functions and the possibility
of constructing analytic solutions to the field equations.

A_0 = B_0 + m_0, and the gravitino mass is fixed by m_{3/2} = m_0. We also

a preference for values of m_{1/2} and m_0 similar to those found previously in
frequentist analyses of the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) and a model with common

VCMSSM, and one with large m_0 but small m_{1/2}. We compare the probabilities

many-particle distributions that exhibit unusual clustering and asymptotic
local number density fluctuations growing more slowly than the volume of an
observation window but faster than the surface area. By targeting a specified
form of the structure factor at small wavenumbers using collective density
variables, we are able to tailor the form of asymptotic local density
fluctuations while simultaneously measuring the effect of imposing weak and
strong constraints on the available degrees of freedom within the system. Even
in one dimension, the long-range effective interactions induce clustering and
nontrivial phase transitions in the resulting ground-state configurations. We
provide an analytical connection between the fraction of contrained degrees of
freedom within the system and the disorder-order phase transition for a class
of target structure factors by examining the realizability of the constrained
contribution to the pair correlation function. Our results explicitly
demonstrate that disordered hyperuniform many-particle ground states, and
therefore also point distributions, with substantial clustering can be
constructed. We directly relate the local coordination structure of our point
patterns to the distribution of the void space external to the particles, and
we provide a scaling argument for the configurational entropy of the systems
when only a small fraction of the degrees of freedom are constrained. By
emphasizing the intimate connection between geometrical constraints on the
particle distribution and structural regularity, our work has direct
implications for higher-dimensional systems, including an understanding of the
appearance of hyperuniformity and quasi-long-range pair correlations in
maximally random strictly jammed packings of hard spheres.

of the broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) 2009bb are presented, following the
flux evolution from -10 to +285 days past B-band maximum. Thanks to the very
early discovery, it is possible to place tight constraints on the SN explosion
epoch. The expansion velocities measured from near maximum spectra are found to
be only slightly smaller than those measured from spectra of the prototype
broad-lined SN 1998bw associated with GRB 980425. Fitting an analytical model
to the pseudo-bolometric light curve of SN 2009bb suggests that 4.1+-1.9 Msun
of material was ejected with 0.22 +-0.06 Msun of it being 56Ni. The resulting
kinetic energy is 1.8+-0.7x10^52 erg. This, together with an absolute peak
magnitude of MB=-18.36+-0.44, places SN 2009bb on the energetic and luminous
end of the broad-lined Type Ic (SN Ic) sequence. Detection of helium in the
early time optical spectra accompanied with strong radio emission, and high
metallicity of its environment makes SN 2009bb a peculiar object. Similar to
the case for GRBs, we find that the bulk explosion parameters of SN 2009bb
cannot account for the copious energy coupled to relativistic ejecta, and
conclude that another energy reservoir (a central engine) is required to power
the radio emission. Nevertheless, the analysis of the SN 2009bb nebular
spectrum suggests that the failed GRB detection is not imputable to a large
angle between the line-of-sight and the GRB beamed radiation. Therefore, if a
GRB was produced during the SN 2009bb explosion, it was below the threshold of
the current generation of gamma-ray instruments.

harder than solving the original problem. Even worse, truthfulness can be
utterly destroyed by small uncertainties in a mechanism's outcome. One obstacle
is that truthful payments depend on outcomes other than the one realized, such
as the lengths of non-shortest-paths in a shortest-path auction. Single-call
mechanisms are a powerful tool that circumvents this obstacle --- they
implicitly charge truthful payments, guaranteeing truthfulness in expectation
using only the outcome realized by the mechanism. The cost of such truthfulness
is a trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and the risk of
large payments.
  We largely settle when and to what extent single-call mechanisms are
possible. The first single-call construction was discovered by Babaioff,
Kleinberg, and Slivkins [BKS10] in single-parameter domains. They give a
transformation that turns any monotone, single-parameter allocation rule into a
truthful-in-expectation single-call mechanism. Our first result is a natural
complement to [BKS10]: we give a new transformation that produces a single-call
VCG mechanism from any allocation rule for which VCG payments are truthful.
Second, in both the single-parameter and VCG settings, we precisely
characterize the possible transformations, showing that that a wide variety of
transformations are possible but that all take a very simple form. Finally, we
study the inherent trade-off between the expected quality of the outcome and
the risk of large payments. We show that our construction and that of [BKS10]
simultaneously optimize a variety of metrics in their respective domains.
  As an example, we analyze pay-per-click advertising auctions, where the
truthfulness of the standard VCG-based auction is easily broken when the

up. During the planet formation stage, embryos undergoing type I migration are
expected to be stalled at inner edge of magnetic inactive disk ($a_{\rm crit}
\sim 0.2-0.3 ~$AU). This mechanism makes the location around $a_{\rm crit}$ a
sweet spot of forming planets. Especially, $a_{\rm crit}$ of dwarf stars with
masses $\sim 0.5 M_\odot$ is roughly inside the habitable zone of the system.
In this paper we study the formation of habitable planets due to this mechanism
with a model system OGLE-06-109L. It has a $0.51 M_\odot$ dwarf star with two
giant planets in 2.3 and 4.6 AU observed by microlensing. We model the embryos
undergoing type I migration in the gas disk with a constant disk accretion rate
($\dot M$). Giant planets in outside orbits affect the formation of habitable
planets through secular perturbations at the early stage and secular resonance
at the later stage. We find that the existence and the masses of the habitable
planets in OGLE-06-10L system depend on both $\dot M$ and the speed of type I
migration. If planets formed earlier so that $\dot M$ is larger ($\sim 10^{-7}
M_\odot $ yr$^{-1}$), terrestrial planet can not be survived unless the type I
migration rate is an order of magnitude less. If planets formed later so that
$\dot M$ is smaller ($\sim 10^{-8} M_\odot $ yr$^{-1}$), single and high mass
terrestrial planets with high water contents ($\sim 5% $) will be formed by
inward migration of outer planet cores. A slower speed migration will result in
several planets by collisions of embryos, thus their water contents are low
($\sim 2%$). Mean motion resonances or apsidal resonances among planets may be
observed if multiple planets survived in the inner system.

Schrodinger's equation does this for isolated quantum systems. Describing the
time evolution of a quantum system that interacts with its environment, in its
most general form, has proved to be difficult because the dynamics is dependent
on the state of the environment and the correlations with it. For discrete
processes, such as quantum gates or chemical reactions, quantum process
tomography provides the complete description of the dynamics, provided that the
initial states of the system and the environment are independent of each other.
However, many physical systems are correlated with the environment at the
beginning of the experiment. Here, we give a prescription of quantum process
tomography that yields the complete description of the dynamics of the system
even when the initial correlations are present. Surprisingly, our method also
gives quantitative expressions for the initial correlation.

curve for Cerro Paranal under typical clear-sky observing conditions, with an
accuracy of 0.01 mag/airmass. Methods: The extinction curve of Paranal was
obtained through low-resolution spectroscopy of 8 spectrophotometric standard
stars observed with FORS1 mounted at the 8.2 m Very Large Telescope, covering a
spectral range 3300-8000 A. A total of 600 spectra were collected on more than
40 nights distributed over six months, from October 2008 to March 2009. The
average extinction curve was derived using a global fit algorithm, which
allowed us to simultaneously combine all the available data. The main
atmospheric parameters were retrieved using the LBLRTM radiative transfer code,
which was also utilised to study the impact of variability of the main
molecular bands of O2, O3, and H2O, and to estimate their column densities.
Results: In general, the extinction curve of Paranal appears to conform to
those derived for other astronomical sites in the Atacama desert, like La Silla
and Cerro Tololo. However, a systematic deficit with respect to the extinction
curve derived for Cerro Tololo before the El Chichon eruption is detected below
4000 A. We attribute this downturn to a non standard aerosol composition,
probably revealing the presence of volcanic pollutants above the Atacama
desert. An analysis of all spectroscopic extinction curves obtained since 1974
shows that the aerosol composition has been evolving during the last 35 years.
The persistence of traces of non meteorologic haze suggests the effect of
volcanic eruptions, like those of El Chichon and Pinatubo, lasts several
decades. The usage of the standard CTIO and La Silla extinction curves
implemented in IRAF and MIDAS produce systematic over/under-estimates of the
absolute flux.

of the decay probabilities to KS K+pi- and K+K-pi+pi-pi0 are determined. The
latter mode is studied for the first time. The reactions e+e- --> e+e- gamma*

to departures from form dominance, corresponding to deviations from the real

successful leptogenesis. The analytic results show that the corrections to
tri-bimaximal mixing and form dominance depend on the pattern of the vacuum
misalignment, with the two effects being uncorrelated.

Lorentzian analogues of complex and CR structures. In this context, we extend
the Goldberg-Sachs theorem to five dimensions. To be precise, we find a new

condition, in the sense that it ensures the existence of such congruences on a
five-dimensional spacetime, vacuum or under weaker assumptions on the Ricci
tensor. This results in a significant simplification of the field equations. We
discuss possible degenerate cases, including a five-dimensional generalisation
of the Petrov type D condition. We also show that the vacuum black ring
solution is endowed with optical structures, yet fails to be algebraically
special with respect to them. We finally explain the generalisation of these
ideas to higher dimensions, which has been checked in six and seven dimensions.

One important ingredient in the predicted BBN abundance of 6Li is the
low-energy 2H(alpha,gamma)6Li cross section. Up to now, the only available
experimental result for this cross section showed an almost constant
astrophysical S-factor below 400 keV, contrary to theoretical expectations. We
report on a new measurement of the 2H(alpha,gamma)6Li reaction using the
break-up of 6Li at 150 A MeV. Even though we cannot separate experimentally the
Coulomb contribution from the nuclear one, we find clear evidence for
Coulomb-nuclear interference by analyzing the scattering-angular distributions.
This is in-line with our theoretical description which indicates a drop of the
S_24-factor at low energies as predicted also by most other models.
Consequently, we find even lower upper limits for the calculated primordial 6Li
abundance than before.

information for differentiating false link failure from true link failure. The
MAC layer adaptively selects a retransmission limit (short and long) based on
the neighbour signal strength and sender node speed information from the
physical layer. The proposed approach tracks the signal strength of each node
in network and, while transmitting to a neighbour node, if it's received signal
strength is high and is received recently then Adaptive MAC persists in its
retransmission attempts. As there is high probability that neighbour node is

$\Ot(M^{\w/(\w+1)}n^{(\w^2+3)/(\w+1)})$ time, where $\w < 2.376$ is the
exponent of fast matrix multiplication, $n$ is the number of vertices of the
graph, and the edge weights are integers in $\{-M,...,0,...,M\}$. For bounded
integer weights the running time is $O(n^{2.561})$ and if $\w=2+o(1)$ it is
$\Ot(n^{7/3})$. This is the first algorithm that computes the diameter of an
integer weighted directed graph polynomially faster than any known All-Pairs
Shortest Paths (APSP) algorithm. For bounded integer weights, the fastest
algorithm for APSP runs in $O(n^{2.575})$ time for the present value of $\w$
and runs in $\Ot(n^{2.5})$ time if $\w=2+o(1)$.
  For directed graphs with {\em positive} integer weights in $\{1,...,M\}$ we
obtain a deterministic algorithm that computes the diameter in $\Ot(Mn^\w)$
time. This extends a simple $\Ot(n^\w)$ algorithm for computing the diameter of
an {\em unweighted} directed graph to the positive integer weighted setting and
is the first algorithm in this setting whose time complexity matches that of
the fastest known Diameter algorithm for {\em undirected} graphs.
  The diameter algorithms are consequences of a more general result. We
construct algorithms that for any given integer $d$, report all ordered pairs
of vertices having distance {\em at most} $d$. The diameter can therefore be
computed using binary search for the smallest $d$ for which all pairs are
reported.

sensitivity to magnetic fields from rotational quantum number, branch, and the

We also compare results from com-putations with those from observations. We use
high resolution CRIRES spectra of the two M dwarfs GJ1002 (M5.5 inactive) and
GJ1224 (M4.5 active). Individual lines are fitted by Gaussians and the obtained

field and the other with a 2 kG magnetic field vector used in the disc
integration (i.e. pure radial at the disc center). We found, in agreement with
theory, that lines with high {\Omega} show strong sensitivity to magnetic

through the wires by the scattering-matrix method, and we find the Landauer
conductance for a large ensemble of disordered wires. We study the
impurity-free wire whose edges have a roughness correlation length comparable
with the Fermi wave length. The mean resistance <\rho> and inverse mean
conductance 1/<g> are evaluated in dependence on L. For L -> 0 we observe the
quasi-ballistic dependence 1/<g> = <\rho> = 1/N_c + \rho_{qb} L/W, where 1/N_c
is the fundamental contact resistance and \rho_{qb} is the quasi-ballistic
resistivity. As L increases, we observe crossover to the diffusive dependence
1/<g> = <\rho> = 1/N^{eff}_c + \rho_{dif} L/W, where \rho_{dif} is the
resistivity and 1/N^{eff}_c is the effective contact resistance corresponding
to the N^{eff}_c open channels. We find the universal results
\rho_{qb}/\rho_{dif} = 0.6N_c and N^{eff}_c = 6 for N_c >> 1. As L exceeds the
localization length \xi, the resistance shows onset of localization while the
conductance shows the diffusive dependence 1/<g> = 1/N^{eff}_c + \rho_{dif} L/W

the semiclassical Boltzmann equation, and we compare the semiclassical electron
mean-free path with the mean free path obtained from the quantum resistivity

roughness they strongly differ, i.e., the diffusive transport is not
semiclassical. It becomes semiclassical for the edge roughness with large
correlation length.

expressed through the three parameters - the coupling constant $\alpha_{X}$,
the mass scale $M_{X}$ which defines the mass of $X$-particle as the mediator
of after-GUT interaction, and the energy imparted to the decay products. We
show that the masses of dark matter particle $m_{\chi}\approx 5$ GeV and

star members in 6 fields that cover an area 18.84 deg^2, with a typical
accuracy of ~2 km/s. Motivated by recent numerical models of the Sgr tidal
stream that predict a substantial amount of rotation in the dwarf remnant core,
we compare the kinematic data against N-body models that simulate the stream
progenitor as (i) a pressure-supported, mass-follows-light system, and (ii) a
late-type, rotating disc galaxy embedded in an extended dark matter halo. We
find that the models with little, or no intrinsic rotation clearly yield a
better match to the mean line-of-sight velocity in all surveyed fields, but
fail to reproduce the shape of the line-of-sight velocity distribution. This
result rules out models wherein the prominent bifurcation observed in the
leading tail of the Sgr stream was caused by a transfer from intrinsic angular
momentum from the progenitor satellite into the tidal stream. It also implies
that the trajectory of the young tidal tails has not been affected by internal
rotation in the progenitor system. Our finding indicates that new, more
elaborate dynamical models, in which the dark and luminous components are
treated independently, are necessary for simultaneously reproducing both the
internal kinematics of the Sgr dwarf and the available data for the associated
tidal stream.

Small grain sizes have been maintained in spite of consolidation. Nevertheless,

different stellar populations in the Magellanic Clouds. The results from
modelling the Magellanic Clouds can be useful, among others, for simulations
during the Gaia mission preparation. Isodensity contour maps have been used in
order to trace the morphology of the different stellar populations and estimate
the size of these structures. Moreover, star density maps are constructed
through star counts and projected radial density profiles are obtained. Fitting
exponential disk and King law curves to the spatial distribution allows us to
derive the structural parameters that describe these profiles. The
morphological structure and spatial distributions of various stellar components
in the Magellanic Clouds (young and intermediate age stars, carbon stars) along
with the overall spatial distribution in both Clouds are provided.

Technology Telescope (NTT) and the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), in
conjunction with the SDSS-II Supernova Survey, are analysed. We use spectral
indicators measured up to a month after the lightcurve peak luminosity to
characterise the supernova properties, and examine these for potential
correlations with host galaxy type, lightcurve shape, colour excess, and
redshift. Methods: Our analysis is based on 89 Type Ia supernovae at a redshift
interval z = 0.05 - 0.3, for which multiband SDSS photometry is available. A
lower-z spectroscopy reference sample was used for comparisons over cosmic
time. We present measurements of time series of pseudo equivalent widths and
line velocities of the main spectral features in Type Ia supernovae. Results:
Supernovae with shallower features are found predominantly among the
intrinsically brighter slow declining supernovae. We detect the strongest
correlation between lightcurve stretch and the Si ii 4000 absorption feature,
which also correlates with the estimated mass and star formation rate of the
host galaxy. We also report a tentative correlation between colour excess and
spectral properties. If confirmed, this would suggest that moderate reddening
of Type Ia supernovae is dominated by effects in the explosion or its immediate
environment, as opposed to extinction by interstellar dust.

describing the matter distribution depends on scale, being strongly
non-Gaussian on small scales (< 0.1 h^{-1} Mpc) and closely lognormal on scales
>~10 h^{-1} Mpc. The first step consists on performing 1D highly resolved
matter density reconstructions along the line-of-sight towards z~2-3 quasars

Poisson/Gamma-lognormal model, while redshift distortions are corrected with
linear Lagrangian perturbation theory. The power-spectrum of the lognormal
transformed variable which is Gaussian distributed (and thus close to the

equations. A widely accepted model is the Cuerno-Barabasi model which is robust
in its predictions of sputtered surface morphologies. An understanding of the
factors responsible for such surface topographies can be achieved by using
scaling arguments on the stochastic model. For such explanations, knowledge of
the coefficients is crucial. The more so since these vary with different
materials, the sputtering process itself generates non-equilibrium surfaces
within some finite timescale, and the implication of recent results of surface
topographies unexplained by the continuum theory. We calculate and study these
coefficients as functions of the sputtering parameters for yet unreported cases
of anisotropic ion energy distribution within the sputtered material.
Consequently, we present phase diagrams for the significant case of anisotropic
ion straggle. We observe shifts in the phase boundaries when the collision
cascade geometry rotates, and we also found saturation behavior in the

depths. Our results indicate a possible origin of yet unexplained nanodot

are assumed to be initially in their ground states with a large (but otherwise
arbitrary) internuclear separation of R = 100 a.u. (5.29 nm). Two types of a
spatial envelope of a laser field linearly po- larized along the z-axis are
considered: (i) a broad Gaussian envelope, such that atom A is excited by the
laser field predominantly, and (ii) a narrow envelope, such that practically
only atom A is excited by the laser field. With the laser carrier frequency
{\omega} = 1.0 a.u. and the pulse duration tp = 5 fs, in both cases an
efficient energy transfer from atom A to atom B has been found. The ionization
of atom B achieved mostly after the end of the laser pulse is close to or even
higher than that of atom A. It is shown that with a narrow spatial envelope of
the laser field, the underlying mechanisms of the energy transfer from A to B
and the ionization of B are the Coulomb attraction of the laser driven electron
by the proton of atom B and a short-range Coulomb repulsion of the two
electrons when their wave functions significantly overlap in the domain of atom
B. In the case of a broad Gaussian spatial envelope of the laser field, the
opposite process also occurs, but with smaller probability: the energy is
transferred from the weakly excited atom B to atom A, and the ionization of
atom A is also induced by the electron-electron repulsion in the domain of atom
A due to a strong overlap of the electronic wave functions.

an algorithm that uses 2^O(k^2)n^O(1) time and polynomial space to decide
whether a claw-free graph on n vertices has a dominating set of size at most k.
Note that this parameterization of dominating set is W[2]-hard on the set of
all graphs, and thus is unlikely to have an FPT algorithm for graphs in
general. The most general class of graphs for which an FPT algorithm was
previously known for this parameterization of dominating set is the class of
K(i,j)-free graphs, which exclude, for some fixed i,j, the complete bipartite
graph K(i,j) as a subgraph. For i,i >= 2, the class of claw-free graphs and any
class of K(i,j)-free graphs are not comparable with respect to set inclusion.
We thus extend the range of graphs over which this parameterization of
dominating set is known to be fixed-parameter tractable. We also show that, in
some sense, it is the presence of the claw that makes this parameterization of
the dominating set problem hard. More precisely, we show that for any t ?>= 4,
the dominating set problem parameterized by the solution size is W[2]-hard in
graphs that exclude the t-claw K(1,t) as an induced subgraph. Our arguments
also imply that the related connected dominating set and dominating clique
problems are W[2]-hard in these graph classes. Finally, we show that for any t,
the clique problem parameterized by solution size, which is W[1]-hard on
general graphs, is FPT in t-claw-free graphs. Our results add to the small and
growing collection of FPT results for graph classes defined by excluded

computation; hence protecting quantum systems against their irreversible
corruption due to environmental noise is an important open problem. Dynamical
decoupling (DD) is an effective method for reducing decoherence with a low
control overhead. It also plays an important role in quantum metrology, where
for instance it is employed in multiparameter estimation. While a sequence of
equidistant control pulses (CPMG) has been ubiquitously used for decoupling,
Uhrig recently proposed that a non-equidistant pulse sequence (UDD) may enhance
DD performance, especially for systems where the spectral density of the
environment has a sharp frequency cutoff. On the other hand, equidistant
sequences outperform UDD for soft cutoffs. The relative advantage provided by
UDD for intermediate regimes is not clear. In this paper, we analyze the
relative DD performance in this regime experimentally, using solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance. Our system-qubits are 13C nuclear spins and the
environment consists of a 1H nuclear spin-bath whose spectral density is close
to a normal (Gaussian) distribution. We find that in the presence of such a
bath, the CPMG sequence outperforms the UDD sequence. An analogy between
dynamical decoupling and interference effects in optics provides an intuitive
explanation as to why the CPMG sequence performs superior to any
non-equidistant DD sequence in the presence of this kind of environmental
noise.

  The observed orbital eccentricity distribution compared with those from four

the cosmological development in the late, quintessence/phantom, universe. First
order perturbative theory to the first order in f is employed. It turns out
that both in the Hubble factor, and in the energy density, the influence from
the turbulence fades away at late times. The divergences in these quantities
near the Big Rip behave essentially as in a non-turbulent fluid. However, for
the scale factor, the turbulence modification turns out to diverge
logarithmically. As second part of our work, we consider the full FRW equation

are valid, in particular, in the high-dimensional setting $m_1m_2\gg n$. We
show that the obtained rates are optimal up to logarithmic factors in a minimax

up to a constant factor. Finally, we show that our procedure provides an exact

purposes as well as for testing the laws of physics or exploring planetary
environments. The addition of an accelerometer on board a spacecraft provides
orbit determination specialists and physicists with an additional observable of
great interest: it measures the value of the non-gravitational acceleration
acting on the spacecraft, i.e. the departure of the probe from geodesic motion.
This technology is now routinely used for geodesy missions in Earth orbits with
electrostatic accelerometers. This article proposes a technological evolution
which consists in adding a subsystem to remove the bias of an electrostatic
accelerometer. It aims at enhancing the scientific return of interplanetary
missions in the Solar System, from the point of view of fundamental physics as
well as Solar System physics. The main part of the instrument is an
electrostatic accelerometer called MicroSTAR, which inherits mature
technologies based on Onera's experience in the field of accelerometry. This
accelerometer is mounted on a rotating stage, called Bias Rejection System,
which modulates the non-gravitational acceleration and thus permits to remove
the bias of the instrument from the signal of interest. This article presents
the motivations of this study, describes the instrument, called GAP, and the
measurement principle, and discusses the performance of the instrument as well
as integration constraints. Within a mass of 3.1 kg and an average consumption
of 3 W, it is possible to reach a precision of 1 pm s$^{-2}$ for the
acceleration measured with an integration time of five hours. Combining this
observable with the radio tracking data, it is therefore possible to compare
the motion of the spacecraft to theoretical predictions with a precision

a graph and $T$ is a set of terminals. For $t \in T$, a set of nonterminal
vertices separating $t$ from $T \setminus \{T\}$ is called an \emph{isolating
cut} of $t$. The largest among all the smallest isolating cuts is a natural
lower bound for a multiway cut of $(G,T)$. Denote this lower bound by $m$ and
let $k$ be an integer.
  In this paper we propose an $O(kn^{k+3})$ algorithm that computes a multiway
cut of $(G,T)$ of size at most $m+k$ or reports that there is no such multiway
cut. The core of the proposed algorithm is the following combinatorial result.
Let $G$ be a graph and let $X,Y$ be two disjoint subsets of vertices of $G$.
Let $m$ be the smallest size of a vertex $X-Y$ separator. Then, for the given
integer $k$, the number of \emph{important} $X-Y$ separators \cite{MarxTCS} of
size at most $m+k$ is at most $\sum_{i=0}^k{n \choose i}$.

over different time periods, this framework reveals strong correlations between
the excess of negative emotions and the evolution of communities. We observe
avalanches of emotional comments exhibiting significant self-organized critical

Dissemination of emotions by a small fraction of very active users appears to

entanglement at ambient temperature, with correlations between essential
biological units separated by distances as long as 20 Angstr\""oms. The
associated decoherence times, due to environmental influences, are found to be
of order 400 fs. This prompted some authors to connect such findings with the
possibility of some kind of quantum computation taking place in these
biological entities: within the decoherence time scales, the cell ""quantum
calculates"" the optimal ""path"" along which energy and signal would be
transported more efficiently. Prompted by these experimental results, in this
talk I remind the audience of a related topic proposed several years ago in
connection with the possible r\^ole of quantum mechanics and/or field theory on
dissipation-free energy transfer in microtubules (MT), which constitute
fundamental cell substructures. Quantum entanglement between tubulin dimers was
argued to be possible, provided there exists sufficient isolation from other
environmental cell effects. The model was based on certain ferroelectric
aspects of MT. In the talk I review the model and the associated experimental
tests so far and discuss future directions, especially in view of the algae
photo-experiments.

class of nonlinearities which covers the case of possible degeneration (or even
negativity) of the stiffness coefficient and the case of a supercritical source
term. Our main results deal with global attractors. In the case of strictly
positive stiffness factors we prove that in the natural energy space endowed
with a partially strong topology there exists a global attractor whose fractal
dimension is finite. In the non-supercritical case the partially strong
topology becomes strong and a finite dimensional attractor exists in the strong
topology of the energy space. Moreover, in this case we also establish the
existence of a fractal exponential attractor and give conditions that guarantee
the existence of a finite number of determining functionals. Our arguments
involve a recently developed method based on ""compensated"" compactness and
quasi-stability estimates.

potential as the two traps are brought together which predicts a clear optimum

$^{85}$Rb and find that the final atom number in the merged trap is maximised
with minimal heating by following the predicted optimum trajectory. Using the
magnetic merging approach allows us to create variable ratio isotopic Rb
mixtures with a single laser cooling setup by simply storing one isotope in a
magnetic trap before jumping the laser frequencies to the transitions necessary
to laser cool the second isotope. This offers a simple and cost effective way
to achieve suitable starting conditions for sympathetic cooling of $^{85}$Rb by
$^{87}$Rb towards quantum degeneracy.

  2011",,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical equations of motion that are first-order in time and conserve
energy can only be quantized after their variables have been transformed to
canonical ones, i.e., variables in which the energy is the system's
Hamiltonian. The source-free version of Maxwell's equations is purely
dynamical, first-order in time and has a well-defined nonnegative conserved
field energy, but is decidedly noncanonical, an issue that has attracted little
attention. The opposite parities of the electric and magnetic fields and
consequent curl operations that typify Maxwell's equations are especially at
odds with their being canonical fields. Transformation of the magnetic field
into the transverse part of the vector potential helps but is not sufficient;
further simple nonnegative symmetric integral transforms, which commute with
all differential operators, are needed for both fields; such transforms also
supplant the curls in the equations of motion. The canonical replacements of
the source-free electromagnetic fields remain transverse-vector fields, but are
more diffuse than their predecessors. Combined as the real and imaginary parts
of a complex field, the canonical fields prove to be the transverse-vector wave
function of a time-dependent Schroedinger equation whose Hamiltonian operator
is the quantization of the free photon's square-root relativistic energy. Thus
proper quantization of the source-free Maxwell equations is identical to second
quantization of free photons that have normal square-root energy. There is no
physical reason why first and second quantization of any relativistic free
particle ought not to proceed in precise parallel, utilizing the square-root
Hamiltonian operator. This natural procedure leaves no role for the completely
artificial Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, as accords with their grossly
unphysical properties.

well as the local FUV intensities in the molecular cloud surrounding NGC 3603
to get a coherent picture of how the gas is energized by the central stars.
Methods: The NANTEN2-4m submillimeter antenna is used to map the [CI] 1-0, 2-1
and CO 4-3, 7-6 lines in a 2' x 2' region around the young OB cluster NGC 3603
YC. These data are combined with C18O 2-1 data, HIRES-processed IRAS 60 and 100
micron maps of the FIR continuum, and Spitzer/IRAC maps. Results: The NANTEN2
observations show the presence of two molecular clumps located south-east and
south-west of the cluster and confirm the overall structure already found by
previous CS and C18O observations. We find a slight position offset of the peak
intensity of CO and [CI], and the atomic carbon appears to be further extended
compared to the molecular material. We used the HIRES far-infrared dust data to
derive a map of the FUV field heating the dust. We constrain the FUV field to
values of \chi = 3 - 6 \times 10^3 in units of the Draine field across the
clouds. Approximately 0.2 to 0.3 % of the total FUV energy is re-emitted in the
[CII] 158 {\mu}m cooling line observed by ISO. Applying LTE and escape
probability calculations, we derive temperatures (TMM1 = 43 K, TMM2 = 47 K),
column densities (N(MM1) = 0.9 \times 10^22 cm^-2, N(MM2) = 2.5 \times 10^22
cm^-2) and densities (n(MM1) = 3 \times 10^3 cm^-3, n(MM2) = 10^3 -10^4 cm^-3)
for the two observed molecular clumps MM1 and MM2. Conclusions: The cluster is
strongly interacting with the ambient molecular cloud, governing its structure
and physical conditions. A stability analysis shows the existence of
gravitationally collapsing gas clumps which should lead to star formation.
Embedded IR sources have already been observed in the outskirts of the
molecular cloud and seem to support our conclusions.
