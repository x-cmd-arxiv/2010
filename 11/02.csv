artificial flockings is proposed in terms of optimization problems. We
numerically examine genetic algorithms (GAs) to determine the optimal set of
parameters such as the weights for three essential interactions in BOIDS by
Reynolds (1987) under `zero-collision' and `no-breaking-up' constraints. As a
fitness function (the energy function) to be maximized by the GA, we choose the
so-called the $\gamma$-value of anisotropy which can be observed empirically in
typical flocks of starling. We confirm that the GA successfully finds the
solution having a large $\gamma$-value leading-up to a strong anisotropy. The
numerical experience shows that the procedure might enable us to make more
realistic and efficient artificial flocking of starling even in our personal
computers. We also evaluate two distinct types of interactions in agents,
namely, metric and topological definitions of interactions. We confirmed that
the topological definition can explain the empirical evidence much better than
the metric definition does.

systems for the widespread exchange of resources and voluminous information

peer-to-peer information sharing systems work mostly on wired networks. With
the growing number of communication-equipped mobile devices that can
self-organize into infrastructure-less communication platform, namely mobile ad
hoc networks (MANETs), peer-to-peer information sharing over MANETs becomes a
promising research area. In this paper, we propose a Region-Based structure
that enables efficient and secure peer-to-peer information sharing over MANETs.
The implementation shows that the proposed scheme is Secure, scalable,
efficient, and adaptive to node mobility and provides Reliable information

bind and engulf particles by their cell membrane. Particle engulfment involves
particle recognition by cell-surface receptors, signaling and remodeling of the
actin cytoskeleton to guide the membrane around the particle in a zipper-like
fashion. Despite the signaling complexity, phagocytosis also depends strongly
on biophysical parameters, such as particle shape, and the need for
actin-driven force generation remains poorly understood. Here, we propose a
novel, three-dimensional and stochastic biophysical model of phagocytosis, and
study the engulfment of particles of various sizes and shapes, including spiral
and rod-shaped particles reminiscent of bacteria. Highly curved shapes are not
taken up, in line with recent experimental results. Furthermore, we
surprisingly find that even without actin-driven force generation, engulfment
proceeds in a large regime of parameter values, albeit more slowly and with
highly variable phagocytic cups. We experimentally confirm these predictions
using fibroblasts, transfected with immunoreceptor FcyRIIa for engulfment of
immunoglobulin G-opsonized particles. Specifically, we compare the wild-type
receptor with a mutant receptor, unable to signal to the actin cytoskeleton.
Based on the reconstruction of phagocytic cups from imaging data, we indeed
show that cells are able to engulf small particles even without support from
biological actin-driven processes. This suggests that biochemical pathways
render the evolutionary ancient process of phagocytic highly robust, allowing
cells to engulf even very large particles. The particle-shape dependence of
phagocytosis makes a systematic investigation of host-pathogen interactions and
an efficient design of a vehicle for drug delivery possible.

mass M_200>=10^{14}h^{-1} M_sun extracted from a cosmological hydrodynamic
simulation of a LambdaCDM universe. With a few tens of redshifts per squared
comoving megaparsec within the cluster, the caustic technique, on average,
recovers the profile of the escape velocity from the cluster with better than
10 percent accuracy up to r~4 r_200. The caustic technique also recovers the
mass profile with better than 10 percent accuracy in the range (0.6-4) r_200,
but it overestimates the mass up to 70 percent at smaller radii. This
overestimate is a consequence of neglecting the radial dependence of the
filling function F_beta(r). The 1-sigma uncertainty on individual escape
velocity profiles increases from ~20 to ~50 percent when the radius increases
from r~0.1 r_200 to ~4 r_200. Individual mass profiles have 1-sigma uncertainty
between 40 and 80 percent within the radial range (0.6-4) r_200. We show that
the amplitude of these uncertainties is completely due to the assumption of
spherical symmetry, which is difficult to drop. Alternatively, we can apply the
technique to synthetic clusters obtained by stacking individual clusters: in
this case, the 1-sigma uncertainty on the escape velocity profile is smaller
than 20 percent out to 4 r_200. The caustic technique thus provides reliable
average profiles which extend to regions difficult or impossible to probe with
other techniques.

Berges et al.\ in large-$N$ scalar field theory. If we instead assume that

particles suspended in a relatively low-polar medium (5 $\lesssim \epsilon
\lesssim$ 8) directly from the deviations of particle positions inside two
time-shared optical traps. The particles are confined to optical point traps;
one is held in a stationary trap and the other particle is brought closer in
small steps while tracking the particle positions using confocal microscopy.
From the observed particle positions inside the traps we calculate the
interparticle forces using an ensemble-averaged particle displacement-force
relationship. The force measurements are confirmed by independent measurements
of the different parameters using electrophoresis and a scaling law for the
liquid-solid phase transition. When increasing the salt concentration by
exposing the sample to UV light, the force measurements agree well with the
classical DLVO theory assuming a constant surface potential. On the other hand,
when adding tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) to vary the salt concentration,
surface charge regulation seems to play an important role.

class of infinite-dimensional integral representations of classical special
functions was introduced. Precisely the special functions such as Whittaker
functions and Gamma-function were identified with correlation functions in
topological field theories on a two-dimensional disk. Mirror symmetry of the
underlying topological field theory leads to a dual finite-dimensional integral
representations reproducing classical integral representations for the
corresponding special functions. The mirror symmetry interchanging infinite-
and finite-dimensional integral representations provides an incarnation of the
local Archimedean Langlands duality on the level of classical special
functions. In this note we provide some directions to higher-dimensional
generalizations of our previous results. In the first part we consider
topological field theory representations of multiple local L-factors introduced
by Kurokawa and expressed through multiple Barnes's Gamma-functions. In the
second part we are dealing with generalizations based on consideration of
topological Yang-Mills theories on non-compact four-dimensional manifolds.
Presumably, in analogy with the mirror duality in two-dimensions, S-dual
description should be instrumental for deriving integral representations for a
particular class of quantum field theory correlation functions and thus
providing a new interesting class of special functions supplied with canonical
integral representations.

calculate the parameter estimation errors using the Fisher Matrix formalism and
present results of a Monte Carlo simulation of these errors over choices for
the extrinsic parameters of the source. These results are obtained using two
different models for the gravitational waveform which were introduced in paper
I of this series. These two waveform models include the inspiral, merger and
ringdown phases in a consistent way. One of the models, based on the transition
scheme of Ori & Thorne [1], is valid for IMBHs of arbitrary spin, whereas the
second model, based on the Effective One Body (EOB) approach, has been
developed to cross-check our results in the non-spinning limit. In paper I of
this series, we demonstrated the excellent agreement in both phase and
amplitude between these two models for non-spinning black holes, and that their
predictions for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are consistent to within ten
percent. We now use these models to estimate parameter estimation errors for
binary systems with masses 1.4+100, 10+100, 1.4+500 and 10+500 solar masses
(SMs), and various choices for the spin of the central intermediate-mass black
hole (IMBH). Assuming a detector network of three ETs, the analysis shows that
for a 10 SM compact object (CO) inspiralling into a 100 SM IMBH with spin
q=0.3, detected with an SNR of 30, we should be able to determine the CO and
IMBH masses, and the IMBH spin magnitude to fractional accuracies of 0.001,
0.0003, and 0.001, respectively. We also expect to determine the location of
the source in the sky and the luminosity distance to within 0.003 steradians,

we search in time for CMEs which occur 10-80 minutes afterward, and we further
require the flare and CME to occur within +/-45 degrees in position angle on
the solar disk. There are 826 CME/flare pairs which fit these criteria.
Comparing the flare fluxes with CME masses of these paired events, we find CME
mass increases with flare flux, following an approximately log-linear, broken
relationship: in the limit of lower flare fluxes, log(CME mass)~0.68*log(flare
flux), and in the limit of higher flare fluxes, log(CME mass)~0.33*log(flare
flux). We show that this broken power-law, and in particular the flatter slope
at higher flare fluxes, may be due to an observational bias against CMEs
associated with the most energetic flares: halo CMEs. Correcting for this bias
yields a single power-law relationship of the form log(CME mass)~0.70*log(flare
flux). This function describes the relationship between CME mass and flare flux
over at least 3 dex in flare flux, from ~10^-7 to 10^-4 W m^-2.

photometric conditions is between 4-20 E-17 erg/s/sq.cm depending on the
wavelength, and Ly-alpha luminosities between 3-6 E42 erg/s are detectable.
This survey method complements narrowband and color-selection techniques in the
search for high redshift galaxies with its different selection properties and
large volume probed. The four survey fields within the COSMOS, GOODS-N, MUNICS,
and XMM-LSS areas are rich with existing, complementary data. We find 104
galaxies via their high redshift Ly-alpha emission at 1.9<z<3.8, and the
majority of the remainder objects are low redshift [OII]3727 emitters at
z<0.56. The classification between low and high redshift objects depends on
rest frame equivalent width, as well as other indicators, where available.
Based on matches to X-ray catalogs, the active galactic nuclei (AGN) fraction
amongst the Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) is 6%. We also analyze the survey's
completeness and contamination properties through simulations. We find five
high-z, highly-significant, resolved objects with full-width-half-maximum sizes

high-z objects with rest frame Ly-alpha equivalent widths above the level

eccentric transiting planets. We present phase variations for a variety of
different radiative times and wind speeds. In the limit of instant
re-radiation, the light curve morphology is entirely dictated by the planet's
eccentricity and argument of pericenter: the light curve maximum leads or
trails the eclipse depending on whether the planet is receding from or
approaching the star at superior conjunction, respectively. For a planet with
non-zero radiative timescales, the phase peak occurs early for super- rotating
winds, and late for sub-rotating winds. We find that for a circular orbit, the
timing of the phase variation maximum with respect to superior conjunction
indicates the direction of the dominant winds, but cannot break the degeneracy
between wind speed and radiative time. For circular planets the phase minimum
occurs half an orbit away from the phase maximum -despite the fact that the
coolest longitudes are always near the dawn terminator- and therefore does not
convey any additional information. In general, increasing the advective
frequency or the radiative time has the effect of reducing the peak-to-trough
amplitude of phase variations, but there are interesting exceptions to these
trends. Lastly, eccentric planets with orbital periods significantly longer
than their radiative time exhibit ""ringing"" whereby the hot spot generated at
periastron rotates in and out of view. The existence of ringing makes it
possible to directly measure the wind speed (the frequency of the ringing) and
the radiative time constant (the damping of the ringing).

($9.5%\pm 5.0%$). The properties of the HDP quasars in these two samples are
consistent with the XMM-COSMOS sample, except that, at the $99% (\sim
2.5\sigma)$ significance, a larger proportion of the HDP quasars in the
Spitzer/SDSS sample have weak host galaxy contributions, probably due to the
selection criteria used. Either the host-dust is destroyed (dynamically or by
radiation), or is offset from the central black hole due to recoiling.
Alternatively, the universality of HDP quasars in samples with different
selection methods and the continuous distribution of dust covering factor in
type 1 AGNs, suggest that the range of SEDs could be related to the range of
tilts in warped fueling disks, as in the model of Lawrence and Elvis (2010),

emitting galaxies (LAEs) at z ~ 2.3 discovered with the HETDEX pilot survey. We
detect Halpha, [OIII], and Hbeta emission from two galaxies at z = 2.29 and
2.49, designated HPS194 and HPS256, respectively, representing the first
detection of multiple rest-frame optical emission lines in galaxies at
high-redshift selected on the basis of their Lyman alpha emission. The
redshifts of the Lyman alpha emission from these galaxies are offset redward of
the systemic redshifts by Delta_v = 162 +/- 37 (photometric) +/- 42
(systematic) km/s for HPS194, and Delta_v = 36 +/- 35 +/- 18 km/s for HPS256.
An interpretation for HPS194 is that a large-scale outflow may be occurring in
its interstellar medium. The emission line ratios imply that neither LAE hosts
an active galactic nucleus. Using the upper limits on the [NII] emission we
place meaningful constraints on the gas-phase metallicities in these two LAEs
of Z < 0.17 and < 0.28 Zsol (1 sigma). Measuring the stellar masses of these
objects via spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting (~ 10^10 and 6 x 10^8
Msol, respectively), we study the nature of LAEs in a mass-metallicity plane.
At least one of these two LAEs appears to be more metal poor than
continuum-selected star-forming galaxies at the same redshift and stellar mass,
implying that objects exhibiting Lyman alpha emission may be systematically
less chemically enriched than the general galaxy population. We use the SEDs of
these two galaxies to show that neglecting the emission lines when fitting
stellar population models to the observed photometry can result in
overestimates of the population age by orders of magnitude, and the stellar
mass by a factor of ~ 2. This effect is particularly important at z > 7, where
similarly strong emission lines may masquerade in the photometry as a 4000 A
break (abridged).

allowing for a measurement of disk scale lengths using surface brightness

follow mass as previous models have assumed. We demonstrate that these
simulated disks are an excellent match to the observed magnitude - size
relation for both local disks, and for disks at z=1 in the magnitude/mass range
of overlap. We disentangle the evolution seen in the population as a whole from
the evolution of individual disk galaxies. In agreement with observations, our
simulated disks undergo roughly 1.5 magnitudes/arcsec^2 of surface brightness
dimming since z=1. We find evidence that evolution in the magnitude - size
plane varies by mass, such that galaxies with M* > 10^9 M_sun undergo more
evolution in size than luminosity, while dwarf galaxies tend to evolve
potentially more in luminosity. The disks grow in such a way as to stay on
roughly the same stellar mass - size relation with time. Finally, due to an
evolving stellar mass - SFR relation, a galaxy at a given stellar mass (or
size) at z=1 will reside in a more massive halo and have a higher SFR, and thus
a higher luminosity, than a counterpart of the same stellar mass at z=0.

However, the galactic winds are critical for their subsequent evolution. The
giant clumps we obtain are short-lived and are disrupted by wind-driven mass
loss. They do not virialise or migrate to the galaxy centers as suggested in
recent work neglecting strong winds. By phenomenologically implementing the
winds that are observed from high-redshift galaxies and in particular from
individual clumps, our simulations reproduce well new observational constraints
on clump kinematics and clump ages. In particular, the observation that older
clumps appear closer to their galaxy centers is reproduced in our simulations,
as a result of inside-out formation of the disks rather than inward clump
migration.

paradigm has led to a degeneracy problem: many different inflationary
Lagrangians generate the same perturbation spectra. Resolving this problem
requires the future discovery of additional observables, beyond the scalar
adiabatic and tensor two-point functions on CMB scales. One important source of
degeneracy arises in models where the density perturbation is generated by a
non-inflationary degree of freedom, for example, through curvatons or modulated
reheating. We consider the curvaton scenario as representative of this class,
and analyze the degeneracy with single field, canonical inflation that results
if the curvaton goes undetected by future observations. We perform Monte Carlo
potential reconstructions in the absence of distinguishing observables, such as
non-Gaussiantities or isocurvature modes. The resulting degeneracy is
considerable and the improved measurements of spectral parameters from future
probes like CMBPol, offer little to better the situation. Given a
degeneracy-breaking observation, the observables must still be inverted to
obtain the inflationary potential, with different observations resulting in
reconstructions of varying quality. We find that a future detection of
isocurvature modes or a precision measurement of the tensor spectral index will
enable the most successful reconstructions in the presence of curvatons.

and positrons (e+/-) through pion-producing collisions with gas atoms. Any
synchrotron or Inverse Compton (IC) radiation from secondary e+/- is therefore
accompanied by pionic gamma-rays. Using the extragalactic gamma-ray background,
we constrain the contribution of secondary e+/- to the cosmic radio, X-ray, and
soft gamma-ray backgrounds. These bounds depend on the unknown hadronic
contribution to the gamma-ray background and the backgrounds' source redshifts.
With our assumptions, we find that IC-upscattered light from secondaries is <~
1/4 of the MeV - GeV gamma-ray background and <~ 10% of the 0.5 keV - 1 MeV
background (for sources at a redshift z <~ 10). The low intensity of the
observed gamma-ray background is marginally inconsistent with a secondary e+/-
origin for the radio background reported by ARCADE at ~3 GHz, unless the
magnetic field strength in their sources is milliGauss or greater. These limits
on the magnetic field strength are sensitive to uncertainties. However, any
contribution to the gamma-ray background from sources not responsible for the
ARCADE excess increases the inconsistency.

be detected even in deep exposures with JWST. The light collected with JWST may
therefore be dominated by radiation from galaxies inside ten times more massive
halos. We use cosmological zoomed smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations
to investigate the assembly of such galaxies and assess their observability
with JWST. We compare two simulations that are identical except for the
inclusion of non-equilibrium H/D chemistry and radiative cooling by molecular
hydrogen. In both simulations a large fraction of the halo gas settles in two
nested, extended gas disks which surround a compact massive gas core. The
presence of molecular hydrogen allows the disk gas to reach low temperatures
and to develop marked spiral structure but does not qualitatively change its
stability against fragmentation. We post-process the simulated galaxies by
combining idealized models for star formation with stellar population synthesis
models to estimate the luminosities in nebular recombination lines as well as
in the ultraviolet continuum. We demonstrate that JWST will be able to
constrain the nature of the stellar populations in galaxies such as simulated
here based on the detection of the He1640 recombination line. Extrapolation of
our results to halos with masses both lower and higher than those simulated
shows that JWST may find up to a thousand star-bursting galaxies in future deep
exposures of the z > 10 universe.

significantly refined measurement of the stellar mean density. We compare
stellar isochrones to this density estimate and find M_s = 1.275 +/- 0.018

similar studies that will be enabled by the NASA Kepler Mission.

through specific species that have large photodissociation cross sections at

decreased by an order of magnitude or more due to the presence of Lyman alpha

this paper we first establish the relative completeness of the finite

finite automata. The method is shown to be at least as powerful as known
methods based on monotonic abstraction and symbolic backward reachability.
Further, we extend the relative completeness of the approach and show that it

by fusing data from a multitude of distinct, but possibly unreliable sensors.
Recovering information from the maximum number of dependable sensors while
specifying the unreliable ones is critical for robust sensing. This sensing
task is formulated here as that of finding the maximum number of feasible
subsystems of linear equations, and proved to be NP-hard. Useful links are
established with compressive sampling, which aims at recovering vectors that
are sparse. In contrast, the signals here are not sparse, but give rise to
sparse residuals. Capitalizing on this form of sparsity, four sensing schemes
with complementary strengths are developed. The first scheme is a convex
relaxation of the original problem expressed as a second-order cone program
(SOCP). It is shown that when the involved sensing matrices are Gaussian and
the reliable measurements are sufficiently many, the SOCP can recover the
optimal solution with overwhelming probability. The second scheme is obtained
by replacing the initial objective function with a concave one. The third and
fourth schemes are tailored for noisy sensor data. The noisy case is cast as a
combinatorial problem that is subsequently surrogated by a (weighted) SOCP.
Interestingly, the derived cost functions fall into the framework of robust
multivariate linear regression, while an efficient block-coordinate descent
algorithm is developed for their minimization. The robust sensing capabilities
of all schemes are verified by simulated tests.

consider the effects of laser phase noise in a parametric cavity driving scheme
that minimizes the back-action heating of one of the quadratures of the
mechanical oscillator motion. Laser linewidths narrow compared to the decay
rate of the cavity field will not pose any problems in an experimental setting,
but broader linewidths limit the practicality of this back-action evasion
method.

a bubble (built up over the previous years) and subsequent crash in this market

is tensorially equivalent to the category Rep_k G of finite dimensional
representations of some affine group scheme G and field k, and conversely.
  Originally motivated by an attempt to find a first-order explanation for
generic cohomology of algebraic groups, we study neutral tannakian categories
as abstract first-order structures and, in particular, ultraproducts of them.
One of the main theorems of this dissertation is that certain naturally
definable subcategories of these ultraproducts are themselves neutral tannakian
categories, hence tensorially equivalent to Comod_A for some Hopf algebra A
over a field k. We are able to give a fairly tidy description of the
representing Hopf algebras of these categories, and explicitly compute them in
several examples.
  For the second half of this dissertation we turn our attention to the
representation theories of certain unipotent algebraic groups, namely the
additive group G_a and the Heisenberg group H_1. The results we obtain for
these groups in characteristic zero are not at all new or surprising, but in
positive characteristic they perhaps are. In both cases we obtain that, for a
given dimension n, if p is large enough with respect to n, all n-dimensional
modules for these groups in characteristic p are given by commuting products of
representations, with the constituent factors resembling representations of the
same group in characteristic zero. We later use these results to extrapolate
some generic cohomology results for these particular unipotent groups.

which run fast, use small amount of space, provide accurate estimates of the

combine the sampling algorithm of Tsourakakis et al. and the partitioning of
the set of vertices into a high degree and a low degree subset respectively as
in the Alon, Yuster and Zwick work treating each set appropriately. We obtain a
running time $O \left(m + \frac{m^{3/2} \Delta \log{n}}{t \epsilon^2} \right)$
and an $\epsilon$ approximation (multiplicative error), where $n$ is the number
of vertices, $m$ the number of edges and $\Delta$ the maximum number of
triangles an edge is contained.
  Furthermore, we show how this algorithm can be adapted to the semistreaming
model with space usage $O\left(m^{1/2}\log{n} + \frac{m^{3/2} \Delta \log{n}}{t

electromagnetic fields in a cavity [1-3] and the mechanical modes of a trapped
atom [4] or macroscopic solid [5]. Quantized interaction between two motional
modes of an individual trapped ion has been achieved by coupling through
optical fields [6], and entangled motion of two ions in separate locations has
been accomplished indirectly through their internal states [7]. However, direct
controllable coupling between quantized mechanical oscillators held in separate
locations has not been realized previously. Here we implement such coupling
through the mutual Coulomb interaction of two ions held in trapping potentials
separated by 40 um (similar work is reported in a related paper [8]). By tuning
the confining wells into resonance, energy is exchanged between the ions at the
quantum level, establishing that direct coherent motional coupling is possible

We resolve the main core into two components, FIR 5A and FIR 5B. A possible
explanation for the asymmetrical field lies in depolarization effects due to
the lack of internal heating from FIR 5B source, which may be in a prestellar
evolutionary state. The field strength was estimated to be 2.2 mG, in agreement
with previous BIMA data. We discuss the influence of a nearby H{\sc ii} region
over the field lines at scales of $\sim 0.01$ pc. Although the hot component is
probably compressing the molecular gas where the dust core is embedded, it is
unlikely that the radiation pressure exceeds the magnetic tension. Finally, a
complex outflow morphology is observed in CO (3 $\rightarrow$ 2) maps. Unlike
previous maps, several features associated with dust condensations other than
FIR 5 are detected.

these data, and other NICMOS exoplanet spectroscopy measurements, have been
reexamined in Gibson et al. 2010, who claim that the features in the

opacities. We examine the methods used by the Gibson team and show that,
contrary to their claim, their results for the transmission spectrum of HD
189733b are in fact in agreement with the original results. In the case of HD
189733b, the most significant problem with the Gibson approach is a poorly
determined instrument model, which causes (1) an increase in the formal
uncertainty and (2) instability in the minimization process; although Gibson et
al. do recover the correct spectrum, they cannot identify it due to the
problems caused by a poorly determined instrument model. In the case of XO-1b,
the Gibson method is fundamentally flawed because they omit the most important
parameters from the instrument model. For HD 189733b, the Gibson team did not
omit these parameters, which explains why they are able to reproduce previous
results in this case, although with poor SNR.

that in a $\La>0$ universe, the term `extremal black hole' refers to a black
hole with angular momentum $J > M^2 $. We obtain explicit numerical results for
the black hole's maximal spin value and get a distribution of admissible Kerr
holes in the ($\Lambda$, spin) parameter space. We look at the conformal
structure of the extended spacetime and the embedding of the 3-geometry of the
spatial hypersurfaces. In analogy with Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m -de Sitter

Hence the gravitational field of the Earth is inhomogeneous, and possesses a
tidal component. The free fall of an extended quantum mechanical object such as
a hydrogen atom prepared in a high principal-quantum-number state, i.e. a
circular Rydberg atom, is predicted to fall more slowly than a classical
point-like object, when both objects are dropped from the same height above the
Earth's surface. This indicates that, apart from transitions between quantum
states, the atom exhibits a kind of quantum mechanical incompressibility during
free fall in inhomogeneous, tidal gravitational fields like those of the Earth.
  A superconducting ring-like system with a persistent current circulating
around it behaves like the circular Rydberg atom during free fall. Like the
electronic wavefunction of the freely falling atom, the Cooper-pair
wavefunction is quantum mechanically incompressible. The ions in the lattice of
the superconductor, however, are not incompressible, since they do not possess
a globally coherent quantum phase. The resulting difference during free fall in
the response of the nonlocalizable Cooper pairs of electrons and the
localizable ions to inhomogeneous gravitational fields is predicted to lead to
a charge separation effect, which in turn leads to a large Coulomb force that
opposes the convergence caused by the tidal gravitational force on the
superconducting system.
  A ""Cavendish-like"" experiment is proposed for observing the charge separation
effect induced by inhomogeneous gravitational fields in a superconducting
circuit. The charge separation effect is determined to be limited by a
pair-breaking process that occurs when low frequency gravitational
perturbations are present.

a natural way with notions like compartments and membranes, which are not easy

often based on stochastic simulation methods. Recently, it has also become
evident that stochastic effects in regulatory networks play a crucial role in
the analysis of such systems. Actually, in many situations it is necessary to
use stochastic models. For example when the system to be described is based on
the interaction of few molecules, when we are at the presence of a chemical
instability, or when we want to simulate the functioning of a pool of entities

metabolic networks, involving a large number of reagents, for which the
computational cost of a stochastic simulation becomes an insurmountable

reduce the combinatorial complexity by quotienting the reachable set of
molecular species, into species aggregates while preserving the deterministic
semantics of the thermodynamic limit. Recently we proposed a quotienting that
also preserves the stochastic semantics and that is complete in the sense that
the semantics of individual species can be recovered from the aggregate

of debate. With the realization that dead zones are robust features of
protoplanetary disks, the search for hydrodynamical sources of turbulence
continues. A possible source is the baroclinic instability (BI), which has been
shown to exist in unmagnetized non-barotropic disks. We present shearing box
simulations of baroclinicly unstable, magnetized, 3D disks, in order to assess
the interplay between the BI and other instabilities, namely the
magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and the magneto-elliptical instability. We
find that the vortices generated and sustained by the baroclinic instability in
the purely hydrodynamical regime do not survive when magnetic fields are
included. The MRI by far supersedes the BI in growth rate and strength at
saturation. The resulting turbulence is virtually identical to an MRI-only
scenario. We measured the intrinsic vorticity profile of the vortex, finding
little radial variation in the vortex core. Nevertheless, the core is disrupted
by an MHD instability, which we identify with the magneto-elliptic instability.
This instability has nearly the same range of unstable wavelengths as the MRI,
but has higher growth rates. In fact, we identify the MRI as a limiting case of
the magneto-elliptic instability, when the vortex aspect ratio tends to
infinity (pure shear flow). We conclude that vortex excitation and
self-sustenance by the baroclinic instability in protoplanetary disks is viable
only in low ionization, i.e., the dead zone. Our results are thus in accordance
with the layered accretion paradigm. A baroclinicly unstable dead zone should
be characterized by the presence of large-scale vortices whose cores are
elliptically unstable, yet sustained by the baroclinic feedback. As magnetic
fields destroy the vortices and the MRI outweighs the BI, the active layers are
unmodified.

the non-unitary and non-cyclic geometric phases for two nonlinear coherent and
one squeezed states are formulated respectively. Moreover, some of their common
properties are discussed respectively, such as gauge invariance, non-locality
and non-linear effects. The non-linear functions have dramatic impacts on the
evolution of the corresponding geometric phases. They speed the evolution up or
down. So this property may have application in controlling or measuring
geometric phase. For the squeezed case, when the squeezed parameter r ->
\infinity, the limiting value of the geometric phase is also determined by
non-linear function at a given time and angular velocity. In addition, the
geometric phases for standard coherent and squeezed states are obtained under a
particular condition. When the time evolution undergoes a period, their
corresponding cyclic geometric phases are achieved as well. And the distinction
between the geometric phases of the two coherent states maybe regarded as a
geometric criterion.

properties of SST J1604+4304 which is a young infrared (IR) galaxy at z = 1.
The SN extinction curves used in this work were obtained from models of unmixed
ejecta of type II supernovae(SNe II) for the Salpeter initial mass function
(IMF) with a mass range from 8 to 30 M_sun or 8 to 40 M_sun.
  The effect of dust distributions on the attenuation of starlight is
investigated by performing the chi-square fitting method against various dust
distributions. These are the commonly used uniform dust screen, the clumpy dust
screen, and the internal dust geometry. We add to these geometries three
scattering properties, namely, no-scattering, isotropic scattering, and
forward-only scattering. Judging from the chi-square values, we find that the
uniform screen models with any scattering property provide good approximations
to the real dust geometry. Internal dust is inefficient to attenuate starlight
and thus cannot be the dominant source of the extinction.
  We show that the SN extinction curves reproduce the data of SST J1604+4304
comparable to or better than the Calzetti extinction curve. The Milky Way
extinction curve is not in satisfactory agreement with the data unless several
dusty clumps are in the line of sight. This trend may be explained by the
abundance of SN-origin dust in these galaxies; SN dust is the most abundant in
the young IR galaxy at z = 1, abundant in local starbursts, and less abundant
in the Galaxy. If dust in SST J1604+4304 is dominated by SN dust, the dust
production rate is about 0.1 M_sun per SN.

Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a limit space, $X_\infty$, and if $E_i$ are vector
bundles over $X_i$ endowed with metrics of Sasaki-type with a uniform upper
bound on rank, then a subsequence of the $E_i$ converges in the pointed
Gromov-Hausdorff sense to a metric space, $E_\infty$. The projection maps
$\pi_i$ converge to a limit submetry $\pi_\infty$ and the fibers converge to
its fibers; the latter may no longer be vector spaces but are homeomorphic to
$\R^k/G$, where $G$ is a closed subgroup of $O(k)$ ---called the {\em wane
group}--- that depends on the basepoint and that is defined using the holonomy
groups on the vector bundles. The norms $\mu_i=\|\cdot\|_i$ converges to a map
$\mu_{\infty}$ compatible with the re-scaling in $\R^k/G$ and the $\R$-action
on $E_i$ converges to an $\R-$action on $E_{\infty}$ compatible with the
limiting norm.
  In the special case when the sequence of vector bundles has a uniform lower
bound on holonomy radius (as in a sequence of collapsing flat tori to a
circle), the limit fibers are vector spaces. Under the opposite extreme, e.g.
when a single compact $n$-dimensional manifold is re-scaled to a point, the
limit fiber is $\R^n/H$ where $H$ is the closure of the holonomy group of the

  An appropriate notion of parallelism is given to the limiting spaces by
considering curves whose length is unchanged under the projection. The class of
such curves is invariant under the $\R$-action and each such curve preserves
norms. The existence of parallel translation along rectifiable curves with
arbitrary initial conditions is also exhibited. Uniqueness is not true in
general, but a necessary condition is given in terms of the aforementioned wane
groups $G$.

has been considered as a possible origin of the biohomochirality. It was
predicted in 1974 but has never been observed so far. Parity violation should
lead to a very tiny frequency difference in the rovibrational spectra of the
enantiomers of a chiral molecule. We have proposed to observe this predicted
frequency difference using the two photon Ramsey fringes technique on a
supersonic beam. Promising candidates for this experiment are chiral oxorhenium
complexes, which present a large effect, can be synthesized in large quantity
and enantiopure form, and can be seeded in a molecular beam. As a first step
towards our objective, a detailed spectroscopic study of methyltrioxorhenium
(MTO) has been undertaken. It is an ideal test molecule as the achiral parent
molecule of chiral candidates for the parity violation experiment. For the
187Re MTO isotopologue, a combined analysis of Fourier transform microwave and
infrared spectra as well as ultra-high resolution CO2 laser absorption spectra
enabled the assignment of 28 rotational lines and 71 rovibrational lines, some
of them with a resolved hyperfine structure. A set of spectroscopic parameters
in the ground and first excited state, including hyperfine structure constants,
was obtained for the antisymmetric Re=O stretching mode of this molecule. This
result validates the experimental approach to be followed once a chiral
derivative of MTO will be synthesized, and shows the benefit of the combination
of several spectroscopic techniques in different spectral regions, with
different set-ups and resolutions. First high resolution spectra of jet-cooled
MTO, obtained on the set-up being developed for the observation of molecular
parity violation, are shown, which constitutes a major step towards the
targeted objective.

resulting from a structural evolution of the material under shear, which leads
(from a theoretical perspective) to a non-monotonic stationnary flow curve
related to the coexistence of different states of the material under shear. In
this paper we present a scenario for shear-banding in a particular class of
complex fluids, namely foams and concentrated emulsions, which differs from
other scenarii in two important ways. First, the appearance of shear bands is
shown to be possible both without any intrinsic physical evolution of the
material (e.g. via a parameter coupled to the flow such as concentration or
entanglements) and without any finite critical shear rate below which the flow
does not remain stationary and homogeneous. Secondly, the appearance of shear
bands depends on the initial conditions, i.e., the preparation of the material.
In other words, it is history dependent. This behaviour relies on the tensorial
character of the underlying model (2D or 3D) and is triggered by an initially
inhomogeneous strain distribution in the material. The shear rate displays a
discontinuity at the band boundary, whose amplitude is history dependent and
thus depends on the sample preparation.

simulate the million atom nanostructured semiconductor devices under potential
bias using the periodic boundary conditions. To treat the non-equilibrium
condition, instead of directly calculating the scattering states from the
source and drain, we calculate the stationary states by the linear combination
of bulk band method and then decompose the stationary wave function into source
and drain injecting scattering states according to an approximated top of the
barrier splitting (TBS) scheme based on physical insight of ballistic and
tunneling transport. The decomposed electronic scattering states are then
occupied according to the source/drain Fermi-Levels to yield the occupied
electron density which is then used to solve the potential, forming a
self-consistent loop. The TBS is tested in an one-dimensional effective mass
model by comparing with the direct scattering state calculation results. It is
also tested in a three-dimensional 22 nm double gate ultra-thin-body
field-effect transistor study, by comparing the TBS-EPM result with the
non-equilibrium Green's function tight-binding result. We expected the TBS
scheme will work whenever the potential in the barrier region is smoother than
the wave function oscillations and if it does not have local minimum, thus
there is no multiple scattering as in a resonant tunneling diode, and when a
three-dimensional problem can be represented as a quasi-one-dimensional
problem, e.g., in a variable separation approximation. Using our approach, a
million atom non-equilibrium nanostructure device can be simulated with EPM on
a single processor computer.

heterogeneous, with a structure consisting of micro-domains. The presence of
quenched protein obstacles thus provides a mechanism to stabilize lipid rafts
in equilibrium. Crucial for two-dimensional random-field Ising universality is
that the obstacles are randomly distributed, and have a preferred affinity to
one of the lipid species. When these conditions are not met, standard Ising or

wave envelopes (including the relativistic electron mass increase) and the

can be excited and saturated due to modulational instability of unstable UH

due to collision and fusion among the patterns in stochastic motion.
Furthermore, these spatiotemporal features are demonstrated by the analysis of

place to higher harmonic modes with small wavelengths which, in turn, results
into the onset of Alfvenic turbulence in dusty magnetoplasmas. Such a scenario
can occur in the vicinity of Saturn's magnetosphere as many electrostatic

measured the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relation between M_2500 and L_X

with a number of recent studies, but the normalisation is lower compared to the
study of Rykoff et al. (2008b). One explanation for this difference may be the
fact that (sub)structures projected along the line-of-sight boost both the
galaxy counts and the lensing mass. Such superpositions lead to an increased
mass at a given L_X when clusters are binned by richness.

concurrent interactions with the environment. In this style, instead of waiting
for time-consuming operations to complete, the programmer makes a non-blocking
call to the operation and posts a callback task to a task buffer that is
executed later when the time-consuming operation completes. A co-operative
scheduler mediates the interaction by picking and executing callback tasks from
the task buffer to completion (and these callbacks can post further callbacks
to be executed later). Writing correct asynchronous programs is hard because
the use of callbacks, while efficient, obscures program control flow.
  We provide a formal model underlying asynchronous programs and study
verification problems for this model. We show that the safety verification
problem for finite-data asynchronous programs is expspace-complete. We show
that liveness verification for finite-data asynchronous programs is decidable
and polynomial-time equivalent to Petri Net reachability. Decidability is not
obvious, since even if the data is finite-state, asynchronous programs
constitute infinite-state transition systems: both the program stack and the
task buffer of pending asynchronous calls can be potentially unbounded.
  Our main technical construction is a polynomial-time semantics-preserving
reduction from asynchronous programs to Petri Nets and conversely. The
reduction allows the use of algorithmic techniques on Petri Nets to the
verification of asynchronous programs.
  We also study several extensions to the basic models of asynchronous programs
that are inspired by additional capabilities provided by implementations of
asynchronous libraries, and classify the decidability and undecidability of
verification questions on these extensions.

toward one edge of the total intensity profile. Over the last two decades, this
population of pulsars has raised cautions regarding the core/cone model of the
radio pulsar-emission beam which implies a high degree of order, symmetry and
geometric regularity. In this paper we reinvestigate this population ""partial
cone"" pulsars on the basis of new single pulse polarimetric observations of 39
of them, observed with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope in India and the
Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. These highly sensitive observations help us
to establish that most of these ""partial cones"" exhibit a core/cone structure

In short, we find that many of these ""partial cones"" are partial in the sense
that the emission above different areas of their polar caps can be (highly)
asymmetric. However, when studied closely we find that their emission
geometries are overall identical to core/double cone structure encountered

quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the power spectral density of 1A 1118-615,
with a centroid frequency of ~0.08 Hz. The centroid frequency of the QPO
correlates with the X-ray flux, as expected according to the most accredited
models for QPO production. For energies above ~4 keV, the QPO rms variability
decreases as the energy increases. Pulse profiles display energy dependence,
with a two-peak profile at lower energies, and a single peak at higher
energies. From spectral analysis, we confirm the presence of a cyclotron
absorption feature at ~60 keV, the highest value measured for an X-ray pulsar.
We find that the spectral parameters (photon index, cutoff energy, iron
fluorescence line strength) display a marked dependence with flux. We detect
two different levels of neutral hydrogen column density, possibly due to the Be
companion activity. We report for the first time a correlation between the
timing and spectral parameters in an X-ray pulsar. All the correlations found
between spectral/timing parameters and X-ray flux are present up to a flux of
~6x10^-9 erg cm^-2 s^-1, when a saturation level is reached. We propose that
the saturation observed corresponds to the minimum extent of the neutron star
magnetosphere. We estimate the magnetic field of the neutron star from two
independent ways, using results from spectral (cyclotron line energy) and
timing (QPO frequency) analysis, obtaining consistent values, of ~7-8x10^12 G.

alternating groups, which are powerful enough to work for modular
representations. One is based on Sergeev duality, which connects projective
representation theory of the symmetric group and representation theory of the
algebraic supergroup $Q(n)$ via appropriate Schur (super)algebras and Schur
functors.
  The second approach follows the work of Grojnowski for classical affine and
cyclotomic Hecke algebras and connects projective representation theory of
symmetric groups in characteristic $p$ to the crystal graph of the basic module
of the twisted affine Kac-Moody algebra of type $A_{p-1}^{(2)}$.
  The goal of this work is to connect the two approaches mentioned above and to
obtain new branching results for projective representations of symmetric
groups. This is achieved by developing the theory of lowering operators for the
supergroup $Q(n)$ which is parallel to (although much more intricate than) the
similar theory for $GL(n)$ developed by the first author. The theory of
lowering operators for $GL(n)$ is a non-trivial generalization of Carter's work
in characteristic zero, and it has received a lot of attention. So this part of
our work might be of independent interest.
  One of the applications of lowering operators is to tensor products of
irreducible $Q(n)$-modules with natural and dual natural modules, which leads
to important special translation functors. We describe the socles and primitive
vectors in such tensor products.

WNB1851+5707, B2 0120+33, and B2 1610+29. These sources have been selected on
the basis of their extremely steep broad-band radio spectra. The modeling of
the integrated spectra and the deep spectral index images obtained with the VLA
confirmed that in these sources the central engine has ceased to be active for
a significant fraction of their lifetime although their extended lobes have not
yet completely faded away. We found that WNB1851+5707 is in reality composed by
two distinct dying galaxies, which appear blend together as a single source in
the WENSS. In the cases of WNB1829+6911 and B2 0120+33, the fossil radio lobes
are seen in conjunction with a currently active core. A very faint core is
detected also in a MERLIN image of WNB1851+5707a, one of the two dying sources
composing WNB1851+5707. We found that all sources of our sample are located (at
least in projection) at the center of an X-ray emitting cluster. Our results
suggest that the duration of the dying phase for a radio source in cluster can
be significantly higher with respect to that of a radio galaxy in the field.
The simplest interpretation is that the low-frequency emission from the fading
radio lobes last longer if their expansion is somewhat reduced or even stopped.
Another possibility is that the occurrence of dying sources is higher in galaxy
clusters. Radio sources in dense environment, like e.g. the center of cooling
core clusters, may have a peculiar accretion mode which results in a bursting
duty cycle sequence of active and quiescent periods. This result could have
important implications for theories of the life cycles of radio sources and AGN
feedback in clusters of galaxies but awaits confirmation from future
observations of larger samples of objects.

leads to the production of a GeV-TeV gamma-ray halo centered on the source
location, through the production of a high electromagnetic component in the
interactions of the primary particles with the radiation backgrounds. This
paper examines the prospects for the detectability of such gamma ray halos. We
explore a broad range of astrophysical parameters, including the inhomogeneous
distribution of magnetic fields in the large scale structure as well as various
possible chemical compositions and injection spectra; and we consider the case
of a source located outside clusters of galaxies. With respect to the gamma-ray
flux associated to synchrotron radiation of ultra-high energy secondary pairs,
we demonstrate that it does not depend strongly on these parameters and
conclude that its magnitude ultimately depends on the energy injected in the
primary cosmic rays. Bounding the cosmic ray luminosity with the contribution
to the measured cosmic ray spectrum, we then find that the gamma-ray halo
produced by equal luminosity sources is well below current or planned
instrument sensitivities. Only rare and powerful steady sources, located at
distances larger than several hundreds of Mpc and contributing to a fraction >
10% of the flux at 10^19 eV might be detectable. We also discuss the gamma-ray
halos that are produced by inverse Compton/pair production cascades seeded by
ultra-high energy cosmic rays. This latter signal strongly depends on the
configuration of the extragalactic magnetic fields; it is dominated by the
synchrotron signal on a degree scale if the filling factor of magnetic fields

depending on the gate sweeping rate/range. It is shown here that the
transistors exhibit two different kinds of hysteresis in their electrical
characteristics. Charge transfer causes a positive shift in the gate voltage of
the minimum conductance, while capacitive gating can cause the negative shift
of conductance with respect to gate voltage. The positive hysteretic phenomena
decay with an increase of the number of layers in graphene flakes. Self-heating
in helium atmosphere significantly removes adsorbates and reduces positive
hysteresis. We also observed negative hysteresis in graphene devices at low
temperature. It is also found that an ice layer on/under graphene has much
stronger dipole moment than a water layer does. Mobile ions in the electrolyte
gate and a polarity switch in the ferroelectric gate could also cause negative
hysteresis in graphene transistors. These findings improved our understanding
of the electrical response of graphene to its surroundings. The unique
sensitivity to environment and related phenomena in graphene deserve further
studies on nonvolatile memory, electrostatic detection and chemically driven

local elliptical galaxy M32. We have obtained F435W and F555W photometry based
on HST ACS/HRC images for a region 110"" from the center of M32 and a background
field about 320"" away from M32 center. Due to the high resolution of our
Nyquist-sampled images, the small photometric errors, and the depth of our data
we obtain the most detailed resolved photometric study of M32 yet.
Deconvolution of HST images proves to be superior than other standard methods
to derive stellar photometry on extremely crowded HST images. The location of
the strong red clump in the CMD suggests a mean age between 8 and 10 Gyr for
[Fe/H] = -0.2 in M32. We detect for the first time a red giant branch bump and
an asymptotic giant branch bump in M32 which indicate that the mean age of
M32's dominant population at ~2' from its center is between 5 and 10 Gyr. We
see evidence of an intermediate-age population in M32 mainly due to the
presence of bright asymptotic giant branch stars. Our detection of a blue
component of stars (blue plume) may indicate for the first time the presence of
a young stellar population, with ages of the order of 0.5 Gyr, in our M32
field. However, it is likely that the brighter stars of this blue plume belong
to the disk of M31 rather than to M32. The fainter stars populating the blue
plume indicate the presence of stars not younger than 1 Gyr and/or blue
straggler stars in M32. M32's dominant population of 8--10 Gyr implies a
formation redshift of 1 < z_f < 2, precisely when observations of the specific
star formation rates and models of ""downsizing"" imply galaxies of M32's mass
ought to be forming their stars. Our CMD therefore provides a ""ground-truth"" of
downsizing scenarios at z=0. Our background field data represent the deepest
optical observations yet of the inner disk and bulge of M31. [Abridged]

Hamiltonian formalism. This formalism is based on the explicitly covariant
formulation of light-front dynamics, with a decomposition of the state vector
in Fock components. In order to be able to make definite predictions order by
order in the truncation of the Fock expansion, we use an appropriate Fock
sector dependent renormalization scheme. Our covariant formulation enables us
to have a strict control of any violation of rotational invariance due to the
choice of a given orientation of the light-front plane. This is mandatory in
order to define the necessary renormalization conditions, and hence to be able
to calculate physical observables. We emphasize the role played by antiparticle
degrees of freedom in order to control, order by order in the Fock expansion,
the scale invariance of physical observables. This nonperturbative framework
demands also to use an appropriate regularization scheme. We show why the
recently proposed Taylor-Lagrange regularization scheme is a very adequate
scheme since it can be implemented very naturally, and from a systematic point
of view, in light-front dynamics. As a direct application of this general
framework, we settle the basis for a new formulation of chiral effective field
theory in the baryonic sector based on light-front dynamics and a Fock
decomposition of the state vector.

Automated test data generation for programs having loops with variable number
of iteration and variable length array is a challenging problem. It is so
because the number of paths may increase exponentially with the increase of
array size for some programming constructs, like merge sort. We propose a
method that finds heuristic for different types of programming constructs with
loops and arrays. Linear search, Bubble sort, merge sort, and matrix
multiplication programs are included in an attempt to highlight the difference
in execution between single loop, variable length array and nested loops with
one and two dimensional arrays. We have used two parameters/heuristics to
predict the minimum number of iterations required for generating automated test
data. They are longest path level (kL) and saturation level (kS). The
proceedings of our work includes the instrumentation of source code at the
elementary level, followed by the application of the random inputs until all
feasible paths or all paths having longest paths are collected. However,
duplicate paths are avoided by using a filter. Our test data is the random

aspect, this situation is undesirable. That is, the system has to be designed
in such a way that image coordinate of the world coordinate point will be fixed

an elegant fashion. Firstly, camera parameters are calculated in its local
coordinate system. Then, we use global coordinate data to transfer all local
coordinate data of stereo cameras into same global coordinate system, so that
we can register everything into this global coordinate system. After all the
transformations, when the image coordinate of the world coordinate point is

hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) cannot be directly observed and measured.
Previously we modeled feline hematopoiesis using a two-compartment hidden
Markov process that had birth and emigration events in the first compartment.
Here we perform Bayesian statistical inference on models which contain two
additional events in the first compartment in order to determine if HSC fate
decisions are linked to cell division or occur independently. Pareto Optimal
Model Assessment approach is used to cross check the estimates from Bayesian
inference. Our results show that HSC must divide symmetrically (i.e., produce
two HSC daughter cells) in order to maintain hematopoiesis. We then demonstrate
that the augmented model that adds asymmetric division events provides a better
fit to the competitive transplantation data, and we thus provide evidence that
HSC fate determination in vivo occurs both in association with cell division
and at a separate point in time. Last we show that assuming each cat has a
unique set of parameters leads to either a significant decrease or a
nonsignificant increase in model fit, suggesting that the kinetic parameters
for HSC are not unique attributes of individual animals, but shared within a
species.

X-ray measurements from both Chandra and XMM with ground-based near-infrared
observations from CTIO, AAT and CFHT to compare the mass in hot gas and stars
to the dynamical mass and state of the clusters. Only 13 of the clusters are
detected in X-ray emission, and for these systems we find that a range of 7-20
per cent of their baryonic mass, and <3 per cent of their dynamical mass, is
detected in starlight, similar to what is observed in more massive clusters. In
contrast, the five undetected clusters are underluminous in X-ray emission, by
up to a factor 10, given their stellar mass. Although the velocity distribution
of cluster members in these systems is indistinguishable from a Gaussian, all
show subtle signs of being unrelaxed: either they lack a central, dominant
galaxy, or the bright galaxy distribution is less concentrated and/or more
elongated than the rest of the sample. Thus we conclude that low-mass clusters
and groups selected from the velocity distribution of their galaxies exhibit a
dichotomy in their hot gas properties. Either they are detected in X-ray, in
which case they generally lie on the usual scaling relations, or they are
completely undetected in X-ray emission. The non-detections may be partly
related to the apparently young dynamical state of the clusters, but it remains
a distinct possibility that some of these systems are exceptionally devoid of
hot emitting gas as the result of its expulsion or rarefaction.

singularity is regulated at any finite N (by the associated density
fluctuations). While previous studies have focussed on the behaviour as a
function of N of the minimal size reached during the contracting phase, we
examine in particular the size and energy of the virialized halo which results.
We find the unexpected result that the structure decreases in size as N
increases, scaling in proportion to N^{-1/3}, a behaviour which is associated
with an ejection of kinetic energy during violent relaxation which grows in
proportion to N^{1/3}. This latter scaling may be qualitatively understood, and
if it represents the asymptotic behaviour in N implies that this ejected energy
is unbounded above. We discuss also tests we have performed which indicate that
this ejection is a mean-field phenomenon (i.e. a result of collisionless

Observations were performed with the 7-channel ""Gamma-Ray Optical and

broad-band spectral energy distributions and derive rest-frame extinctions. e

optical afterglow emission of ""dark bursts"" is mainly due to a combination of

basic results on open system dynamics. Identifying memory effects in open
system evolution is gaining increasing importance recently and here, a
criterion of non-Markovianity, based on the relative entropy of the dynamical
state is proposed. The relative entropy difference of the dynamical system
serves as a complementary characterization - though not related directly - to
the fidelity difference criterion proposed recently. Three typical examples of
open system evolution of a qubit, prepared initially in a correlated state with
another qubit (environment), and evolving jointly under a specific unitary
dynamics - which corresponds to a NCP dynamical map - are investigated by
employing both the relative entropy difference and fidelity difference tests of
non-Markovianity. The two qubit initial states are chosen to be (i) a pure
entangled state, (ii) theWerner state, which exemplifies both entangled and
separable states of qubits, depending on a real parameter, and (3) a separable

along with their applications to selected problems in neuroscience. These
methods are semi-parametric in that inferences are derived by combining
sequential Bayesian updating with a non-parametric change-point test. As a test
statistic, we propose a Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence between posterior
distributions arising from different sets of data. A closed form expression of
this statistic is derived for exponential family models, whereas standard
Markov chain Monte Carlo output is used to approximate its value and its
critical region for more general models. The behavior of one-step ahead
predictive distributions under our semi-parametric framework is described
analytically for a dynamic linear time series model. Conditions under which our
approach reduces to fully parametric state-space modeling are also illustrated.
We apply our methods to estimating the functional dynamics of a wide range of
neural data, including multi-channel electroencephalogram recordings,
longitudinal behavioral experiments and in-vivo multiple spike trains
recordings. The estimated dynamics are related to the presentation of visual
stimuli, to the evaluation of a learning performance and to changes in the

has been found to exhibit outstanding electronic and mechanical properties, as
well as an unusual low-energy spectrum of Dirac quasiparticles giving rise to a
fractional quantum Hall effect when freely suspended and immersed in a magnetic
field. One of the most intriguing puzzles of graphene involves the
low-temperature conductivity at zero density, a central issue in the design of
graphene-based nanoelectronic components. While suspended graphene experiments
have shown a trend reminiscent of semiconductors, with rising resistivity at
low temperatures, most theories predict a constant or even decreasing
resistivity. However, lattice field theory calculations have revealed that
suspended graphene is at or near the critical coupling for excitonic gap
formation due to strong Coulomb interactions, which suggests a simple and
straightforward explanation for the experimental data. In this contribution we
review the current status of the field with emphasis on the issue of gap

exceptional points are discussed. Then, their role in the description of real
physical quantum systems is considered. Most interesting value is the phase
rigidity of the eigenfunctions which varies between 1 (for distant
non-overlapping states) and 0 (at the exceptional point where the resonance
states completely overlap). This variation allows the system to incorporate
environmentally induced effects. In the very neighborhood of an exceptional
point, the system can be described well by a conventional nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation. In the regime of overlapping resonances, a dynamical
phase transition takes place to which all states of the system contribute: a
few short-lived resonance states are aligned to the scattering states of the
environment by trapping the other states. The trapped resonance states show
chaotic features. Due to the alignment of a few states with the states of the
environment, observable values may be enhanced. The dynamical phase transition
allows us to understand some experimental results which remained puzzling in
the framework of conventional Hermitian quantum physics. The effects caused by
the exceptional points in physical systems allow us to manipulate them for many
different applications.

generate interest in analyzing complex spatial datasets. One area of activity
is in creating smoothed disease maps to describe the geographic variation of
disease and generate hypotheses for apparent differences in risk. With multiple
diseases, a multivariate conditionally autoregressive (MCAR) model is often
used to smooth across space while accounting for associations between the
diseases. The MCAR, however, imposes complex covariance structures that are
difficult to interpret and estimate. This article develops a much simpler
alternative approach building upon the techniques of smoothed ANOVA (SANOVA).
Instead of simply shrinking effects without any structure, here we use SANOVA
to smooth spatial random effects by taking advantage of the spatial structure.
We extend SANOVA to cases in which one factor is a spatial lattice, which is
smoothed using a CAR model, and a second factor is, for example, type of
cancer. Datasets routinely lack enough information to identify the additional
structure of MCAR. SANOVA offers a simpler and more intelligible structure than
the MCAR while performing as well. We demonstrate our approach with simulation
studies designed to compare SANOVA with different design matrices versus MCAR
with different priors. Subsequently a cancer-surveillance dataset, describing
incidence of 3-cancers in Minnesota's 87 counties, is analyzed using both
approaches, showing the competitiveness of the SANOVA approach.

CP^2 in a global geometric approach using the right invariant (left action-)
induced vector fields from SU(3). This ansatz is suitable for noncommutative
generalisation within the framework of fuzzy geometry. Along the way we
identify the physical spinors and construct the canonical spin_c bundle in this
formulation. The chirality operator is also given in two equivalent forms.
Finally, using representation theory we obtain the eigenspinors and calculate
the full spectrum. We use an argument from the fuzzy complex projective space
CP^2_F based on the fuzzy analogue of the unprojected spin_c bundle to show
that our commutative projected spin_c bundle has the correct
SU(3)-representation content.

there is a coalgebra projection $\pi$ from $A$ to a sub-Hopf algebra $H$ that
splits the inclusion. If the projection is $H$-bilinear, then $A$ is isomorphic
to a biproduct $R #_{\xi}H$ where $(R,\xi)$ is called a pre-bialgebra with
cocycle in the category $_{H}^{H}\mathcal{YD}$. The cocycle $\xi$ maps $R
\otimes R$ to $H$. Examples of this situation include the liftings of pointed
Hopf algebras with abelian group of points $\Gamma$ as classified by
Andruskiewitsch and Schneider [AS1]. One asks when such an $A$ can be twisted
by a cocycle $\gamma:A\otimes A\rightarrow K$ to obtain a Radford biproduct. By
results of Masuoka [Ma1, Ma2], and Gr\""{u}nenfelder and Mastnak [GM], this can
always be done for the pointed liftings mentioned above.
  In a previous paper [ABM1], we showed that a natural candidate for a twisting
cocycle is {$\lambda \circ \xi$} where $\lambda\in H^{\ast}$ is a total
integral for $H$ and $\xi$ is as above. We also computed the twisting cocycle
explicitly for liftings of a quantum linear plane and found some examples where
the twisting cocycle we computed was different from {$\lambda \circ \xi$}. In
this note we show that in many cases this cocycle is exactly $\lambda\circ\xi$
and give some further examples where this is not the case. As well we extend
the cocycle computation to quantum linear spaces; there is no restriction on
the dimension.

use them to calculate the cohomology of quaternionic Grassmannians. In a

determine Thom and Borel classes for all symplectic bundles, and the symplectic
Thom classes can be recovered from the Borel classes.

$G(V,E)$ with diameter $\Delta$. In round zero, a set $S\subseteq V$ of
vertices, called the seeds, are active. In round $i+1,$ $i\in\mathbb{N},$ a
non-isolated vertex is activated if at least a $\rho\in(\,0,1\,]$ fraction of
its neighbors are active in round $i$; it is deactivated otherwise. For
$k\in\mathbb{N},$ let $\text{min-seed}^{(k)}(G,\rho)$ be the minimum number of

derives upper bounds on $\text{min-seed}^{(k)}(G,\rho)$. In particular, if $G$

conductivity and the number of gapless edge modes does not hold in general, but
is dependent on the boundary conditions, even in the absence of intervalley
coupling. This non-universality is attributed to the absence of a well-defined
topological invariant within a given valley of BLG; yet, a more general
topological invariant may be defined in certain cases, which explains the
distinction between the BLG-vacuum and BLG-BLG interfaces.

spacing of chimneys -- channels devoid of solid -- in two-dimensional mushy
layers formed by solidifying a binary alloy. Chimneys are the principal
conduits through which buoyancy effects transport material out of the mushy
layer and into the liquid from which it formed. Experiments show a coarsening
of chimney spacing and we pursue the hypothesis that this observation is a
consequence of a variational principle: the chimney spacing adjusts to optimize
material transport and hence maximize the rate of removal of potential energy
stored in the mushy layer. The optimal solute flux increases approximately
linearly with the mushy layer Rayleigh number. However, for spacings below a
critical value the chimneys collapse and solute fluxes cease, revealing a
hysteresis between chimney convection and no flow.
