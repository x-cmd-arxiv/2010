stability principles for biomass in the ecosystem and for employment in
economics are mathematically similar. The ecosystem is found to have a stable
and an unstable stationary state with high (forest) and low (grasslands)
biomass, respectively. In economics, there is a stable stationary state with
high employment, which corresponds to mass production of conventional goods
sold at low cost price, and an unstable stationary state with lower employment,
which corresponds to production of novel goods appearing in the course of
technological progress. An additional stable stationary state is described for
economics, the one corresponding to very low employment in production of life
essentials such as energy and raw materials. In this state the civilization
currently pays 10% of global GDP for energy produced by a negligible minority
of the working population (currently ~0.2%) and sold at prices greatly
exceeding the cost price by 40 times. It is shown that economic ownership over
energy sources is equivalent to equating measurable variables of different
dimensions (stores and fluxes), which leads to effective violation of the laws
of energy and matter conservation.

an example of the desired new physics. We show that the wrong charge asymmetry,
$a_{sl}^s$, which is related to the dimuon asymmetry, is significantly altered
compared to the Standard Model value. However, experimental limits from $\Delta
M_s$, $\Delta\Gamma_s$ as well as $K$ mixing and electroweak corrections
constrain it to be greater than a $\sigma$ away from its experimental average

bubbles for \omega>-3/2, false vacuum bubbles for \omega<-3/2, and false vacuum
bubbles for \omega>-3/2 when the vacuum energy of the false vacuum in the

bubble is nucleated at the t=0 surface, we can smoothly interpolate the field
combinations to some solutions in the Lorentzian signature and consistently
continue their subsequent evolutions. Therefore, we conclude that, in general

channel prediction using limited CSI feedback. In addition, instead of
switching settings according to the CSI, we also provide means to combine both
CSI and FER as the switching parameter. Numerical results illustrate that the
average throughput of the proposed algorithm has significant performance
improvement over fixed modulation and coding while the CSI feedback being

2007-11d and 2007-11e) and eight with the IRS (all but 2007-07f and 2007-08a),
resulting in six in common between the two instruments. The observations, which
were obtained between ~3 and ~7 months after discovery, revealed evidence for
dust formation in two of the novae: M31N 2006-10a and (possibly) 2007-07f, and
[Ne II] 12.8 micron line emission in a third (2007-11e). The Spitzer
observations were supplemented with ground-based optical photometric and
spectroscopic data that were used to determine the speed classes and
spectroscopic types of the novae in our survey. After including data for
dust-forming Galactic novae, we show that dust formation timescales are
correlated with nova speed class in that dust typically forms earlier in faster
novae. We conclude that our failure to detect the signature of dust formation
in most of our M31 sample is likely a result of the relatively long delay
between nova eruption and our Spitzer observations. Indeed, the two novae for
which we found evidence of dust formation were the two ""slowest"" novae in our
sample. Finally, as expected, we found that the majority of the novae in our
sample belong to the Fe II spectroscopic class, with only one clear example of
the He/N class (M31N 2006-10b). Typical of an He/N system, M31N 2006-10b was
the fastest nova in our sample, not detected with the IRS, and just barely
detected in three of the IRAC bands when it was observed ~4 months after

each Cardy state of the minimal model. It was conjectured by Seiberg and Shih
that all branes in a minimal string theory could be expressed as a linear
combination of the brane associated to the identity operator of the minimal
model with complex shifts in the boundary cosmological constant. Subsequently
it was found that this identification of FZZT branes does not hold exactly for
some cylinder amplitudes but was spoiled by terms that are associated with
vanishing worldsheet area and are therefore non-universal. In this paper we
investigate this claim systematically, using both Liouville and matrix model
methods, beyond the planar limit. We find that the aforementioned
identification of FZZT branes is spoiled by terms that do not admit an
interpretation as non-universal terms. Furthermore, the spoiling terms as
computed using the matrix model are found to be in agreement with those coming
from Liouville theory, which also suggests that these terms have universal
meaning. Finally, we also investigate the identification of FZZT branes by
replacing the boundary state with a sum of local operators. We find in this
case that the brane associated with the identity operator appears to be special
as it is the only one to correctly reproduce the correlation numbers for bulk
operators on the torus.

about 245 K and shows spatially unresolved emission in complex organic
molecules, all typical of a hot molecular core. Toward MM1, redshifted
absorption is seen in molecular lines with different energies above the ground
state. This absorption probes inward motion of the dense gas toward the central
young O star, and the estimated mass accretion rate reaches 10^{-3} Msun/yr.
Multiple outflows are seen in the CO and 13CO maps. The gas mass of 50 Msun and
mass outflow rate of 2.5 by 10^{-3} Msun/yr measured in CO line wings are
dominated by the MM1 outflow, which is most likely driven by a fast wide-angle
wind. Apart from MM1, we discover eight new dusty cores, MM2--9, within a
projected distance of 0.35 pc from MM1. These cores show no counterpart in
infrared or radio continuum emission, while seven of them appear to be forming
intermediate- to high-mass stars. This manifests a deeply embedded star-forming
component of the parent cloud of IRS 1--3. Apparently we are observing a

compared to those observed in Seyfert 1s. Also, we find that the X-ray line

quantization, generation, and dynamics, the transition from a superfluid to a
normal phase and a number of other large amplitude collective modes which are
beyond the scope of two-fluid hydrodynamics, Ginzburg-Landau and/or
Gross-Pitaevskii approaches. We illustrate the power of this approach by
studying the generation of quantized vortices, vortex rings, vortex
reconnection, and transition from a superfluid to a normal state in real time
for a unitary Fermi gas. We predict the emergence of a new qualitative
phenomenon in superfluid dynamics of gases, the existence of stable
superfluidity when the systems are stirred with velocities significantly
exceeding the nominal Landau critical velocity in these systems.

single-layer hexagonal boron-nitride (BN) are presented. The armchair edges of
BN nanoribbons (BNNRs) are more stable in energy than zigzag ones. Armchair
BNNRs are under compressive edge stress while zigzag BNNRs are under tensile
edge stress. The intrinsic spin-polarization and edge saturation play important
roles in modulating the edge stability of BNNRs. The edge energy difference
between BN and graphene could be used to guide the design of the specific
hybrid BNC structures: in an armchair BNC nanoribbon (BNCNR), BN domains are
expected to grow outside of C domains, while the opposite occurs in a zigzag
BNCNR. More importantly, armchair BNCNRs can reproduce unique electronic
properties of armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which are expected to be
robust against edge functionalization or disorder. Within certain C/BN ratio,
zigzag BNCNRs may exhibit intrinsic half-metallicity without any external
constraints. These unexpected electronic properties of BNCNRs may offer unique
opportunities to develop nanoscale electronics and spintronics beyond
individual graphene and BN. Generally, these principles for designing BNC could
be extended to other hybrid nanostructures.

Hence, in this article, we introduce the application of a class of numerical
methods (termed the max-plus curse of dimensionality free techniques) that
determine the optimal control thereby synthesizing the desired unitary gate.
The application of this technique to quantum systems has a growth in complexity
that depends on the cardinality of the control set approximation rather than
the much larger growth with respect to spatial dimensions in approaches based
on gridding of the space, used in previous literature. This technique is
demonstrated by obtaining an approximate solution for the gate synthesis on

neuroevolutionary approach aimed at removing the need for speciation due to its
intrinsic population diversification effects, a new ""Targeted Tuning Phase""
aimed at dealing with ""the curse of dimensionality"", and a new Random Intensity
Mutation (RIM) method that removes the need for crossover algorithms. The paper
will discuss DXNN's architecture, mutation operators, and its built in feature
selection method that allows for the evolved systems to expand and incorporate
new sensors and actuators. I then compare DXNN to other state of the art
TWEANNs on the standard double pole balancing benchmark, and demonstrate its
superior ability to evolve highly compact solutions faster than its
competitors. Then a set of oblation experiments is performed to demonstrate how
each feature of DXNN effects its performance, followed by a set of experiments
which demonstrate the platform's ability to create NN populations with
exceptionally high diversity profiles. Finally, DXNN is used to evolve
artificial robots in a set of two dimensional open-ended food gathering and
predator-prey simulations, demonstrating the system's ability to produce ever
more complex Neural Networks, and the system's applicability to the domain of
robotics, artificial life, and coevolution.

that use multicast transmission. For a multicast routing algorithm to be
applicable in optical networks, it must route data only to group members,
optimize and maintain loop-free routes, and concentrate the routes on a subset
of network links. For an all-optical switch to play the role of a branching
router, it must be equipped with a light splitter. Light splitters are
expensive equipments and therefore it will be very expensive to implement
splitters on all optical switches. Optical light splitters are only implemented
on some optical switches. That limited availability of light splitters raises a
new problem when we want to implement multicast protocols in optical network
(because usual multicast protocols make the assumption that all nodes have
branching capabilities). Another issue is the knowledge of the locations of
light splitters in the optical network. Nodes in the network should be able to
identify the locations of light splitters scattered in the optical network so
it can construct multicast trees. These problems must be resolved by
implementing a multicast routing protocol that must take into consideration
that not all nodes can be branching node. As a result, a new signaling process
must be implemented so that light paths can be created, spanning from source to
the group members.

caused by the recent turn towards multicore processing architectures. As a
result, an increasing number of developers have to learn to write concurrent
programs, a task that is known to be hard even for the expert. Language
designers are therefore working on languages that promise to make concurrent
programming ""easier"" than using traditional thread libraries. However, the
claim that a new language is more usable than another cannot be supported by
purely theoretical considerations, but calls for empirical studies. In this
paper, we present the design of a study to compare concurrent programming
languages with respect to comprehending and debugging existing programs and
writing correct new programs. A critical challenge for such a study is avoiding
the bias that might be introduced during the training phase and when
interpreting participants' solutions. We address these issues by the use of
self-study material and an evaluation scheme that exposes any subjective
decisions of the corrector, or eliminates them altogether. We apply our design
to a comparison of two object-oriented languages for concurrency, multithreaded
Java and SCOOP (Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming), in an academic
setting. We obtain results in favor of SCOOP even though the study participants
had previous training in Java Threads.

differentiated multistage process, involving a lag phase, extensive death, and
potential adaptation. Deregulation of this chain of events is at the root of
many diseases. Improper adaptation is particularly important because it allows
cell sub-populations to survive even in the continuous presence of death
conditions, which results, among others, in the eventual failure of many
targeted anticancer therapies. Here, I show that these typical responses arise
naturally from the interplay of intracellular variability with a
threshold-based control mechanism that detects cellular changes in addition to
just the cellular state itself. Implementation of this mechanism in a
quantitative model for T-cell apoptosis, a prototypical example of programmed
cell death, captures with exceptional accuracy experimental observations for
different expression levels of the oncogene Bcl-xL and directly links
adaptation with noise in an ATP threshold below which cells die. These results
indicate that oncogenes like Bcl-xL, besides regulating absolute death values,
can have a novel role as active controllers of cell-cell variability and the
extent of adaptation.

art form technique commonly called stippling. Stippling is the art of rendering
images using point sets, possibly with various attributes like sizes,
elementary shapes, and colors. Producing nice stippling is attractive not only
for the sake of image depiction but also because it yields a compact vectorial
format for storing the semantic information of media. Moreover, stippling is by
construction easily tunable to various device resolutions without suffering
from bitmap sampling artifacts when resizing. The underlying core technique for
stippling images is to compute a centroidal Voronoi tessellation on a
well-designed underlying density. This density relates to the image content,
and is used to compute a weighted Voronoi diagram. By considering videos as
image sequences and initializing properly the stippling of one image by the
result of its predecessor, one avoids undesirable point flickering artifacts
and can produce stippled videos that nevertheless still exhibit noticeable
artifacts. To overcome this, our method improves over the naive scheme by
considering dynamic point creation and deletion according to the current scene
semantic complexity, and show how to effectively vectorize video while
adjusting for both color and contrast characteristics. Furthermore, we explain
how to produce high quality stippled ``videos'' (eg., fully dynamic
spatio-temporal point sets) for media containing various fading effects, like
quick motions of objects or progressive shot changes. We report on practical
performances of our implementation, and present several stippled video results
rendered on-the-fly using our viewer that allows both spatio-temporal dynamic
rescaling (eg., upscale vectorially frame rate).

due to the prospect of identifying fluctuations of parity-odd regions in the
field sector of QCD. Whereas the observable of interest related to parity
fluctuations involves subtracting opposite-sign from same-sign correlations,
the STAR collaboration reported the same-sign and opposite-sign correlations
separately. It is shown here how momentum conservation combined with collective
elliptic flow contributes significantly to this class of correlations, though
not to the difference between the opposite- and same-sign observables. The
effects are modeled with a crude simulation of a pion gas. Though the
simulation reproduces the scale of the correlation, the centrality dependence
is found to be sufficiently different in character to suggest additional
considerations beyond those present in the pion gas simulation presented here.
