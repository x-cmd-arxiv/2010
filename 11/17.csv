atomic gases. It has, however, been debated whether this type of entanglement
is useful for quantum protocols. This is due to a particle number
superselection rule that restricts the operations that can be performed on the
modes. In this paper, we show how to exploit the mode entanglement of just a
single particle for the teleportation of an unknown quantum state of a spatial
mode. We detail how to overcome the superselection rule to create any initial
quantum state and how to perform Bell state analysis on two of the modes. We
show that two of the four Bell states can always be reliably distinguished,
while the other two have to be grouped together due to an unsatisfied phase
matching condition. The teleportation of an unknown state of a quantum mode
thus only succeeds half of the time.

in outburst again in the 2010 May 27 Chandra observation. We present results
from our four Chandra and seven Swift observations that covered this outburst.
X-ray transient behaviour is generally caused by one of two things: mass
accretion from a high mass companion during some restricted phase range in the
orbital cycle, or disc instability in a low mass system. We aim to exploit
Einstein, HST, Chandra and Swift observations to determine the nature of XMMU
J004215.8+411924. We model the 2010 May spectrum, and use the results to
convert from intensity to counts in the fainter Chandra observations, as well
as the Swift observations; these data are used to create a lightcurve. We also
estimate the flux in the 1979 January 13 Einstein observation. Additionally, we
search for an optical counterpart in HST data. Our best X-ray positions from
the 2006 and 2010 outbursts are 0.3"" apart, and 1.6"" from the Einstein source;
these outbursts are likely to come from the same star system. We see no
evidence for an optical counterpart with m_B < ~25.5; this new limit is 3.5
magnitudes fainter than the existing one. Furthermore, we see no V band
counterpart with m_V < ~26. The local absorption is ~7 times higher than the
Galactic line-of-sight, and provides ~2 magnitudes of extinction in the V band.
Hence M_V > ~ -0.5. Fits to the X-ray emission spectrum suggest a black hole
primary. We find that XMMU J004215.8+411924 is most likely to be a transient
LMXB, rather than a HMXB as originaly proposed. The nature of the primary is
unclear, although we argue that a black hole is likely.

these stars are less than a few arcseconds in angular size. In several cases we
find that the strongest sub-millimeter emission originates from younger,
heavily embedded sources rather than from the HAEBE star, which means that
previous models must be viewed with caution. These new data, in combination
with far-infrared flux measurements available in the literature, yield SEDs
from far-infrared to millimeter wavelengths for all the observed objects.
Isothermal fits to these SEDs demonstrate excellent fits, in most cases, to the
flux densities longward of 100 {\mu}m. We find that a smaller proportion of
B-type stars than A and F-type stars are surrounded by circumstellar disks,
suggesting that disks around B stars dissipate on shorter time scales than
those around later spectral types. Our models also reveal that the mass of the
circumstellar material and the value of beta are correlated, with low masses
corresponding to low values of beta. Since low values of beta imply large grain
sizes, our results suggest that a large fraction of the mass in low-beta
sources is locked up in very large grains. Several of the isolated HAEBE stars
have disks with very flat sub-millimeter SEDs. These disks may be on the verge

security in multiuser wireless networks. The essential premise of
physical-layer security is to enable the exchange of confidential messages over
a wireless medium in the presence of unauthorized eavesdroppers without relying
on higher-layer encryption. This can be achieved primarily in two ways: without
the need for a secret key by intelligently designing transmit coding
strategies, or by exploiting the wireless communication medium to develop
secret keys over public channels. The survey begins with an overview of the
foundations dating back to the pioneering work of Shannon and Wyner on
information-theoretic security. We then describe the evolution of secure
transmission strategies from point-to-point channels to multiple-antenna
systems, followed by generalizations to multiuser broadcast, multiple-access,
interference, and relay networks. Secret-key generation and establishment
protocols based on physical layer mechanisms are subsequently covered.
Approaches for secrecy based on channel coding design are then examined, along
with a description of inter-disciplinary approaches based on game theory and
stochastic geometry. The associated problem of physical-layer message
authentication is also introduced briefly. The survey concludes with
observations on potential research directions in this area.

the outside region $C$ of two black holes $A$ and $B$ whose radii are $R_1$ and
$R_2$ and how it depends on the distance, $r(\gg R_1,R_2)$, between two black
holes. If we can consider the entanglement entropy as thermodynamic entropy, we
can see the entropic force acting on the two black holes from the $r$
dependence of $S_C$. We develop the computational method based on that of
Bombelli et al to obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$ of scalar fields whose
Lagrangian is quadratic with respect to the scalar fields. First we study $S_C$
in $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In this case the state of the
massless free scalar field is the Minkowski vacuum state and we replace two
black holes by two imaginary spheres, and we take the trace over the degrees of
freedom residing in the imaginary spheres. We obtain the leading term of $S_C$
with respect to $1/r$. The result is $S_C=S_A+S_B+\tfrac{1}{r^{2d-2}}
G(R_1,R_2)$, where $S_A$ and $S_B$ are the entanglement entropy on the inside
region of $A$ and $B$, and $G(R_1,R_2) \leq 0$. We do not calculate
$G(R_1,R_2)$ in detail, but we show how to calculate it. In the black hole case
we use the method used in the Minkowski spacetime case with some modifications.
We show that $S_C$ can be expected to be the same form as that in the Minkowski
spacetime case. But in the black hole case, $S_A$ and $S_B$ depend on $r$, so
we do not fully obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$. Finally we assume that the
entanglement entropy can be regarded as thermodynamic entropy, and consider the
entropic force acting on two black holes. We argue how to separate the
entanglement entropic force from other force and how to cancel $S_A$ and $S_B$
whose $r$ dependence are not obtained. Then we obtain the physical prediction
which can be tested experimentally in principle.

Kitaev honeycomb model a linear modification of the Ising interactions due to
the presence of quantized cavity fields. This allows to control the properties
of the low-energy toric code Hamiltonian, which can serve as a quantum memory,
by tuning the physical parameters of the cavity modes, like frequencies, photon
occupations, and coupling strengths. We study the properties of the model
perturbatively by making use of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation and show
that, depending on the specific setup, the cavity modes can be useful in
several ways. They allow to detect the presence of anyons through frequency
shifts and to prolong the lifetime of the memory by enhancing the anyon
excitation energy or mediating long-range anyon-anyon interactions with tunable
sign. We consider both resonant and largely detuned cavity modes.

N=4 SYM theory produces an energy distribution which, in the supergravity
approximation, has the same space-time pattern as the corresponding classical
distribution: the radiation propagates at the speed of light without
broadening. We illustrate this on the basis of several examples: a small
perturbation propagating down a steady string, a massless particle falling into
AdS_5, and the decay of a time-like wave-packet. A similar observation was made
in Phys. Rev. D81 (2010) 126001 for the case of a rotating string. In all these
cases, the absence of broadening is related to the fact that the energy
backreaction on the boundary arises exclusively from the bulk perturbation at,
or near, the boundary. This is so since bulk sources which propagate in AdS_5
at the speed of light do not generate any energy on the boundary. We interpret
these features as an artifact of the supergravity approximation, which fails to
encode quantum mechanical fluctuations that should be present even in the
strong coupling limit. We argue that such fluctuations should enter the dual
string theory as longitudinal string fluctuations, which are not suppressed at
strong coupling. We heuristically estimate the effects of such fluctuations and
argue that they restore the broadening of the radiation, in agreement with
expectations from both quantum mechanics and the ultraviolet/infrared
correspondence.

violations of the superposition principle become manifest. Here we show that
the lower bound on the collapse parameter lambda, coming from the analysis of

electron pairing for superconductivity in iron arsenides; yet their character
is only partially understood. Experimentally, the antiferromagnetic (AF)
transition is always preceded by or coincident with a tetragonal to
orthorhombic structural distortion. Although it has been suggested that this
lattice distortion is driven by an electronic nematic phase, where a
spontaneously generated electronic liquid crystal state breaks the C4
rotational symmetry of the paramagnetic state, experimental evidence for
electronic anisotropy has been either in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase
or the tetragonal phase under uniaxial pressure that breaks this symmetry. Here
we use inelastic neutron scattering to demonstrate the presence of a large
in-plane spin anisotropy above TN in the unstressed tetragonal phase of
BaFe2As2. In the low-temperature orthorhombic phase, we find highly anisotropic
spin waves with a large damping along the AF a-axis direction. On warming the
system to the paramagnetic tetragonal phase, the low-energy spin waves evolve
into quasi-elastic excitations, while the anisotropic spin excitations near the
zone boundary persist. These results strongly suggest that the spin nematicity
we find in the tetragonal phase of BaFe2As2 is the source of the electronic and
orbital anisotropy observed above TN by other probes, and has profound
consequences for the physics of these materials.

the 50-500 keV photons arriving from the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts

their level of polarization. We present here a method by which, despite of the
polarimeter incapability of taking images, GRBs can be roughly localized using
POLAR alone. For this purpose scalers are attached to the output of the 25
multi-anode photomultipliers (MAPMs) that collect the light from the POLAR
scintillator target. Each scaler measures how many GRB photons produce at least
one energy deposition above 50 keV in the corresponding MAPM. Simulations show
that the relative outputs of the 25 scalers depend on the GRB position. A
database of very strong GRBs simulated at 10201 positions has been produced.
When a GRB is detected, its location is calculated searching the minimum of the
chi2 obtained in the comparison between the measured scaler pattern and the
database. This GRB localization technique brings enough accuracy so that the
error transmitted to the 100% modulation factor is kept below 10% for GRBs with
fluence Ftot \geq 10^(-5) erg cm^(-2) . The POLAR localization capability will
be useful for those cases where no other instruments are simultaneously
observing the same field of view.

work to establish the (Voronoi) summation formulae associated with functions
satisfying (modular) transformations of the Jacobi imaginary type by means of a

particular, we construct a family of generalized theta series from Jacobi theta

a jet. We have measured the proper motions of Source I and BN for the first
time at 43 GHz. We confirm that both sources are moving at high speed (12 and
26 km/s, respectively) approximately in opposite directions, as previously
inferred from measurements at lower frequencies. We discuss dynamical scenarios
that can explain the large motions of both BN and Source I and the presence of
disks around both. Our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close
(~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500 years ago between Source I
and BN as proposed by Gomez et al. From the dynamics of encounter we argue that
Source I today is likely to be a binary with a total mass on the order of 20
Msun, and that it probably existed as a softer binary before the close
encounter. This enables preservation of the original accretion disk, though
truncated to its present radius of ~50 AU. N-body numerical simulations show
that the dynamical interaction between a binary of 20 Msun total mass (I) and a
single star of 10 Msun mass (BN) may lead to the ejection of both and binary
hardening. The gravitational energy released in the process would be large
enough to power the wide-angle flow traced by H2 and CO emission in the BN/KL
nebula. Assuming the proposed dynamical history is correct, the smaller mass
for Source I recently estimated from SiO maser dynamics (>7 Msun) by Matthews
et al., suggests that non-gravitational forces (e.g. magnetic) must play an
important role in the circumstellar gas dynamics.

function for the local diffusion of water molecules in tissue. This data is
used to infer structural information in brain imaging. Nonparametric scalar
measures are proposed to summarize such data, and to locally characterize
spatial features of the diffusion probability density function (PDF), relying
on the geometry of the characteristic function. Summary statistics are defined
so that their distributions are, to first-order, both independent of nuisance
parameters and also analytically tractable. The dominant direction of the
diffusion at a spatial location (voxel) is determined, and a new set of axes
are introduced in Fourier space. Variation quantified in these axes determines
the local spatial properties of the diffusion density. Nonparametric hypothesis
tests for determining whether the diffusion is unimodal, isotropic or
multi-modal are proposed. More subtle characteristics of white-matter
microstructure, such as the degree of anisotropy of the PDF and symmetry
compared with a variety of asymmetric PDF alternatives, may be ascertained
directly in the Fourier domain without parametric assumptions on the form of
the diffusion PDF. We simulate a set of diffusion processes and characterize
their local properties using the newly introduced summaries. We show how
complex white-matter structures across multiple voxels exhibit clear
ellipsoidal and asymmetric structure in simulation, and assess the performance
of the statistics in clinically-acquired magnetic resonance imaging data.

generated by the heating of a pre-existing thin stellar disk through a minor
merger (mass ratio 1:10), using N-body/SPH numerical simulations of
interactions that span a range of gas fractions in the primary disk and initial
orbital configurations. The resulting eccentricity distributions have an
approximately triangular shape, with a peak at 0.2-0.35, and a relatively
smooth decline towards higher values. Stars originally in the satellite galaxy
tend to have higher eccentricities (on average from e = 0.45 to e = 0.75),
which is in general agreement with the models of Sales and collaborators,
although in detail we find fewer stars with extreme values and no evidence of
their secondary peak around e = 0.8. The absence of this high-eccentricity
feature results in a distribution that qualitatively matches the observations.
Moreover, the increase in the orbital eccentricities of stars in the solar
neighborhood with vertical distance from the Galactic mid-plane recently found
by Diericxk and collaborators can be qualitatively reproduced by our models,
but only if the satellite is accreted onto a direct orbit. We thus speculate
that if minor mergers were the dominant means of formating the Milky Way thick
disk, the primary mechanism should be merging with satellite(s) on direct
orbits.

Doppler-velocity signals. We select the wave sources at different locations
relative to the sunspot, and investigate the p- and f-mode waves separately.
The results reveal a complicated picture of waveform perturbations caused by
the wave interaction with the sunspot. In particular, it is found that for
waves originating from outside of the sunspot, p-mode waves travel across the
sunspot with a small amplitude reduction and slightly higher speed, and wave
amplitude and phase get mostly restored to the quiet-Sun values after passing
the sunspot. The f-mode wave experiences some amplitude reduction passing
through the sunspot, and the reduced amplitude is not recovered after that. The
wave-propagation speed does not change before encountering the sunspot and
inside the sunspot, but the wavefront becomes faster than the reference wave
after passing through the sunspot. For waves originating from inside the
sunspot umbra, both f- and p-mode waves show significant amplitude reductions
and faster speed during all courses of propagation. A comparison of positive
and negative time lags of cross-correlation functions shows an apparent
asymmetry in the waveform changes for both the f- and p-mode waves. We suggest
that the waveform variations of the helioseismic waves interacting with a

heliotomography, similar to the waveform tomography of the Earth.

{[(R,B,B) / (R,R,B)] ; [(R,B,N) / (N,R,B)] ; [(N,B,N) / (N,R,N)] ; [R,N,B] ;
[(R,N,N) / (N,N,B)] ; [N,N,N]}. In this paper we investigate these
sister-puzzles, identify the algorithm that optimally solves each pre-colored
puzzle, and prove its Optimality. As it turns out, five of the six algorithms,
challenging on their own, are part of the algorithm solving the ""natural"", Free
Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle [N,N,N]. We start by showing that the N-disk
Colored Tower [(R,B,B) / (R,R,B)] is solved by (3^N - 1)/2 moves. Defining
""Algorithm Duration"" as the ratio of number of algorithm-moves solving the
puzzle to the number of algorithm-moves solving the Colored Tower, we find the
Duration-Limits for all sister-puzzles. In the order of the list above they are
{[1] ; [10/11] ; [10/11] ; [8/11] ; [7/11] ; [20/33]}. Thus, the Duration-Limit
of the Optimal Algorithm solving the Free Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is
20/33 or 606 0/00. On the road to optimally solve this colorful Magnetic
puzzle, we hit other ""forward-moving"" puzzle-solving algorithms. Overall we
looked at 10 pairs of integer sequences. Of the twenty integer sequences, five
are listed in the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, the other fifteen
- not yet. The large set of different solutions is a clear indication to the
freedom-of-wondering that makes this Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle so
colorful.

This, however, contrasts with the mechanism proposed by S. Kauffman in which
each of the logic functions must be carefully constructed to accurately take
into account the combinatorial nature of gene regulation. While Kauffman
Boolean networks have been extensively studied and proved to have the necessary
properties required for modeling the fundamental characteristics of genetic
regulatory networks, not much is known about the essential properties of
threshold networks. Here we study the dynamical properties of these networks
with different connectivities, activator-repressor proportions,
activator-repressor strengths and different thresholds. Special attention is
paid to the way in which the threshold value affects the dynamical regime in
which the network operates and the structure of the attractor landscape. We
find that only for a very restricted set of parameters, these networks show
dynamical properties consistent with what is observed in biological systems.
The virtues of these properties and the possible problems related with the
restrictions are discussed and related to earlier work that uses these kind of

qubit energy level spacing, the normalized decay rate of the qubit is lower
than 1, which manifests the QZE. However, when the cavity frequency is detuned
from resonance, the normalized decay rate becomes larger than 1, which
corresponds to the AZE. The change from the QZE to the AZE, by just varying the
central frequency of the cavity mode, should allow to distinguish these two
different effects. Moreover, we find that in the presence of both qubit's
intrinsic bath and the cavity bath, the emergence of the QZE and the AZE
behaviors relies not only on the match between the qubit energy level spacing
and the central frequency of the cavity mode, but also on the coupling strength

cover forecast varies from ~50% to ~85%. The probability of cloud detection is
estimated to be around ~30% to ~90%, while the false alarm rate is generally
moderate and is much lower than the probability of detection in most cases. The
seeing forecast has a moderate mean difference (absolute mean difference <0.3""

effect of turbulence near ground and on sub-kilometer scale. In all, although

rodlike and slablike shapes, which are often called nuclear pasta. We study the
equilibrium properties of the nuclear pasta by using a liquid drop model with
curvature corrections. It is confirmed that the curvature effect acts to lower
the transition densities between different shapes. We also examine the gyroid
structure, which was recently suggested as a different type of nuclear pasta by
analogy with the polymer systems. The gyroid structure investigated in this
paper is approximately formulated as an extension of the periodic minimal
surface whose mean curvature vanishes. In contrast to our expectations, we find
from the present approximate formulation that the curvature corrections act to
slightly disfavor the appearance of the gyroid structure. By comparing the
energy corrections in the gyroid phase and the hypothetical phases composed of
d-dimensional spheres, where d is a general dimensionality, we show that the
gyroid is unlikely to belong to a family of the generalized dimensional
spheres.

In the
standard approach to cosmology it is assumed that this relation is the same as
in the homogeneous universe. As the real universe is not homogeneous there are
several methods to calculate the correction. The weak lensing approximation and
the Dyer-Roeder relation are one of them. This paper establishes a link between
these two approximations. It is shown that if the universe is homogeneous with
only small, vanishing after averaging, density fluctuations along the line of
sight, then the distance correction is negligible. It is also shown that a
vanishing 3D average of density fluctuations does not imply that the mean of
density fluctuations along the line of sight is zero. In this case, even within
the linear approximation, the distance correction is not negligible. The
modified version of the Dyer-Roeder relation is presented and it is shown that
this modified relation is consistent with the correction obtained within the
weak lensing approximation. The correction to the distance for a source at z ~
2 is of order of a few percent. Thus, with an increasing precision of
cosmological observations an accurate estimation of the distance is essential.
Otherwise errors due to miscalculation the distance can become a major source
of systematics.

and man-made systems of coupled oscillators. It is well-known that there exists
a critical coupling strength among the oscillators at which a phase transition
from incoherency to synchronization occurs. This paper features four
contributions. First, we characterize and distinguish the different notions of
synchronization used throughout the literature and formally introduce the
concept of phase cohesiveness as an analysis tool and performance index for
synchronization. Second, we review the vast literature providing necessary,
sufficient, implicit, and explicit estimates of the critical coupling strength
for finite and infinite-dimensional, and for first and second-order Kuramoto
models. Third, we present the first explicit necessary and sufficient condition
on the critical coupling to achieve synchronization in the finite-dimensional
Kuramoto model for an arbitrary distribution of the natural frequencies. The
multiplicative gap in the synchronization condition yields a practical
stability result determining the admissible initial and the guaranteed ultimate
phase cohesiveness as well as the guaranteed asymptotic magnitude of the order
parameter. Fourth and finally, we extend our analysis to multi-rate Kuramoto
models consisting of second-order Kuramoto oscillators with inertia and viscous
damping together with first-order Kuramoto oscillators with multiple time
constants. We prove that the multi-rate Kuramoto model is locally topologically
conjugate to a first-order Kuramoto model with scaled natural frequencies, and
we present necessary and sufficient conditions for almost global phase
synchronization and local frequency synchronization. Interestingly, these
conditions do not depend on the inertiae which contradicts prior observations
on the role of inertiae in synchronization of second-order Kuramoto models.

watchdog. By enabling nodes to detect malicious behaviors probabilistically and
use overheard messages to police their downstream neighbors locally, the
algebraic watchdog delivers a secure global self-checking network. Unlike
traditional Byzantine detection protocols which are receiver-based, this
protocol gives the senders an active role in checking the node downstream. The
key idea is inspired by Marti et al.'s watchdog-pathrater, which attempts to
detect and mitigate the effects of routing misbehavior.
  As an initial building block of a such system, we first focus on a two-hop
network. We present a graphical model to understand the inference process nodes
execute to police their downstream neighbors; as well as to compute, analyze,
and approximate the probabilities of misdetection and false detection. In
addition, we present an algebraic analysis of the performance using an
hypothesis testing framework that provides exact formulae for probabilities of
false detection and misdetection.
  We then extend the algebraic watchdog to a more general network setting, and
propose a protocol in which we can establish trust in coded systems in a
distributed manner. We develop a graphical model to detect the presence of an
adversarial node downstream within a general multi-hop network. The structure
of the graphical model (a trellis) lends itself to well-known algorithms, such
as the Viterbi algorithm, which can compute the probabilities of misdetection
and false detection. We show analytically that as long as the min-cut is not
dominated by the Byzantine adversaries, upstream nodes can monitor downstream
neighbors and allow reliable communication with certain probability. Finally,
we present simulation results that support our analysis.

dual DSR. First, we show that the dual kappa Poincare algebra is isomorphic to
de Sitter algebra and its spactime is essentially de Sitter spacetime. Second,
we show how to derive the coproduct rules for Beltrami and conformal
coordinates of de Sitter spacetime. It follows from the current literature on
de Sitter relativity that the speed of light c and the de Sitter length are the
two invariant scales of the physics of dual kappa Poincare algebra. Third, we
derive the Casimir invariant of the dual kappa Popincare algebra and use this
to derive an expression for the speed of light, our fourth result. Fifth, the
field equation for the scalar field is derived from the Casimir invariant. The
results for the coordinate speed of light and the scalar field theory are the
same as in de Sitter theory in the planar coordinate basis. Thus, we have shown
that the physics of dual kappa Poincare algebra (in the dual bicrossproduct
basis), which can be apprpriately called dual DSR, is essentially de Sitter
relativity. Sixth, we argue the existence of an observer-independent minimum
momentum. Seventh, we argue heuristically that the existence of minimum
momentum will lead to a dual generalized uncertainty principle. Finally, we
note that dual DSR is not a quantum theory of spacetime but a quantum theory of
momenta.

Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) observations
toward the nearby grand-design spiral galaxy M 51. The angular resolution of
0.7"" corresponds to 30 pc, which is similar to the typical size of Giant
Molecular Clouds (GMCs), and the sensitivity is also high enough to detect
typical GMCs. Within the 1' field of view centered on a spiral arm, a number of
GMC-scale structures are detected as clumps. However, only a few clumps are
found to be associated with each Giant Molecular Association (GMA), and more
than 90% of the total flux is resolved out in our data. Considering the high
sensitivity and resolution of our data, these results indicate that GMAs are
not mere confusion of GMCs but plausibly smooth structures. In addition, we
have found that the most massive clumps are located downstream of the spiral
arm, which suggests that they are at a later stage of molecular cloud evolution
across the arm and plausibly are cores of GMAs. By comparing with H-alpha and
Pa-alpha images, most of these cores are found to have nearby star forming
regions. We thus propose an evolutionary scenario for the interstellar medium,
in which smaller molecular clouds collide to form smooth GMAs at spiral arm
regions and then star formation is triggered in the GMA cores. Our new CO data
have revealed the internal structure of GMAs at GMC scales, finding the most
massive substructures on the downstream side of the arm in close association
with the brightest H II regions.

a deviation at a significance level larger than 2$\sigma$ from the sequence for
three typical optically ""dark"" bursts. The deviation favors a heavy extinction

space-time environments are known to have diffusive scaling limits. In the
continuum limit, the random environment is represented by a `stochastic flow of
kernels', which is a collection of random kernels that can be loosely
interpreted as the transition probabilities of a Markov process in a random
environment. The theory of stochastic flows of kernels was introduced by Le Jan
and Raimond, who showed that each such flow is characterized by its n-point
motions. We focus on a class of stochastic flows of kernels with Brownian
n-point motions which, after their inventors, will be called Howitt-Warren
flows. We give a graphical construction of general Howitt-Warren flows, where
the underlying random environment takes on the form of a suitably marked
Brownian web. Alternatively, we show that a special subclass of the
Howitt-Warren flows can be constructed as random flows of mass in a Brownian
net. Using these constructions, we prove some new results for the Howitt-Warren
flows. In particular, we show that the kernels spread with a finite speed and
have a locally finite support at deterministic times if and only if the flow is
embeddable in a Brownian net. We show that the kernels are always purely atomic
at deterministic times, but with the exception of a special subclass known as
the erosion flows, exhibit random times when the kernels are purely non-atomic.
We moreover prove ergodic statements for a class of measure-valued processes
induced by the Howitt-Warren flows. Along the way, we also prove some new
results for the Brownian web and net.

the approach of reference [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 88} (2002) 161301], and can be
summarized in the following steps: i) the Hamiltonian is derived from the
Einstein-Hilbert action (plus a self-interacting scalar field action) for a
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime with flat spatial sections, ii) canonical
quantization recipe is applied, i. e., the minisuperspace variables are
promoted to operators, and the WDW equation is written in terms of these
variables, iii) noncommutativity in the minisuperspace is achieved through the
replacement of the standard product of functions by the Moyal star product in
the WDW equation, and, finally, iv) semi-classical cosmological equations are
obtained by means of the WKB approximation applied to the (equivalent) modified
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We demonstrate, indeed, that noncommutative effects
of the kind considered here, can be those responsible for the present speed up

straightforward extension is to use such kind of monochromator setup with two
-or more- crystals arranged in a series to spectrally filter the SASE radiation
at two closely-spaced wavelengths within the FEL gain band. This allows for the
production of doublet -or multiplet- spectral lines. Applications involve any
process with a large change in cross section over a narrow wavelength range, as
in multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction. Here we consider the simultaneous
operation of the LCLS hard X-ray FEL at two closely spaced wavelengths. We
present simulation results for the LCLS baseline, yielding fully coherent
radiation shared between two longitudinal modes. Mode spacing can be easily
tuned within the FEL gain band. The XFEL output intensity contains an
oscillating ""mode-beat"" component whose frequency is related to the frequency
difference between the pair of longitudinal modes considered. At saturation one
obtains FEL-induced modulations of energy loss and energy spread in the
electron bunch at optical frequency, which can be converted into density
modulation at the same optical frequency using a weak chicane installed behind
the baseline undulator. Powerful coherent radiation can then be generated with
the help of an optical transition radiation (OTR) station. We also consider how
the doublet structure of the XFEL generation spectra can be monitored by an
optical spectrometer. The OTR coherent radiation pulse is naturally
synchronized with the X-ray pulses, and can be used for timing the XFEL to high

be immune against contagious diseases, we can save resources and life. A key to
reach such a lower threshold of immunization is to find and vaccinate people
who, through their behavior, are more likely to become infected and effective
to spread the disease than the average. Fortunately, the very behavior that
makes these people important to vaccinate can help us finding them. People you
have met recently are more likely to be socially active and thus central in the
contact pattern, and important to vaccinate. We propose two immunization
schemes exploiting temporal contact patterns. Both of these rely only on
obtainable, local information and could implemented in practice. We show that
these schemes outperform benchmark protocols in four real data sets under
various epidemic scenarios. The data sets are dynamic, which enables us to make
more realistic evaluations than other studies - we use information only about
the past to perform the vaccination and the future to simulate disease
outbreaks. We also use models to elucidate the mechanisms behind how the
temporal structures make our immunization protocols efficient.

all most commonly used packages carry out the source detection over the signal
image, our proposed method builds from the measured image a ""curvature"" image
by double-differentiation in four different directions. In this way point-like
as well as resolved, yet relatively compact, objects are easily revealed while
the slower varying fore/background is greatly diminished. Candidate sources are
then identified by looking for pixels where the curvature exceeds, in absolute
terms, a given threshold; the methodology easily allows us to pinpoint
breakpoints in the source brightness profile and then derive reliable guesses
for the sources extent. Identified peaks are fit with 2D elliptical Gaussians
plus an underlying planar inclined plateau, with mild constraints on size and
orientation. Mutually contaminating sources are fit with multiple Gaussians
simultaneously using flexible constraints. We ran our method on simulated
large-scale fields with 1000 sources of different peak flux overlaid on a
realistic realization of diffuse background. We find detection rates in excess
of 90% for sources with peak fluxes above the 3-sigma signal noise limit; for
about 80% of the sources the recovered peak fluxes are within 30% of their
input values.

asymptotic-giant-branch stars of Population I experiencing extended mixing. We
adopt the updated version of the FRANEC evolutionary model, a new post-process
code for non-convective mixing and the most recent revisions for solar
abundances. In this framework, we discuss the effects of recent improvements in
relevant reaction rates for proton captures on intermediate-mass nuclei (from
carbon to aluminum). For each nucleus we briefly discuss the new choices and
their motivations. The calculations are then performed on the basis of a
parameterized circulation, where the effects of the new nuclear inputs are best
compared to previous works. We find that the new rates (and notably the one for
the 14N(p,g)15O reaction) imply considerable modifications in the composition
of post-main sequence stars. In particular, the slight temperature changes due
to the reduced efficiency of proton captures on 14N induce abundance variations
at the first dredge up (especially for 17O, whose equilibrium ratio to 16O is
very sensitive to the temperature). In this new scenario presolar oxide grains
of AGB origin turn out to be produced almost exclusively by very-low mass stars
(M<=1.5-1.7Msun), never becoming C-rich. The whole population of grains with
18O/16O below 0.0015 (the limit permitted by first dredge up) is now explained.
Also, there is now no forbidden area for very low values of 17O/16O (below
0.0005), contrary to previous findings. A rather shallow type of transport
seems to be sufficient for the CNO changes in RGB stages. Both thermohaline
diffusion and magnetic-buoyancy-induced mixing might provide a suitable
physical mechanism for this. Thermohaline mixing is in any case certainly
inadequate to account for the production of 26Al on the AGB. Other transport
mechanisms must therefore be at play.

GeO2, which is derived from cristobalite and is different from rutile,
dramatically reduces the lattice mismatch at the interface and is much more
stable than the conventional fourfold interface. Since the grain boundary
between fourfold and sixfold GeO2 is unstable, the sixfold GeO2 forms a large
grain at the interface. On the contrary, a comparative study with SiO2
demonstrates that SiO2 maintains a fourfold structure. The sixfold GeO2/Ge

model, there is a need to consider other well motivated theories of halo
formation. In this paper, we study a different halo model, that of self similar
infall which is characterized by the presence of a number of cold streams and
caustics, not seen in simulations. It is shown that the self similar infall
model is consistent with the DAMA result both in amplitude and in phase, for
WIMP masses exceeding $\approx$ 250 GeV at the 99.7% confidence level. Adding a
small thermal component makes the parameter space near $m_\chi$ = 12 GeV
consistent with the self similar model. The minimum $\chi^2$ per degree of
freedom is found to be 0.92(1.03) with(without) channeling taken into account,
indicating an acceptable fit. For WIMP masses much greater than the mass of the
target nucleus, the recoil rate depends only on the ratio $\sigma_{\rm

case of the isothermal halo, the allowed parameter space is inconsistent with
the null result obtained by the CDMS and Xenon experiments for spin-independent

amplitude of the periodic component in the binary's $B$ brightness variations
is within $0.265^{m}{-}0.278^{m}$ ($0.290^{m}{-}0.320^{m}$ in $W$); this is due
to the ellipsoidal shape of the optical component, which is distorted with
gravitational forces from the X-ray component. Some of the system's active
states (long flares) may be due to instabilities in the accretion disk, and
possibly to instabilities of gas flows and other accretion structures. The
binary possesses a low-luminosity accretion disk. The light curves reveal no

that the optical star in the close binary V1341 $\textrm{Cyg} = \textrm{Cyg}$

Although their existence have been confirmed by statistical studies of large

groups, is not an easy task, list of members often change with time and most
members have been identified by means of kinematics criteria which is not
sufficient since many old stars can share the same spatial motion of those
