potential. Once the rotational symmetry is broken, we find that the vortex
system undergoes a rich variety of structural changes, including the formation
of zig-zag and linear configurations. These spatial re-arrangements are well
signaled by the change in the behavior of the vortex-pattern eigenmodes against
the anisotropy parameter. The existence of such structural changes opens up
possibilities for the coherent exploitation of effective many-body systems
based on vortex patterns.

short distances taking into account generic effects of quantum gravity.
Inflation amplifies tiny quantum fluctuations in the early universe to
macroscopic scales and may thus imprint high energy physics signatures in the
cosmological perturbations that could be detected in the CMB. It is shown here
that this can give rise to parity-violating modulations of the primordial
spectrum and odd non-Gaussian signatures. The breaking of rotational invariance
of the CMB provides constraints on the scale of noncommutativity that are
competitive with the existing noncosmological bounds, and could explain the
curious hemispherical asymmetry that has been claimed to be observed in the
sky. This introduces also non-Gaussianity with peculiar shape- and
scale-dependence, which in principle allows an independent cross-check of the
presence of noncommutativity at inflation.

relative variation of the radial velocity due to the star activity cannot be

main technique used here is a self-consistent version of the high-pass filter
used by Queloz et al. (2009) in the first mass determination of CoRoT-7b and
CoRoT-7c. The results are compared to those given by two alternative
techniques: (1) The approach proposed by Hatzes et al. (2010) using only those
nights in which 2 or 3 observations were done; (2) A pure Fourier analysis. In
all cases, the eccentricities are taken equal to zero as indicated by the study
of the tidal evolution of the system; the periods are also kept fixed at the
values given by Queloz et al. Only the observations done in the time interval
BJD 2,454,847 - 873 are used because they include many nights with multiple
observations; otherwise it is not possible to separate the effects of the
rotation fourth harmonic (5.91d = Prot/4) from the alias of the orbital period
of CoRoT-7b (0.853585 d). The results of the various approaches are combined to
give for the planet masses the values 8.0 \pm 1.2 MEarth for CoRoT-7b and 13.6
\pm 1.4 MEarth for CoRoT 7c. An estimation of the variation of the radial
velocity of the star due to its activity is also given.The results obtained
with 3 different approaches agree to give masses larger than those in previous
determinations. From the existing internal structure models they indicate that
CoRoT-7b is a much denser super-Earth. The bulk density is 11 \pm 3.5 g.cm-3 .
CoRoT-7b may be rocky with a large iron core.

atoms or electronic transport phenomena. On the other hand, entanglement
concepts have proven to be extremely useful to investigate quantum phases of
matter. Here, it is argued that **bipartite** entanglement measures provide key
information on out-of-equilibrium states and might therefore offer stringent
thermalization criteria. This is illustrated by considering a global quench in
an (extended) XXZ spin-1/2 chain across its (zero-temperature) quantum critical
point. A non-local **bipartition** of the chain **preserving translation
symmetry** is proposed. The time-evolution after the quench of the **reduced**
density matrix of the half-system is computed and its associated
(time-dependent) entanglement spectrum is analyzed. Generically, the
corresponding entanglement entropy quickly reaches a ""plateau"" after a short
transient regime. However, in the case of the integrable XXZ chain, the
low-energy entanglement spectrum still reveals strong time-fluctuations. In
addition, its infinite-time average shows strong deviations from the spectrum
of a Boltzmann thermal density matrix. In contrast, when the integrability of
the model is broken (by small next-nearest neighbor couplings), the
entanglement spectra of the time-average and thermal density matrices become
remarkably similar.

coping with the issue of locality. Inspired by sequential complexity theory, we
focus on a complexity theory for distributed decision problems. In the context
of locality, solving a decision problem requires the processors to
independently inspect their local neighborhoods and then collectively decide
whether a given global input instance belongs to some specified language. This
paper introduces several classes of distributed decision problems, proves
separation among them and presents some complete problems. More specifically,
we consider the standard LOCAL model of computation and define LD (for local
decision) as the class of decision problems that can be solved in constant
number of communication rounds. We first study the intriguing question of
whether randomization helps in local distributed computing, and to what extent.
Specifically, we define the corresponding randomized class BPLD, and ask
whether LD=BPLD. We provide a partial answer to this question by showing that
in many cases, randomization does not help for deciding hereditary languages.
In addition, we define the notion of local many-one reductions, and introduce
the (nondeterministic) class NLD of decision problems for which there exists a
certificate that can be verified in constant number of communication rounds. We
prove that there exists an NLD-complete problem. We also show that there exist
problems not in NLD. On the other hand, we prove that the class NLD#n, which is
NLD assuming that each processor can access an oracle that provides the number
of nodes in the network, contains all (decidable) languages. For this class we
provide a natural complete problem as well.

distribution of the latent state trajectory, given observations, or
expectations of functionals of the state trajectory with respect to this
distributions. For models that are not linear Gaussian or possess finite state
space, smoothing distributions are in general infeasible to compute as they
involve intergrals over a space of dimensionality at least equal to the number
of observations. Recent years have seen an increased interest in Monte
Carlo-based methods for smoothing, often involving particle filters. One such
method is to approximate filter distributions with a particle filter, and then
to simulate backwards on the trellis of particles using a backward kernel. We
show that by supplementing this procedure with a Metropolis-Hastings step
deciding whether to accept a proposed trajectory or not, one obtains a Markov
chain Monte Carlo scheme whose stationary distribution is the exact smoothing
distribution. We also show that in this procedure, backward sampling can be
replaced by backward smoothing, which effectively means averaging over all
possible trajectories. In an example we compare these approaches to a similar
one recently proposed by Andrieu, Doucet and Holenstein, and show that the new
methods can be more efficient in terms of precision (inverse variance) per
computation time.

examined consequently to improve either the number of CNOT gates or the total

and Dabholkar for the N=1,2,3 orbifoldings to the N=4,5 and 6 models, all of
which have an infinite number of walls in the fundamental domain. We find that
analogous to the Stern-Brocot tree, which generated the intercepts of the walls
on the real line, the intercepts for the N >3 cases are generated by linear
recurrence relations. Using the correspondence between the walls of marginal
stability and the walls of the Weyl chamber of the corresponding BKM Lie
superalgebra, we propose the Cartan matrices for the BKM Lie superalgebras
corresponding to the N=5 and 6 models.

classification of the Weyl tensor and the Ricci tensor in higher dimensions can
then be refined utilizing their eigenbivector and eigenvalue structure,
respectively. In particular, for a tensor of a particular algebraic type, the
associated operator will have a restricted eigenvector structure, and this can
then be used to determine necessary conditions for a particular algebraic type.
We shall present an analysis of the discriminants of the associated
characteristic equation for the eigenvalues of an operator to determine the
conditions on (the associated) curvature tensor for a given algebraic type. We
will describe an algorithm which enables us to completely determine the
eigenvalue structure of the curvature operator, up to degeneracies, in terms of
a set of discriminants. We then express these conditions (discriminants) in
terms of these polynomial curvature invariants. In particular, we can use the
techniques described to study the necessary conditions in arbitrary dimensions
for the Weyl and Ricci curvature operators (and hence the higher dimensional
Weyl and Ricci tensors) to be of algebraic type II or D, and create syzygies
which are necessary for the special algebraic type to be fulfilled. We are
consequently able to determine the necessary conditions in terms of simple
scalar polynomial curvature invariants in order for the higher dimensional Weyl

the low-temperature phase from a partially ferromagnetic and metallic to one
that is less ferromagnetic and highly resistive for the composition close to
charge ordering (x=050 and 0.52). Irrespective of the actual ground state of
the compound, the effect of thermal cycling is towards an increase of the
amount of the insulating phase. We have observed the magnetic relaxation in the
metastable state and also the revival of the metastable state (in a relaxed
sample) due to high temperature thermal treatment. We observed changes in the
resistivity and magnetization as the revived metastable state is cycled. The
time changes in the magnetization are logarithmic in general and activation
energies are consistent with those expected for electron transfer between Mn
ions. Changes induced by thermal cycling can be inhibited by applying magnetic
field. These results suggest that oxygen non-stoichiometry results in
mechanical strains in this two-phase system, leading to the development of
frustrated metastable states which relax towards the more stable charge-ordered

accommodation, producing the observed irreversibility.

However, recent work in the ultraviolet (UV) with GALEX has shown that star
formation rates (SFRs) inferred from H-alpha in galactic environments
characterized by low stellar and gas densities tend to be less than those based
on the UV luminosity. The origin of the discrepancy is actively debated because
one possible explanation is that the stellar initial mass function is
systematically deficient in high mass stars in such environments. In this
contribution, we summarize our work on this topic using a dwarf galaxy
dominated sample of ~300 late-type galaxies in the 11 Mpc Local Volume. The
sample allows us to examine the discrepancy between H-alpha and UV SFRs using a
statistical number of galaxies with activities less than 0.1 Msun/yr. A range
of potential causes for such an effect are reviewed. We find that while the IMF
hypothesis is not inconsistent with our observations, alternate explanations
remain that must be investigated further before a final conclusion can be

average flow time, Shortest-Remaining-Processing-Time (\srpt) appears to be the
most natural algorithm to consider for the problem of minimizing average flow
time on multiple identical machines. It is known that $\srpt$ achieves the best
possible competitive ratio on multiple machines up to a constant factor. Using
resource augmentation, $\srpt$ is known to achieve total flow time at most that
of the optimal solution when given machines of speed $2- \frac{1}{m}$. Further,
it is known that $\srpt$'s competitive ratio improves as the speed increases;
$\srpt$ is $s$-speed $\frac{1}{s}$-competitive when $s \geq 2- \frac{1}{m}$.
  However, a gap has persisted in our understanding of $\srpt$. Before this
work, the performance of $\srpt$ was not known when $\srpt$ is given
$(1+\eps)$-speed when $0 < \eps < 1-\frac{1}{m}$, even though it has been
thought that $\srpt$ is $(1+\eps)$-speed $O(1)$-competitive for over a decade.
Resolving this question was suggested in Open Problem 2.9 from the survey
""Online Scheduling"" by Pruhs, Sgall, and Torng \cite{PruhsST}, and we answer
the question in this paper. We show that $\srpt$ is \emph{scalable} on $m$
identical machines. That is, we show $\srpt$ is $(1+\eps)$-speed
$O(\frac{1}{\eps})$-competitive for $\eps >0$. We complement this by showing
that $\srpt$ is $(1+\eps)$-speed $O(\frac{1}{\eps^2})$-competitive for the
objective of minimizing the $\ell_k$-norms of flow time on $m$ identical
machines. Both of our results rely on new potential functions that capture the
structure of \srpt. Our results, combined with previous work, show that $\srpt$

condition holds, the theorem reduces to verifying conditions on the underived

performs comparably to the PTF scanners, and identified as transients 93% of
the ~130 spectroscopically confirmed SNe that PTF located during the trial

only a small fraction of the lowest signal-to-noise SN detections (r > 19.5)

fundamental importance for understanding galaxies. So far this stellar initial
mass function has been assumed to be identical to the IMF observed directly in

than uniformly distributed over the whole galaxy, the galaxy-wide IMF needs to
be calculated by adding all IMFs of all embedded groups. This integrated
galactic stellar initial mass function (IGIMF) is steeper than the canonical
IMF and steepens with decreasing SFR, leading to fundamental new insights and

close companions, they offer a useful template for our expectations of more
typical planets. We present the results from an adaptive optics imaging survey

aspects of it remain poorly constrained. In particular, the evolution of

derived for circular binaries does not apply. Here, we report the results of
our Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of mass transfer in eccentric
binaries using an alternate method in which we model only the outermost layers
of the stars with appropriate boundary conditions. Using this technique, along
with properly relaxed model stars, we characterize the mass transfer episodes
of binaries with various orbital parameters. In particular, we show that these
episodes can be described by Gaussians with a FWMH of ~0.12 P_orb and that the
peak rates occur after periastron, at an orbital phase of ~0.58, independently
of the eccentricity and mass of the stars. The accreted material is observed to
form a rather sparse envelope around either or both stars. Although the fate of
this envelope is not modeled in our simulations, we show that a constant
fraction (~5%) of the material transferred is ejected from the systems. We
discuss this result in terms of the non-conservative mass transfer scenario. We
suggest our results could be incorporated in analytical and binary population

be consistent with present bounds on EWPT for m > 1 TeV at 95% CL. The model

equilibrium is rarely optimal for the manifestation of a given quantum

non-equilibrium spatial correlation function with periodic driving. We show
that the non-equilibrium phase boundary between coherent and incoherent states
at finite bath temperatures can be made qualitatively identical to the familiar
zero-temperature phase diagram, and we discuss the experimental manifestation
of this phenomenon in cold atoms.

equivalent width (EW) of the Ni Kalpha fluorescent emission line in the

In the Compton-thin regime, the EW of the Ni Kalpha line is a factor of ~22
less than that of the Fe Kalpha line but this factor can be as low as ~6 in the
Compton-thick regime. We show that the optically-thin limit for this ratio
depends only on the Fe to Ni abundance ratio, it being independent of the
geometry and covering factor of the reprocessor, and also independent of the
shape of the incident X-ray continuum. We give some useful analytic expressions
for the absolute flux and the EW of the Ni Kalpha line in the optically-thin
limit. When the reprocessor is Compton-thick and the incident continuum is a
power-law with a photon index of 1.9, the Ni Kalpha line EW has a maximum value
of ~3 eV and ~250 eV for non-intercepting and intercepting lines-of-sight
respectively. Larger EWs are obtained for flatter continua. We have also
studied the Compton shoulder of the Ni Ka line and find that the ratio of
scattered to unscattered flux in the line has a maximum value of 0.26, less
than the corresponding maximum for the Fe Kalpha line. However, we find that
the shape of the Compton shoulder profile for a given column density and
inclination angle of the torus is similar to the corresponding profile for the
Fe Ka line. Our results will be useful for interpreting X-ray spectra of active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) and X-ray binary systems in which the system parameters
are favorable for the Ni Kalpha line to be detected.

formation of many different exotic stellar populations, but detailed modeling
of mass transfer is a computationally challenging problem. Here, we present an
alternate Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics approach to the modeling of mass
transfer in binary systems that allows a better resolution of the flow of
matter between main-sequence stars. Our approach consists of modeling only the
outermost layers of the stars using appropriate boundary conditions and ghost
particles. We arbitrarily set the radius of the boundary and find that our
boundary treatment behaves physically and conserves energy well. In particular,
when used with our binary relaxation procedure, our treatment of boundary
conditions is also shown to evolve circular binaries properly for many orbits.
The results of our first simulation of mass transfer are also discussed and
used to assess the strengths and limitations of our method. We conclude that it
is well suited for the modeling of interacting binary stars. The method
presented here represents a convenient alternative to previous hydrodynamical
techniques aimed at modeling mass transfer in binary systems since it can be
used to model both the donor and the accretor while maintaining the density
profiles taken from realistic stellar models.

stellar sources, we decompose the unknown function N_{ion}(z), representing the
number of photons in the IGM per baryon in collapsed objects, into its
principal components and constrain the latter using the photoionization rate
obtained from Ly-alpha forest Gunn-Peterson optical depth, the WMAP7 electron
scattering optical depth and the redshift distribution of Lyman-limit systems

model N_{ion}(z) over the redshift range 2<z<14 using 5 parameters to extract
the maximum information contained within the data. (ii) All quantities related
to reionization can be severely constrained for z<6 because of a large number
of data points whereas constraints at z>6 are relatively loose. (iii) The weak
constraints on N_{ion}(z) at z>6 do not allow to disentangle different feedback
models with present data. There is a clear indication that N_{ion}(z) must
increase at z>6, thus ruling out reionization by a single stellar population
with non-evolving IMF, and/or star-forming efficiency, and/or photon escape
fraction. The data allows for non-monotonic N_{ion}(z) which may contain sharp
features around z \sim 7. (iv) The PCA implies that reionization must be 99%
completed between 5.8<z<10.3 (95% confidence level) and is expected to be 50%
complete at z \approx 9.5-12. With future data sets, like those obtained by

a nearby low-mass star, Upsilon And B, which could perturb the planetary
orbits, but we find it cannot modify two coplanar orbits into the observed
mutual inclination of ~30 deg. However, it could incite ejections or collisions
between planetary companions that subsequently raise the mutual inclination to

further from the stability boundary than Upsilon And, but we are able to

determined by the kurtosis $\beta_2$ of the distribution function at

for $\beta_2 > 1$ that contributes to free streaming and leads to further
suppression of the matter power spectrum and an enhancement of the peculiar
velocity autocorrelation function at scales smaller than the free streaming
scale. Statistical fluctuations of peculiar velocities are also suppressed on
these scales by the same effect. In the linearized approximation, the coarse

gravitational perturbations determined by the power spectrum of density

emergent, entropic force might have nontrivial implications to cosmology. Here
two approaches are investigated: in one, the Friedman equation receives
entropic contributions from the usually neglected surface terms, and in
another, the extra terms are derived from quantum corrections to the entropy
formula. UV terms may drive inflation, avoiding a recently derived no-go
theorem, though in some cases leading to a graceful exit problem. IR terms can
generate dark energy, alleviating the cosmological constant problem. The
quantum corrections are bounded by their implications to the BBN, and the
surface terms are constrained in addition by their effect upon the behavior of
matter. Likelihood analyses are performed to constrain the modifications by the
SNeIa, BAO and CMB data. It is found that a monomial correction to the
area-entropy formula results in late acceleration in very good agreement with
observations, which then turn out to be compatible with positive curvature. The
evolution of perturbations is deduced by assuming the Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem.
Distinct signatures can then be identified in the large scale structure
formation. Furthermore, it is shown that the visible universe satisfies the

devices that steer electromagnetic, acoustic and quantum waves around a region
without penetrating it, so that this region is hidden from external
observations. The material pa- rameters used to describe these devices are
anisotropic, and singular at the interface between the cloaked and uncloaked
regions, making physical realization a challenge. These singular material
parameters correspond to singular coefficient functions in the partial
differential equations modeling these constructions and the presence of these
singularities causes various mathematical problems and physical effects on the
interface surface. In this paper, we analyze the two dimensional cloaking for
Helmholtz equation when there are sources or sinks present inside the cloaked
region. In particular, we consider nonsingular approximate invisibility cloaks
based on the truncation of the singular transformations. Using such truncation
we analyze the limit when the approximate cloaking approaches the ideal
cloaking. We show that, surprisingly, a non-local boundary condition appears on
the inner cloak interface. This effect in the two dimensional (or cylindrical)
invisibility cloaks, which seems to be caused by the infinite phase velocity
near the interface between the cloaked and uncloaked regions, is very different
from the earlier studied behavior of the solutions in the three dimensional
cloaks.

The spectral properties do not vary much over these 4 months, with only a
slight monotonic increase of the hardness ratio with the count rate. This means
that the erratic flaring activity of the source is not associated with spectral
changes, as seen in other ULXs. Conversely, comparison with data obtained by
Swift in 2006 shows a completely different picture: while at a luminosity also
seen in the 2009/2010 data, the source appears with a hard spectrum. Thus, it
appears that, as in Galactic black hole binaries, spectral states in this ULX

obtain hybrid stars with different quark core properties. We also consider the

the distributed average consensus problem in wireless sensor networks. The
network is recursively partitioned into subnetworks. Initially, nodes at the
finest scale gossip to compute local averages. Then, using geographic routing
to enable gossip between nodes that are not directly connected, these local
averages are progressively fused up the hierarchy until the global average is
computed. We show that the proposed hierarchical scheme with $k$ levels of
hierarchy is competitive with state-of-the-art randomized gossip algorithms, in
terms of message complexity, achieving $\epsilon$-accuracy with high
probability after $O\big(n \log \log n \log \frac{kn}{\epsilon} \big)$
messages. Key to our analysis is the way in which the network is recursively
partitioned. We find that the optimal scaling law is achieved when subnetworks
at scale $j$ contain $O(n^{(2/3)^j})$ nodes; then the message complexity at any
individual scale is $O(n \log \frac{kn}{\epsilon})$, and the total number of
scales in the hierarchy grows slowly, as $\Theta(\log \log n)$. Another
important consequence of hierarchical construction is that the longest distance
over which messages are exchanged is $O(n^{1/3})$ hops (at the highest scale),
and most messages (at lower scales) travel shorter distances. In networks that
use link-level acknowledgements, this results in less congestion and resource
usage by reducing message retransmissions. Simulations illustrate that the
proposed scheme is more message-efficient than existing state-of-the-art
randomized gossip algorithms based on averaging along paths.

sub-arcsec/arcsec resolution with the Submillimeter Array at 1.36mm and
456microns, respectively. We detected dust emission arising from two compact
cores, MM1 and MM2, separated by about 7"" (~12000AU in projected distance). MM1
spatially coincides with the powerful thermal radio continuum jet that powers
the very extended molecular outflow, while MM2 is associated with the protostar
that drives the compact molecular outflow recently found in this region.
  High angular resolution obervations at 1.36mm show that MM1 is unresolved and
that MM2 splits into two subcomponents separated by ~1"". The mass of MM1 is
about 4Msun and it has a size of <300AU. This is consistent with MM1 being
associated with a massive and dense (n(H2)>10^9cm-3) circumstellar dusty disk
surrounding a high-mass protostar, which has not developed yet a compact HII
region. On the other hand, the masses of the two separate components of MM2 are
about 2Msun each. One of these components is a compact core with an
intermediate-mass young protostar inside and the other component is probably a
pre-stellar core.
  MM1 is the brigthest source at 1.36mm, while MM2 dominates the emission at
456microns. These are the only (sub)millimeter sources detected in the SMA
observations. Hence, it seems that both sources may contribute significantly to
the bolometric luminosity of the region. Finally, we argue that the
characteristics of these two sources indicate that MM2 is probably in an
earlier evolutionary stage than MM1.

However, up to now, a viable approach for experimentally identifying such
injection has been lacking. We show that electron spin injection into a
spin-blockaded double quantum dot is dramatically manifested in the breaking of
magnetic- field-inversion symmetry of nuclear polarization instabilities. Over
a wide range of parameters, the asymmetry between positive and negative
instability fields is extremely sensitive to the injected electron spin
polarization and allows for the detection of even very weak spin injection.
This phenomenon may be used to investigate the mechanisms of spin transport,
and may hold implications for spin-based information processing.

peaks as notable features for star-forming cloud core collapses under the
self-gravity. In contrast, 25-30 per cent of observed molecular spectral line

`red profiles' with red peaks stronger than blue peaks. Gao & Lou (2010) show
that these unexplained `red profiles' can be signatures of global dynamics for
envelope expansion with core collapse (EECC) within star-forming molecular

HCO+ (J=1-0) and CS (J=2-1) molecular transitions from the low-mass
star-forming cloud core FeSt 1-457 together with its radial profile of column
density inferred from dust extinction observations appear to reveal a
self-similar hydrodynamic shock phase for global EECC. Observed spectral

objective functions. Each valid solution $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ gives rise to an
objective vector in $\R^{d+1}$, and one often wants to enumerate the Pareto
optima among them. In the worst case there may be exponentially many Pareto
optima; however, it was recently shown that in (a generalization of) the
smoothed analysis framework, the expected number is polynomial in $n$.
Unfortunately, the bound obtained had a rather bad dependence on $d$; roughly
$n^{d^d}$. In this paper we show a significantly improved bound of $n^{2d}$.
  Our proof is based on analyzing two algorithms. The first algorithm, on input
a Pareto optimal $x$, outputs a ""testimony"" containing clues about $x$'s
objective vector, $x$'s coordinates, and the region of space $B$ in which $x$'s
objective vector lies. The second algorithm can be regarded as a {\em
speculative} execution of the first -- it can uniquely reconstruct $x$ from the
testimony's clues and just \emph{some} of the probability space's outcomes. The
remainder of the probability space's outcomes are just enough to bound the
probability that $x$'s objective vector falls into the region $B$.

Combined with a jet invariant mass cut, N-subjettiness is an effective

background of QCD jets with large invariant mass. In efficiency studies of
boosted W bosons and top quarks, we find tagging efficiencies of 30% are
achievable with fake rates of 1%. We also consider the discovery potential for

sinking winches mechanism, which is a type of four-cable-driven partly
constrained parallel robot. Conventional studies on forward kinematics of
cable-driven parallel robot assumed that all cables are taut. Actually, given
the lengths of four cables, some cables may be slack when the platform is in
static equilibrium. Therefore, in this paper, the tension state (tautness or
slackness) of cables is considered in the forward kinematics model. We propose
Traversal-Solving-Algorithm, which can indicate the tension state of cables,
and further determine the pose of the platform, if the lengths of four cables
are given. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by four examples. The
results of this paper can be used to control sinking winches mechanism to
achieve the level and stable motion of the platform, and to make the tension
distribution of cables as uniform as possible.

In this form, they can be used even if there are interactions. Specializing to
one and two spacial dimensions, we further show that if two topologically
distinct topological insulators border each other, the difference of their
topological invariants is equal to the difference between the number of zero
energy boundary excitations and the number of zeroes of the Green's function at

thus there are always edge states at the boundary, as is well known. In the

insulators with different topological invariants. This may provide an
alternative explanation to the recent results on one dimensional interacting

properties exhibited by high-ionization, broad emission lines, such as CIV
1549. Specifically we investigate the anti-correlation between L_UV and
emission line EQW (the Baldwin Effect) and the ""blueshifting"" of
high-ionization emission lines. The blueshift of the CIV emission line is
nearly ubiquitous, with a mean shift of 810 km/s for radio-quiet (RQ) quasars
and 360 km/s for radio-loud (RL) quasars, and the Baldwin Effect is present in
both RQ and RL samples. Composite spectra are constructed as a function of CIV
emission line properties in attempt to reveal empirical relationships between
different line species and the SED. Within a two-component disk+wind model of
the broad emission line region (BELR), where the wind filters the continuum
seen by the disk component, we find that RL quasars are consistent with being
dominated by the disk component, while BALQSOs are consistent with being
dominated by the wind component. Some RQ objects have emission line features
similar to RL quasars; they may simply have insufficient black hole (BH) spin
to form radio jets. Our results suggest that there could be significant
systematic errors in the determination of L_bol and BH mass that make it
difficult to place these findings in a more physical context. However, it is
possible to classify quasars in a paradigm where the diversity of BELR
parameters are due to differences in an accretion disk wind between quasars
(and over time); these differences are underlain primarily by the SED, which
ultimately must be tied to BH mass and accretion rate.

Mn0.95Fe0.05 O3 (A= Ca, Sr, Pb, Ba) compounds. All the compositions show
ferromagnetic/metal to paramagnetic/insulator transition except the Pb doped
sample which is insulating and ferromagnetic in the entire temperature range.
The simultaneous occurrence of ferromagnetism and insulating behavior in Pb
doped compound is most likely due to the presence of FM clusters separated by
Fe and Mn ions that are coupled AFM and hence prevent the current from crossing
the inter-domain region. The magnetization and Tc are decreased by decreasing
the Cation size on La site. We observed that (for a fixed Fe content of 5%) the
transition temperature and magnetic moment at 77 K is a maximum for Sr doped
sample and is decreasing if we increase or decrease the cation size from Sr
size. The maximum value of Tc and magnetic moment for Sr based sample is most
likely due to the closer ionic sizes of La and Sr as compared to the other
dopants (Ca, Pb, Ba). The decrease in the transition temperature and magnetic
moment is due to the deviation of Mn-O-Mn angle from 1800 caused by the size
mismatch of the A site cations. This deviation leads to weakening of the FM
double exchange (DE). We observed a spin freezing type effect in the Pb doped
sample below 120 K in resistivity, AC susceptibility and in magnetization. This
suggests that the AFM interactions introduced by the Fe are most effective in
the Pb doped composition leading to increased competition between the FM and
AFM interactions. This FM and AFM interaction generates some degree of
frustration leading to the appearance of spin glass like phase whose typical
magnetic behavior is studied for small ion when the metallic like behavior is
lost.

retrocausal influences in quantum processes in an attempt to alleviate some of
the interpretational difficulties of the Copenhagen interpretation. In response
to Cramer's theory, Maudlin (2002) has levelled a significant objection against
any retrocausal model of quantum mechanics. I present here an examination of
the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics and an analysis of
Maudlin's critique. I claim that, although Maudlin correctly isolates the
weaknesses of Cramer's theory, his justification for this weakness is off the
mark. The cardinal vice of the transactional interpretation is its failure to
provide a sufficient causal structure to constrain uniquely the behaviour of
quantum systems and I contend that this is due to a lack of causal symmetry in
the theory. In contrast, Maudlin attributes this shortcoming to retrocausality
itself and emphasises an apparently fundamental incongruence between
retrocausality and his own metaphysical picture of reality. I conclude by
arguing that the problematic aspect of this incongruence is Maudlin's
assumptions about what is appropriate for such a metaphysical picture.

occurrence of statistical ensemble inequivalence is shown to be related to
previously observed phase transitions in the equilibrium flow topology. We find
in these turbulent flow equilibria, two mechanisms for the appearance of
ensemble equivalences, that were not observed in any physical systems before.
These mechanisms are associated respectively with second-order azeotropy
(simultaneous appearance of two second-order phase transitions), and with
bicritical points (bifurcation from a first-order to two second-order phase
transition lines). The important roles of domain geometry, of topography, and
of a screening length scale (the Rossby radius of deformation) are discussed.
It is found that decreasing the screening length scale (making interactions
more local) surprisingly widens the range of parameters associated with
ensemble inequivalence. These results are then generalized to a larger class of
models, and applied to a complete description of an academic model for inertial
oceanic circulation, the Fofonoff flow.

a way that the complement of the graph is simply connected. In a famous
article, Harer and Zagier established a formula for the generating function of
unicellular maps counted according to the number of vertices and edges. The
keystone of their approach is a counting formula for unicellular maps on
orientable surfaces with $n$ edges, and with vertices colored using every color
in $[q]$ (adjacent vertices are authorized to have the same color). We give an
analogue of this formula for general (locally orientable) surfaces. Our
approach is bijective and is inspired by Lass's proof of the Harer-Zagier
formula. We first revisit Lass's proof and twist it into a bijection between
unicellular maps on orientable surfaces with vertices colored using every color
in $[q]$, and maps with vertex set $[q]$ on orientable surfaces \emph{with a
marked spanning tree}. The bijection immediately implies Harer-Zagier's formula
and a formula by Jackson concerning bipartite unicellular maps. It also shed a
new light on constructions by Goulden and Nica, Schaeffer and Vassilieva, and
Morales and Vassilieva. We then extend the bijection to general surfaces and
obtain a correspondence between unicellular maps on general surfaces with
vertices colored using every color in $[q]$, and maps on orientable surfaces
with vertex set $[q]$ \emph{with a marked planar submap}. This correspondence
gives an analogue of the Harer-Zagier formula for general surfaces. We also
show that this formula implies a recursion formula due to Ledoux for the

sensor networks, cooperative robotics, or ad-hoc networks). We characterize
different classes of self-organization through liveness and safety properties
that both capture information re- garding the system entropy. We illustrate
these classes through study cases. The first ones are two representative P2P
overlays (CAN and Pas- try) and the others are specific implementations of
\Omega (the leader oracle) and one-shot query abstractions for dynamic

existing self-organized protocols and lays the basis of designing robust

spectrum policy enforcement. Compared to other proposed non-interactive
localization algorithms, the weighted centroid localization (WCL) scheme uses
only the received signal strength information, which makes it simple to
implement and robust to variations in the propagation environment. In this
paper we present the first theoretical framework for WCL performance analysis
in terms of its localization error distribution parameterized by node density,
node placement, shadowing variance, correlation distance and inaccuracy of
sensor node positioning. Using this analysis, we quantify the robustness of WCL
to various physical conditions and provide design guidelines, such as node
placement and spacing, for the practical deployment of WCL. We also propose a
power-efficient method for implementing WCL through a distributed cluster-based
algorithm, that achieves comparable accuracy with its centralized counterpart.

the most effective method for studying the reionisation history of hydrogen
and, indirectly, the first galaxies. These studies will be limited not by raw
sensitivity to the signal, but rather, by bright foreground radiation from
Galactic and extragalactic radio sources and the Galactic continuum. In
addition, leakage due to gain errors and non-ideal feeds conspire to further
contaminate low-frequency radio obsevations. This leakage leads to a portion of
the complex linear polarisation signal finding its way into Stokes I, and
inhibits the detection of the non-polarised cosmological signal from the epoch
of reionisation. In this work, we show that rotation measure synthesis can be
used to recover the signature of cosmic hydrogen reionisation in the presence
of contamination by polarised foregrounds. To achieve this, we apply the
rotation measure synthesis technique to the Stokes I component of a synthetic
data cube containing Galactic foreground emission, the effect of instrumental
polarisation leakage, and redshifted 21-cm emission by neutral hydrogen from
the epoch of reionisation. This produces an effective Stokes I Faraday
dispersion function for each line of sight, from which instrumental
polarisation leakage can be fitted and subtracted. Our results show that it is
possible to recover the signature of reionisation in its late stages (z ~ 7) by
way of the 21-cm power spectrum, as well as through tomographic imaging of
ionised cavities in the intergalactic medium.

concentrate mainly on water, methanol, carbon di-oxide, which constitute nearly
90% of the grain mantle. We investigate how the production rates of these

monoxide and constrain the relevant parameter space which reproduces these
molecules closed to the observed abundances. Allowing to accrete only H, O and
CO on the grains and using the Monte-Carlo method we follow the chemical
processes for a few million years. We allow formation of multi-layers on the
grains and incorporate the freeze-out effects of accreting O and CO. We find
that the formation of these molecules depends on the initial conditions as well
as the average cloud density. Specifically, when the number density of
accreting O is less than 3 times more than that of CO, methanol is always
over-produced. Using available reaction pathways it appears to be difficult to
match the exact observed abundances of all the three molecules simultaneously.
Only in a narrow region of parameter space all these three molecules are
produced within the observed limit. In addition to this, we found that the
incorporation of the freeze-outs of O and CO leads to almost steady state on
the grain surface. The mantle thickness grows anywhere between 60 to 500 layers
in a period of two million years. In addition, we consider a case where the gas
number density changes with time due to gradual collapse of the molecular cloud
and present the evolution of composition of different species as a function of

the western boundary of the SNR is perfectly confined by the western molecular
wall. The CO emission fades out from west to east, indicating that the eastern
region is of low gas density. In particular, an intruding finger/pillar-like
MC, which may be shocked at the tip, can well explain the X-ray and radio
enhancement in the southwest and some infrared filaments there. The SNR-MC
interaction is also favored by the relatively elevated 12CO J=2-1/J=1-0 line
ratios in the southwestern ""pillar tip"" and the molecular patch on the
northwestern boundary. The redshifted 12CO (J=1-0 and J=2-1) wings (86-90km/s)
of an eastern 81km/s molecular patch may be the kinematic evidence for shock-MC

self-absorption while the 84km/s MCs at a distance of 6.2 kpc (the tangent
point) are in physical contact with SNR 3C396. The X-ray spectral analysis

show an increase of the Mn-O-Mn bond angle as function of doping and

SXRD as a function of doping are more pronounced than expected from an increase
in bandwitdh due to the increase in Mn-O-Mn bond angle, and are best described
by holes that are distributed at the neighbouring oxygen ions. These holes are
not directly added to the Mn 3d shell, but centered at the Mn site. In

described by an increase of magnetic correlations. This demonstrates the strong
correlations between orbitals and magnetic moments of the 3d states.

Subsequently, we use the established existence results to construct solutions

function of colour, luminosity and redshift, and we do not a-priori assume that
LRGs constitute a uniform population of galaxies in terms of stellar evolution.
By computing star-formation histories from the fossil record, the measured
stellar evolution of the galaxies is decoupled from the survey's selection
function, which also evolves with redshift. We present these evolutionary
models computed using three different sets of Stellar Population Synthesis
(SPS) codes. We show that the traditional fiducial model of purely passive
stellar evolution of LRGs is broadly correct, but it is not sufficient to
explain the full spectral signature. We also find that higher-order corrections
to this model are dependent on the SPS used, particularly when calculating the
amount of recent star formation. The amount of young stars can be
non-negligible in some cases, and has important implications for the
interpretation of the number density of LRGs within the selection box as a
function of redshift. Dust extinction, however, is more robust to the SPS
modelling: extinction increases with decreasing luminosity, increasing
redshift, and increasing r-i colour. We are making the colour evolution tracks

deuteron is of great interest, especially in connection with the possibilities
of COSY and GSI. These polarizabilities can be measured in storage rings by the
frozen spin method providing a disappearance of g-2 precession. This method
will be used in the planned deuteron electric-dipole-moment experiment in
storage rings. The tensor electric polarizability of the deuteron significantly
influences the buildup of the vertical polarization in the above experiment.
The spin interactions depending on the electric dipole moment, the tensor
electric polarizability, and main systematical errors caused by field
misalignments have very different symmetries. For the considered experimental
conditions, the sensitivity to the deuteron EDM of $1\times10^{-29} e\cdot$cm
corresponds to measuring the both of tensor polarizabilities with an accuracy
of $\delta\alpha_T\approx\delta\beta_T\approx5\times10^{-42}$ cm$^3$. This
conservative estimate can be improved by excluding the systematical error
caused by the field instability which is negligible for the measurement of the
tensor polarizabilities. To find the tensor magnetic polarizability, the
horizontal components of the polarization vector should be measured.

valence-band, core-level, and Cr 2p - 3d resonant photoemission spectroscopy
(PES). Despite its antiferromagnetic order, a clear Fermi edge characteristic
of a metal with dominant Cr 3d character is observed in the valence band
spectrum. The Cr 3d single particle density of states are spread over 2 eV,
with the photoemission spectral weight distributed in two peaks centered at ~
1.2 eV and 0.2 eV below EF, suggestive of the coherent and incoherent states
resulting from strong electron-electron correlations. Resonant PES across the
Cr 2p - 3d threshold identifies a 'two-hole' correlation satellite and yields
an on-site Coulomb energy U ~4.8 eV. The metallic DOS at EF is also reflected
through the presence of a well-screened feature at low binding energy side of
the Cr 2p core-level spectrum. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at Cr L3,2
and O K edges exhibit small temperature dependent changes that point towards a
small change in Cr-O hybridization. The multiplet splitting in Cr 2p core level
spectrum as well as the spectral shape of the Cr XAS can be reproduced using
cluster model calculations which favour a negative value for charge transfer
energy between the Cr 3d and O 2p states. The overall results indicate that
CaCrO3 is a strongly hybridized antiferromagnetic metal, lying in the regime
intermediate to Mott-Hubbard and charge-transfer systems.

often reported in the media. While overall rankings can vary markedly over
relatively short time periods, it is not unusual to find that the ranks of a
small number of ""highly performing"" institutions remain fixed, even when the
data on which the rankings are based are extensively revised, and even when a
large number of new institutions are added to the competition. In the present
paper, we endeavor to model this phenomenon. In particular, we interpret as a
random variable the value of the attribute on which the ranking should ideally
be based. More precisely, if $p$ items are to be ranked then the true, but
unobserved, attributes are taken to be values of $p$ independent and
identically distributed variates. However, each attribute value is observed
only with noise, and via a sample of size roughly equal to $n$, say. These
noisy approximations to the true attributes are the quantities that are
actually ranked. We show that, if the distribution of the true attributes is
light-tailed (e.g., normal or exponential) then the number of institutions
whose ranking is correct, even after recalculation using new data and even
after many new institutions are added, is essentially fixed. Formally, $p$ is
taken to be of order $n^C$ for any fixed $C>0$, and the number of institutions
whose ranking is reliable depends very little on $p$.

The Rb lamp is used in exciting the ground state hyperfine transitions in Rb

of these hyperfine transitions is very stable it is used in the development of
Rb atomic clock by phase locking the oven controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO)

presented in the paper.The Lamp is ideally operated in ring mode as in this
mode the linewidth is narrow and there is no self reversal. However, high

gives rise to line broadening and self reversal. It is the experience that mode
change from ring to red deteriorates the atomic signal strength and S/N. In

storage that, like Reed-Solomon codes, permit data recovery from any subset of
k nodes within the n-node network. However, regenerating codes possess in
addition, the ability to repair a failed node by connecting to an arbitrary
subset of d nodes. It has been shown that for the case of functional-repair,
there is a tradeoff between the amount of data stored per node and the
bandwidth required to repair a failed node. A special case of functional-repair
is exact-repair where the replacement node is required to store data identical
to that in the failed node. Exact-repair is of interest as it greatly
simplifies system implementation. The first result of the paper is an explicit,
exact-repair code for the point on the storage-bandwidth tradeoff corresponding
to the minimum possible repair bandwidth, for the case when d=n-1. This code
has a particularly simple graphical description and most interestingly, has the
ability to carry out exact-repair through mere transfer of data and without any
need to perform arithmetic operations. Hence the term `repair-by-transfer'. The
second result of this paper shows that the interior points on the
storage-bandwidth tradeoff cannot be achieved under exact-repair, thus pointing
to the existence of a separate tradeoff under exact-repair. Specifically, we
identify a set of scenarios, termed `helper node pooling', and show that it is
the necessity to satisfy such scenarios that over-constrains the system.

of this master equation is derived order by order in the hybridization between
dot and leads. Although the generator turns out to be closely related to the
T-matrix expressions for the transition rates, which are plagued by
divergences, in the time-convolutionless generator all divergences cancel order
by order. The time-convolutionless and T-matrix master equations are contrasted
to the Nakajima-Zwanzig version. The absence of divergences in the
Nakajima-Zwanzig master equation due to the nonexistence of secular reducible
contributions becomes rather transparent in our approach, which explicitly
projects out these contributions. We also show that the time-convolutionless

recently solved by H.Pfitzner in the positive. In this note we collect some
stronger versions of the solution to the Boundary Problem, most of which are
restricted to special types of Banach spaces. We shall use the results and
techniques of Pfitzner, Cascales et al., Moors and others.

(1) these materials possess a usually large, high-temperature magnetoelectric

magnitude near their respective N\'eel temperature; (2) Li and K doping can
readily vary the ratio of cubic to hexagonal layers and cause drastic changes
in dielectric and magnetic properties; in particular, a mere 3% Li substitution
for Mn significantly weakens the magnetic anisotropy and relaxes the lattice;
consequently, the dielectric constant for both the a- and c-axis sharply rises
to 2500 near the N\'eel temperature. This lattice softening is also accompanied
by weak polarization. These findings provide a new paradigm for developing
novel, high-temperature magnetoelectric materials that may eventually

a normal interstellar extinction law. The best fit of the dereddened colours to
the intrinsic colours giving a minimum value of Chi^2 then yields the
corresponding spectral type and A_V for the star. The main sequence stars, thus
classified, are then utilized in an A V versus distance plot to bracket the
cloud distances. Results: We applied the method to four clouds, L1517,

several mJy at 1.4GHz, but that are invisible at 3.6um when using sensitive
Spitzer observations with uJy sensitivities. Their nature is unclear and
difficult to investigate since they are only visible in the radio.
High-resolution radio images and comprehensive spectral coverage can yield
constraints on the emission mechanisms of IFRS and can give hints to
similarities with known objects. We imaged a sample of 17 IFRS at 4.8GHz and
8.6GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array to determine the structures
on arcsecond scales. We added radio data from other observing projects and from
the literature to obtain broad-band radio spectra. We find that the sources in
our sample are either resolved out at the higher frequencies or are compact at
resolutions of a few arcsec, which implies that they are smaller than a typical
galaxy. The spectra of IFRS are remarkably steep, with a median spectral index
of -1.4 and a prominent lack of spectral indices larger than -0.7. We also find
that, given the IR non-detections, the ratio of 1.4GHz flux density to 3.6um
flux density is very high, and this puts them into the same regime as
high-redshift radio galaxies. The evidence that IFRS are predominantly
high-redshift sources driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) is strong, even
though not all IFRS may be caused by the same phenomenon. Compared to the rare
and painstakingly collected high-redshift radio galaxies, IFRS appear to be
much more abundant, but less luminous, AGN-driven galaxies at similar
cosmological distances.

However, if we take into account metastable states (for a restricted class of
perturbations), we find a very rich phenomenology. In particular, the system
displays a region of negative specific heats in the microcanonical ensemble in
which the temperature decreases as the energy increases. This leads to
ensembles inequivalence and to zeroth order phase transitions similar to the
""gravothermal catastrophe"" and to the ""isothermal collapse"" of self-gravitating
systems. In the present case, they correspond to the reorganization of the
system from an ""anti-aligned"" phase (magnetization pointing in the direction
opposite to the magnetic field) to an ""aligned"" phase (magnetization pointing
in the same direction as the magnetic field). We also find that the magnetic
susceptibility can be negative in the microcanonical ensemble so that the
magnetization decreases as the magnetic field increases. The magnetic curves
can take various shapes depending on the values of energy or temperature. We
describe hysteretic cycles involving positive or negative susceptibilities. We
also show that this model exhibits gaps in the magnetization at fixed energy,

understood from the coupling of charge carriers to some kind of dynamical order
which we exemplify in terms of fluctuating charge and spin density waves. Two
theoretical models are investigated which capture different aspects of such
dynamical scattering. The first approach leaves the ground state in the
disordered phase but couples the electrons to bosonic degrees of freedom,
corresponding to the quasi singular scattering associated with the closeness to
an ordered phase. The second, more phenomological approach starts from the
construction of a frequency dependent order parameter which vanishes for small
energies. Both theories capture scanning tunneling microscopy and angle-resoved
photoemission experiments which suggest the protection of quasiparticles close
to the Fermi energy but the manifestation of long-range order at higher
frequencies.

objects simultaneously, to investigate, e.g., the joint evolution of
star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei. VLBI observations can yield
valuable input to such studies because they are able to identify AGN. However,
VLBI observations of large swaths of the sky are impractical using standard
methods, because the fields of view of VLBI observations are of the order of
10"" or less. We have embarked on a project to carry out Very Long Baseline
Array (VLBA) observations of all 96 known radio sources in one of the
best-studied areas in the sky, the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS). The
challenge was to develop methods which could significantly reduce the amount of
observing (and post-processing) time. We have developed an extension to the
DiFX software correlator which allows one to correlate hundreds of positions
within the primary beams. This extension enabled us to target many sources, at
full resolution and high sensitivity, using only a small amount of observing
time. The combination of wide fields-of-view and high sensitivity across the
field in this survey is unprecedented. We have observed with the VLBA a single
pointing containing the Chandra Deep Field South, in which 96 radio sources
were known from previous observations with the ATCA. From our input sample, 20
were detected with the VLBA. The majority of objects have flux densities in
agreement with arcsec-scale observations, implying that their radio emission
comes from very small regions. One VLBI-detected object had earlier been
classified as a star-forming galaxy. Comparing the VLBI detections to sources
found in sensitive, co-located X-ray observations we find that X-ray detections
are not a good indicator for VLBI detections. Wide-field VLBI survey science is

modes in a simple bead-spring model for non-entangled polymer blends. Two
different models are used for the fast component, namely fully-flexible and
semiflexible chains. The latter are semiflexible in the meaning that static
intrachain correlations are strongly non-gaussian at all length scales. The
dynamic asymmetry in the blend is strongly enhanced by decreasing temperature,
inducing confinement effects on the fast component. The dynamics of the Rouse
modes show very different trends for the two models of the fast component. For
the fully-flexible case, the relaxation times exhibit a progressive deviation
from Rouse scaling on increasing the dynamic asymmetry. This anomalous effect
has a dynamic origin. It is not related to particular static features of the
Rouse modes, which indeed are identical to those of the fully-flexible
homopolymer, and are not modified by the dynamic asymmetry in the blend. On the
contrary, in the semiflexible case the relaxation times exhibit approximately
the same scaling behaviour as the amplitudes of the modes. This suggests that
the origin of the anomalous dynamic scaling for semiflexible chains confined in
the blend is esentially of static nature. We discuss implications of these
observations for the applicability of theoretical approaches to chain dynamics
in polymer blends.

We have developed a novel method to detect a giant planet still embedded in a
circumstellar disk by the distortions of the CO molecular line profiles
emerging from the protoplanetary disk's surface. The method is based on the
fact that a giant planet significantly perturbs the gas velocity flow in
addition to distorting the disk surface density. We have calculated the
emerging molecular line profiles by combining hydrodynamical models with
semianalytic radiative transfer calculations. Our results have shown that a
giant Jupiter-like planet can be detected using contemporary or future
high-resolution near-IR spectrographs such as VLT/CRIRES or ELT/METIS. We have
also studied the effects of binarity on disk perturbations. The most
interesting results have been found for eccentric circumprimary disks in
mid-separation binaries, for which the disk eccentricity - detectable from the
asymmetric line profiles - arises from the gravitational effects of the
companion star. Our detailed simulations shed new light on how to constrain the
disk kinematical state as well as its eccentricity profile. Recent findings by
independent groups have shown that core-accretion is severely affected by disk
eccentricity, hence detection of an eccentric protoplanetary disk in a young
binary system would further constrain planet formation theories.
