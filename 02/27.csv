  Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We are interested in unicast traffic over wireless networks that employ
constructive inter-session network coding, including single-hop and multi-hop
schemes. In this setting, TCP flows do not fully exploit the network coding
opportunities due to their bursty behavior and due to the fact that TCP is
agnostic to the underlying network coding. In order to improve the performance
of TCP flows over coded wireless networks, we take the following steps. First,
we formulate the problem as network utility maximization and we present a
distributed solution. Second, mimicking the structure of the optimal solution,
we propose a ""network-coding aware"" queue management scheme (NCAQM) at
intermediate nodes; we make no changes to TCP or to the MAC protocol (802.11).
We demonstrate, via simulation, that NCAQM significantly improves TCP
performance compared to TCP over baseline schemes.

of its nucleus at nine epochs in the phase angle range 0 - 20 deg. For each

result fully consistent with previous studies. Using the albedo-polarization

(IMBHs) at the centre of globular clusters is a hot and controversial topic in
current astrophysical research with important implications in stellar and
galaxy formation.
  Aims. In this paper, we aim at giving further support to the presence of an
IMBH in omega Centauri and at providing an independent estimate of its mass.
  Methods. We employed a self-consistent spherical model with anisotropic
velocity distribution. It consists in a generalisation of the King model by
including the Bahcall-Wolf distribution function in the IMBH vicinity.
  Results. By the parametric fitting of the model to recent HST/ACS data for
the surface brightness profile, we found an IMBH to cluster total mass ratio of
M_BH/M = 5.8(+0.9-1.2) x 10^(-3). It is also found that the model yields a fit
of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile that is better without mass
segregation than in the segregated case. This confirms the current thought of a
non-relaxed status for this peculiar cluster. The best fit model to the
kinematic data leads, moreover, to a cluster total mass estimate of M = (3.1
+/- 0.3) x 10^6 Msol, thus giving an IMBH mass in the range 13,000 < M_BH <
23,000 Msol (at 1-sigma confidence level). A slight degree of radial velocity
anisotropy in the outer region (r > 12') is required to match the outer surface
brightness profile.

centrifugal force makes it contract. This perturbs each fluid element, raising
the local pressure and originating deviations from beta equilibrium that
enhance the neutrino emissivity and produce thermal energy. This mechanism is
named rotochemical heating and has previously been studied for neutron stars of
non-superfluid matter, finding that they reach a quasi-steady state in which
the rate that the spin-down modifies the equilibrium concentrations is the same
to that of the neutrino reactions restoring the equilibrium. On the other hand,
the neutron star interior is believed to contain superfluid nucleons, which
affect the thermal evolution of the star by suppressing the neutrino reactions
and the specific heat, and opening new Cooper pairing reactions.
  In this work we describe the thermal effects of Cooper pairing with spatially
uniform energy gaps of neutrons and protons on rotochemical heating in
millisecond pulsars (MSPs) when only modified Urca reactions are allowed. We
find that the chemical imbalances grow up to a value close to the energy gaps,
which is higher than the one of the nonsuperfluid case. Therefore, the surface
temperatures predicted with Cooper pairing are higher and explain the recent

Wald on geodesic motion in general relativity
can be generalized to classical field theories of a metric and other tensor
fields on four-dimensional spacetime that 1) are second-order and 2) follow
from a diffeomorphism-covariant Lagrangian. The approach is to consider a
one-parameter-family of solutions to the field equations satisfying certain
assumptions designed to reflect the existence of a body whose size, mass, and
various charges are simultaneously scaled to zero. (That such solutions exist
places a further restriction on the class of theories to which our results
apply.) Assumptions are made only on the spacetime region outside of the body,
so that the results apply to ordinary bodies as well as black holes. The
worldline ""left behind"" by the shrinking, disappearing body is interpreted as
its lowest-order motion. An equation for this worldline follows from the
""Bianchi identity"" for the theory, without use of any properties of the field
equations beyond their being second-order. The form of the force law for a
theory therefore depends only on the ranks of its various tensor fields, with
the field equations relevant only for determining the charges of a particular
body from its exterior fields. I explicitly derive the force law (and
mass-evolution law) in the case of scalar and vector fields, and give the
recipe in the higher-rank case. Note that the vector force law is quite
complicated, simplifying to the Lorentz force law only in the presence of the
Maxwell gauge symmetry. Example applications of the results are the motion of
""chameleon"" bodies beyond the Newtonian limit, and the motion of bodies in

supernova remnant during the ejecta-dominated phase are known to produce
finger-like structures in the matter distribution which modify the geometry of
the remnant. The morphology of supernova remnants is also expected to be
modified when efficient particle acceleration occurs at their shocks. Aims: The
impact of the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities from the ejecta-dominated to the
Sedov-Taylor phase is investigated over one octant of the supernova remnant. We
also study the effect of efficient particle acceleration at the forward shock
on the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Methods: We modified the
Adaptive Mesh Refinement code RAMSES to study with hydrodynamic numerical
simulations the evolution of supernova remnants in the framework of an
expanding reference frame. The adiabatic index of a relativistic gas between
the forward shock and the contact discontinuity mimics the presence of
accelerated particles. Results: The great advantage of the super-comoving
coordinate system adopted here is that it minimizes numerical diffusion at the
contact discontinuity, since it is stationary with respect to the grid. We
propose an accurate expression for the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor structures
that connects smoothly the early growth to the asymptotic self-similar
behaviour. Conclusions: The development of the Rayleigh-Taylor structures is
affected, although not drastically, if the blast wave is dominated by cosmic
rays. The amount of ejecta that makes it into the shocked interstellar medium
is smaller in the latter case. If acceleration occurs at both shocks the extent
of the Rayleigh-Taylor structures is similar but the reverse shock is strongly
perturbed.

(ISM) column density and the 408 Mhz sky are good proxies for neutral pion and
inverse Compton (IC) gamma-ray emission, respectively. We identify significant
systematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional
diffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray

ratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,
and of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models
and simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM
template underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by
approximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to
under-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate
it at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend
crucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy. The size of
the systematic effects we find are comparable to the size of the claimed ""Fermi
haze"" signal. We thus conclude that a detailed model for the galactic diffuse
emission is necessary in order to conclusively assess the presence of a
gamma-ray excess possibly associated to the WMAP haze morphology.

shear value is quantified for discrete source redshifts, as well as for a set
of sources that are broadly distributed in redshift space. In general, the
closest lens in projection on the sky is not the only lens for a given source.
In addition, ~50% of the time the closest lens is not the most important lens
for a given source. Compared to a naive single-deflection calculation in which
only the lensing due to the closest weak lens is considered, a full
multiple-deflection calculation yields a higher net shear for individual
sources, as well as a higher mean tangential shear around the lens centers. The
full multiple-deflection calculation also shows that galaxy-galaxy lensing may
contribute a substantial amount to cosmic shear on small angular scales. The
degree to which galaxy-galaxy lensing contributes to the small-scale cosmic
shear is, however, quite sensitive to the mass adopted for the halos of L_B*
galaxies. Changing the halo mass by a factor of ~2.5 changes the contribution
of galaxy-galaxy lensing to the cosmic shear by a factor of ~3 on scales of
order 1 arcmin. The contribution of galaxy-galaxy lensing to cosmic shear
decreases rapidly with angular scale and extrapolates to zero at scales of
order 5 arcmin. This last result is roughly independent of the halo mass and
suggests that for scales greater than about 5 arcmin, cosmic shear is
insensitive to the details of the gravitational potentials of large galaxies.

models. This allows it to be exploited reliably in high-redshift and low mass
regimes. Furthermore, we have performed an exhaustive search of model parameter
space to find a particular set of model parameters which produce results in
good agreement with a wide range of observational data (luminosity functions,
galaxy sizes and dynamics, clustering, colours, metal content) over a wide
range of redshifts. This model represents a solid basis on which to perform
calculations of galaxy formation in as yet unprobed regimes.

calculation of rates for excitation by collisions with the most abundant
species. The present paper focuses on the calculation of rate coefficients for
rotational excitation of the HCN and HNC molecules in their ground vibrational
state in collision with He. The calculations are based on new two-dimensional
potential energy surfaces obtained from highly correlated \textit{ab initio}
calculations. Calculations of pure rotational (de)excitation cross sections of
HCN and HNC by He were performed using the essentially exact close-coupling
method. Cross sections for transitions among the 8 first rotational levels of
HCN and HNC were calculated for kinetic energies up to 1000 cm$^{-1}$. These
cross sections were used to determine collisional rate constants for
temperatures ranging from 5 K to 100 K. A propensity for even $\Delta j$
transitions is observed in the case of HCN--He collisions whereas a propensity
for odd $\Delta j$ transitions is observed in the case of HNC--He collisions.
The consequences for astrophysical models are evaluated and it is shown that
the use of HCN rate coefficients to interpret HNC observations can lead to
significant inaccuracies in the determination of the HNC abundance, in
particular in cold dark clouds for which the new HNC rates show that the
$j=1-0$ line of this species will be more easily excited by collisions than
HCN. An important result of the new HNC-He rates is that the HNC/HCN abundance
ratio derived from observations in cold clouds has to be revised from $>$1 to
$\simeq$1, in good agreement with detailed chemical models available in the
literature.

studies, and we use more accurate redshifts for the host galaxies, with 8 CO
molecular line redshifts and 9 MgII redshifts. We confirm the trend for an
increase in NZ size with decreasing redshift, with the luminosity normalized
proper size evolving as: R_{NZ,corrected} = (7.4 \pm 0.3) - (8.0 \pm 1.1)
\times (z-6) Mpc. While derivation of the absolute neutral fraction remains
difficult with this technique, the evolution of the NZ sizes suggests a
decrease in the neutral fraction of intergalactic hydrogen by a factor ~ 9.4
from z=6.4 to 5.7, in its simplest interpretation. Alternatively, recent
numerical simulations suggest that this rapid increase in near-zone size from
z=6.4 to 5.7 is due to the rapid increase in the background photo-ionization
rate at the end of the percolation or overlap phase, when the average mean free
path of ionizing photons increases dramatically. In either case, the results
are consistent with the idea that z ~ 6 to 7 corresponds to the tail end of
cosmic reionization. The scatter in the normalized NZ sizes is larger than
expected simply from measurement errors, and likely reflects intrinsic
differences in the quasars or their environments. We find that the near-zone
sizes increase with quasar UV luminosity, as expected for photo-ionization
dominated by quasar radiation.

estimating the likelihood of occurrence of an extreme event given the
observations of smaller events while the complete internal dynamics of the
system is unknown. We look for premonitory patterns that emerge as an extreme
event approaches; those patterns are deviations from the long-term system's
averages. We have found a single control parameter that governs multiple
spatio-temporal premonitory patterns. For that purpose, we derive i) complete
analytic description of time- and space-dependent size distribution of
particles generated by a single immigrant; ii) the steady-state moments that
correspond to multiple immigrants; and iii) size- and space-based asymptotic
for the particle size distribution. Our results suggest a mechanism for

z=0.359. Source CXOCJ100043.1+020637 (CID-42) presents two compact optical
sources embedded in the same galaxy. The distance between the 2, measured in
the HST/ACS image, is 0.495"" that, at the redshift of the source, corresponds
to a projected separation of 2.46 kpc. A large (~1200 km/s) velocity offset
between the narrow and broad components of Hbeta has been measured in three
different optical spectra from the VLT/VIMOS and Magellan/IMACS instruments.
CID-42 is also the only X-ray source having in its X-ray spectra a strong
redshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing an
inverted P-Cygni profile. The Chandra and XMM data show that the absorption
line is variable in energy by 500 eV over 4 years and that the absorber has to
be highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft X-ray
spectrum. That these features occur in the same source is unlikely to be a
coincidence. We envisage two possible explanations: (1) a gravitational wave
recoiling black hole (BH), caught 1-10 Myr after merging, (2) a Type 1/ Type 2
system in the same galaxy where the Type 1 is recoiling due to slingshot effect
produced by a triple BH system. The first possibility gives us a candidate
gravitational waves recoiling BH with both spectroscopic and imaging
signatures. In the second case, the X-ray absorption line can be explained as a
BAL-like outflow from the foreground nucleus (a Type 2 AGN) at the rearer one
(a Type 1 AGN), which illuminates the otherwise undetectable wind, giving us
the first opportunity to show that fast winds are present in obscured AGN.

Yang-Mills instantons yields good approximations to static Skyrmion solutions
of the Skyrme model. This paper provides an extension and explanation of this
result, by proving that instanton holonomies produce exact solutions of a BPS
Skyrme model, in which the Skyrme field is coupled to a tower of vector mesons.
Neglecting any (or indeed all) of the vector mesons breaks the scale invariance
and removes the BPS property of the Skyrmions. However, it is shown that a
truncation of the BPS Skyrme theory, in which only the first vector meson is
included, already moves the Skyrme model significantly closer to the BPS
system. A theory that is close to a BPS system is required to reproduce the
experimental data on binding energies of nuclei. A zero-mode quantization of
the Skyrmion is performed in the truncated BPS theory and the results are
compared to the physical properties of the nucleon. The approach is an analogue
in five-dimensional Minkowski spacetime of a recent holographic construction of
a Skyrme model by Sakai and Sugimoto, based on a string theory derivation of a
Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory in a curved five-dimensional spacetime.

use measurement scale as a type of information constraint. We argue that a very
common measurement scale is linear at small magnitudes grading into logarithmic
at large magnitudes, leading to observations that often follow Student's
probability distribution which has a Gaussian shape for small fluctuations from
the mean and a power law shape for large fluctuations from the mean. An inverse
scaling often arises in which measures naturally grade from logarithmic to
linear as one moves from small to large magnitudes, leading to observations
that often follow a gamma probability distribution. A gamma distribution has a
power law shape for small magnitudes and an exponential shape for large
magnitudes. The two measurement scales are natural inverses connected by the
Laplace integral transform. This inversion connects the two major scaling
patterns commonly found in nature. We also show that superstatistics is a
special case of an integral transform, and thus can be understood as a
particular way in which to change the scale of measurement. Incorporating
information about measurement scale into maximum entropy provides a general
approach to the relations between measurement, information and probability.

up foreground/background interlopers (FBIs), that lie within the virial cone
(VC), but outside the virial sphere. Structural & kinematic deprojection
equations are not known for an expanding Universe, where the Hubble flow (HF)
stretches the line-of-sight (LOS) distribution of velocities. We analyze 93
mock relaxed clusters, built from a cosmological simulation. The stacked mock
cluster is well fit by an m=5 Einasto DM density profile (but only out to 1.5
virial radii [r_v]), with velocity anisotropy (VA) close to the Mamon-Lokas
model with VA radius equal to that of density slope -2. The surface density of
FBIs is nearly flat out to r_v, while their LOS velocity distribution shows a
dominant gaussian cluster-outskirts component and a flat field component. This
distribution of FBIs in projected phase space is nearly universal in mass. A
local k=2.7 sigma velocity cut returns the LOS velocity dispersion profile
(LOSVDP) expected from the NFW density and VA profiles measured in 3D. The HF
causes a shallower outer LOSVDP that cannot be well matched by the Einasto
model for any k. After this velocity cut, FBIs still account for 23% of DM
particles within the VC (close to the observed fraction of cluster galaxies
lying off the Red Sequence). The best-fit projected NFW/Einasto models
underestimate the 3D concentration by 6+/-6% (16+/-7%) after (before) the
velocity cut, unless a constant background is included in the fit. Assuming the
correct mass profile, the VA profile is well recovered from the measured
LOSVDP, with a slight bias towards more radial orbits in the outer regions.
These small biases are overshadowed by large cluster-cluster variations caused
by cosmic variance. An appendix provides an analytical approximation to the
surface density, projected mass and tangential shear profiles of the Einasto
model.

We show that any cost function based prediction market can be interpreted as an

equating trades made in the market with losses observed by the learning
algorithm. If the loss of the market organizer is bounded, this bound can be
used to derive an O(sqrt(T)) regret bound for the corresponding learning

exactly corresponds to the class of Follow the Regularized Leader learning
algorithms, with the choice of a cost function in the market corresponding to
the choice of a regularizer in the learning problem. Finally, we show an
equivalence between market scoring rules and prediction markets with convex
cost functions. This implies that market scoring rules can also be interpreted
naturally as Follow the Regularized Leader algorithms, and may be of

commonly studied markets, such as the Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule, can
aggregate opinions into accurate estimates of the likelihood of future events.

the sea-serpent phenomenon is a consequence of magnetoconvection in a strongly
inclined magnetic field. It involves several physical processes: filamentary
structurization, high-speed overturning convective motions in strong, almost
horizontal magnetic fields with partially frozen field lines, and traveling
convective waves. The results demonstrate a correlation of the bipolar magnetic
patches with high-speed Evershed downflows in the penumbra. This is the first

magnetic fields, an essential ingredient of sunspot penumbrae that has eluded

obtained over more than three weeks with eleven telescopes. A new method for
adjusting the data weights allows us to suppress the sidelobes in the power

two clear ridges that we identify with even and odd values of the angular
degree (l=0 and 2, and l=1 and 3, respectively). We interpret a strong, narrow
peak at 446 muHz that lies close to the l=1 ridge as a mode with mixed

separations are useful diagnostics for asteroseismology. In particular,
variations in the large separation appear to indicate a glitch in the
sound-speed profile at an acoustic depth of about 1000 s. We list frequencies
for 55 modes extracted from the data spanning 20 radial orders, a range
comparable to the best solar data, which will provide valuable constraints for
theoretical models. A preliminary comparison with published models shows that
the offset between observed and calculated frequencies for the radial modes is
very different for Procyon than for the Sun and other cool stars. We find the
mean lifetime of the modes in Procyon to be 1.29 +0.55/-0.49 days, which is
significantly shorter than the 2-4 days seen in the Sun.

communication of time-critical data. Energy wastage can be caused by failed

propose a transmission controller that utilizes different ""grades"" of channel
side information to schedule packet transmissions in an optimal way, while
meeting a deadline constraint for all packets waiting in the transmission
queue. The wireless channel is modeled as a finite-state Markov channel. We are
specifically interested in the case where the transmitter has low-grade channel
side information that can be obtained based solely on the ACK/NAK sequence for
the previous transmissions. Our scheduler is readily implementable and it is
based on the dynamic programming solution to the finite-horizon transmission
control problem. We also calculate the information theoretic capacity of the
finite state Markov channel with feedback containing different grades of
channel side information including that, obtained through the ACK/NAK sequence.
We illustrate that our scheduler achieves a given throughput at a power level
that is fairly close to the fundamental limit achievable over the channel.

through these sub-Larmor-scale magnetic fields radiate in the jitter regime, in
which the anisotropy of the magnetic fields and the particle distribution have
a strong effect on the produced radiation. Here we develop the general theory
of jitter radiation, which includes (i) anisotropic magnetic fields and

(iii) extends the description to large deflection angles of radiating particles

obtained from particle-in-cell simulations of the classical Weibel instability.
Particularly interesting is the onset of the field growth, when the transient
hard synchrotron-violating spectra are common as a result of the dominant role
of the trapped population. This effect can serve as a distinct observational
signature of the violent field growth in astrophysical sources and lab
experiments. It is also interesting that a system with small-scale fields tends

To improve its performance, this paper presents randomized lattice decoding
based on Klein's sampling technique, which is a randomized version of Babai's
nearest plane algorithm (i.e., successive interference cancelation (SIC)). To
find the closest lattice point, Klein's algorithm is used to sample some
lattice points and the closest among those samples is chosen. Lattice reduction
increases the probability of finding the closest lattice point, and only needs
to be run once during pre-processing. Further, the sampling can operate very
efficiently in parallel. The technical contribution of this paper is two-fold:
we analyze and optimize the decoding radius of sampling decoding resulting in
better error performance than Klein's original algorithm, and propose a very
efficient implementation of random rounding. Of particular interest is that a
fixed gain in the decoding radius compared to Babai's decoding can be achieved
at polynomial complexity. The proposed decoder is useful for moderate
dimensions where sphere decoding becomes computationally intensive, while
lattice reduction-aided decoding starts to suffer considerable loss. Simulation
results demonstrate near-ML performance is achieved by a moderate number of
samples, even if the dimension is as high as 32.

the end of the inflationary era. An additional goal of this work is to
distinguish between light fields which can/cannot be ignored during inflation.
Such criteria become useful for examining cosmological scenarios with multiple

especially in scenarios dealing with human activity rather than natural

It is to be expected in such cases that learning algorithms will have to deal
with manipulated data aimed at hampering decision making. Although some
previous work addressed the handling of malicious data in the context of
supervised learning, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly
detection methods in such scenarios. In this contribution we analyze the
performance of a particular method -- online centroid anomaly detection -- in
the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following
security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes,
derivation of an optimal attack, analysis of its efficiency and constraints. We
derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid
anomaly under different conditions: bounded and unbounded percentage of
traffic, and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a
poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be
made arbitrarily difficult (a strict upper bound on the attacker's gain) if
external constraints are properly used. Our experimental evaluation carried out
on real HTTP and exploit traces confirms the tightness of our theoretical
bounds and practicality of our protection mechanisms.

has varied over its existence and its possible relevance to both the origin and
the evolution of life. Much of the analysis relates to the 'high energy' cosmic
rays ($E>10^{14}eV;=0.1PeV$) and their variability due to the changing
proximity of the solar system to supernova remnants which are generally
believed to be responsible for most cosmic rays up to PeV energies. It is
pointed out that, on a statistical basis, there will have been considerable
variations in the likely 100 My between the Earth's biosphere reaching
reasonable stability and the onset of very elementary life. Interestingly,
there is the increasingly strong possibility that PeV cosmic rays are
responsible for the initiation of terrestrial lightning strokes and the
possibility arises of considerable increases in the frequency of lightnings and
thereby the formation of some of the complex molecules which are the 'building
blocks of life'. Attention is also given to the well known generation of the
oxides of nitrogen by lightning strokes which are poisonous to animal life but
helpful to plant growth; here, too, the violent swings of cosmic ray
intensities may have had relevance to evolutionary changes. A particular
variant of the cosmic ray acceleration model, put forward by us, predicts an
increase in lightning rate in the past and this has been sought in Korean
historical records. Finally, the time dependence of the overall cosmic ray
intensity, which manifests itself mainly at sub-10 GeV energies, has been
examined. The relevance of cosmic rays to the 'global electrical circuit'
points to the importance of this concept.

Cooperators pay a benefit b to their neighbors at a cost c, whereas defectors

Although it has been widely thought that b/c> <k> is a condition of favoring
cooperation, we find that b/c> <knn> is the condition. We also show that among
three representative networks, namely, regular, random, and scale-free, a
regular network favors cooperation the most, whereas a scale-free network
favors cooperation the least. In an ideal scale-free network where network size
is infinite, cooperation is never realized. Whether or not the scale-free
network and network heterogeneity favor cooperation depends on the details of a
game, although it is occasionally believed that scale-free networks favor
cooperation irrespective of game structures. If the number of players are
small, then the cooperation is favored in scale-free networks.

(OFDM) system with a decode-and-forward (DF) relay is considered. The
transmission consists of two hops. The source transmits in the first hop, and
the relay transmits in the second hop. Each hop occupies one time slot. The
relay is half-duplex, and capable of decoding the message on a particular
subcarrier in one time slot, and re-encoding and forwarding it on a different
subcarrier in the next time slot. Thus each message is transmitted on a pair of
subcarriers in two hops. It is assumed that the destination is capable of
combining the signals from the source and the relay pertaining to the same
message. The goal is to maximize the weighted sum rate of the system by jointly
optimizing subcarrier pairing and power allocation on each subcarrier in each
hop. The weighting of the rates is to take into account the fact that different
subcarriers may carry signals for different services. Both total and individual
power constraints for the source and the relay are investigated. For the
situations where the relay does not transmit on some subcarriers because doing
so does not improve the weighted sum rate, we further allow the source to
transmit new messages on these idle subcarriers. To the best of our knowledge,
such a joint optimization inclusive of the destination combining has not been
discussed in the literature. The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer
programming problem. It is then transformed to a convex optimization problem by
continuous relaxation, and solved in the dual domain. Based on the optimization
results, algorithms to achieve feasible solutions are also proposed. Simulation
results show that the proposed algorithms almost achieve the optimal weighted
sum rate, and outperform the existing methods in various channel conditions.

downlink beamforming problem where one multi-antenna base station broadcasts
data to many users. Each user is assigned multiple data streams and has
multiple antennas at its receiver. Efficient solutions to the joint
transmit-receive beamforming and power allocation problem based on iterative
methods are proposed. We adopt the group maximum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) filter bank (GSINR-FB) as our
beamformer which exploits receiver diversity through cooperation between the
data streams of a user. The data streams for each user are subject to an
average SINR constraint, which has many important applications in wireless
communication systems and serves as a good metric to measure the quality of
service (QoS). The GSINR-FB also optimizes the average SINR of its output.
Based on the GSINR-FB beamformer, we find an SINR balancing structure for
optimal power allocation which simplifies the complicated power allocation
problem to a linear one. Simulation results verify the superiority of the
proposed algorithms over previous works with approximately the same complexity.

$\mathbb C$. We define a notion of an (internal) action of $G$ of $A$ which is
functorially equivalent with a point in $\mathbb C$ over $G$, i.e. a split
extension in $\mathbb C$ with kernel $A$ and cokernel $G$. This notion and its
study are based on a preliminary investigation of cross-effects of functors in
a general categorical context. These also allow us to define higher categorical
commutators. We show that any proper subobject of an object $E$ (i.e., a kernel
of some map on $E$ in $\mathbb C$) admits a ""conjugation"" action of $E$,
generalizing the conjugation action of $E$ on itself defined by Bourn and
Janelidze. If $\mathbb C$ is semi-abelian, we show that for subobjects $X$, $Y$
of some object $A$, $X$ is proper in the supremum of $X$ and $Y$ if and only if
$X$ is stable under the restriction to $Y$ of the conjugation action of $A$ on
itself. This amounts to an elementary proof of Bourn and Janelidze's functorial
equivalence between points over $G$ in $\mathbb C$ and algebras over a certain
monad $\mathbb T_G$ on $\mathbb C$. The two axioms of such an algebra can be
replaced by three others, in terms of cross-effects, two of which generalize
the usual properties of an action of one group on another.

CBELSA/TAPS collaboration. The theoretical predictions of I^S and I^C, given
for altogether 18 angle dependent functions, are in good agreement with the
measurements. Also, the asymmetry dSigma/dcos(theta) evaluated here agrees with
the data. We show the importance of the Delta(1700)D33 resonance and its S-wave
decay into eta Delta(1232). The result can be considered as a further
confirmation of the dynamical nature of this resonance. At the highest
energies, deviations of the predictions from the data start to become
noticeable, which leaves room for additional processes and resonances such as a
Delta(1940)D33. We also point out how to further improve the calculation.

  theorem","This article has been withdrawn due to incorrect publication
  information. [arXiv admin]",,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known that the distribution of the prime numbers plays a central
role in number theory. It has been known, since Riemann's memoir in 1860, that
the distribution of prime numbers can be described by the zero-free region of
the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$. This function has infinitely many zeros
and a unique pole at $s = 1$. Those zeros at $s = -2, -4, -6, ...$ are known as
trivial zeros. The nontrivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$ are all located in the
so-called critical strip $0<\Re(s) <1$. Define $\Lambda(n) =\log p$ whenever $n
=p\sp{m}$ for a prime number $p$ and a positive integer $m$, and zero
otherwise. Let $x\ge 2$. The $\psi$-form of the prime number theorem is
$\psi(x) =\sum\sb{n \le x}\Lambda(n) =x +O\bigl(x\sp{1-H(x)} \log\sp{2}
x\big)$, where the sum runs through the set of positive integers and $H(x)$ is
a certain function of $x$ with $\tfrac{1}{2} \le H(x) < 1$. Tur\'an proved in
1950 that this $\psi$-form implies that there are no zeros of $\zeta(s)$ for
$\Re(s) > h(t)$, where $t=\Im(s)$, and $h(t)$ is a function connected to $H(x)$
in a certain way with $1/2 \le h(t) <1$ but both $H(x)$ and $h(t)$ are close to
1. We prove results similar to Tur\'an's where $\tfrac{1}{2} \le H(x)< 1$ and
$\tfrac{1}{2} \le h(t) <1$ in altered forms without any other restrictions. The
proof involves slightly revising and applying Tur\'an's power sum method.

relatively small, localized system in contact with an extended, chemically
complex environment. We demonstrate how to include the screening response of
the environment into highly accurate electronic structure calculation of the
localized system by means of an effective interaction between the electrons,
which contains only screening processes occurring in the environment. For the
common case of a localized system which constitutes an inhomogeneity in an
otherwise homogeneous system, such as a defect in a crystal, we show how matrix
elements of the environment-screened interaction can be calculated from
density-functional calculations of the homogeneous system only. We apply our
embedding theory to the calculation of excitation energies in crystalline
ethylene.

for binary state sequences and their implementations in terms of Boolean
threshold networks. Beside random sequences with biologically plausible
constraints, we analyze the cell cycle sequence of the species Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and the Boolean networks implementing it. Comparing with an
appropriate null model we do not find evidence that the yeast wildtype network

weakly correlates with the size of the basin of attraction, which has also been
considered a measure of robustness.
