AdS/CFT setup and discuss the time scales characterizing the interaction
between the Brownian particle and plasma constituents. In particular, the
mean-free-path time is related to the connected 4-point function of the random
force felt by the Brownian particle. By holographically computing the 4-point
function and regularizing the IR divergence appearing in the computation, we
write down a general formula for the mean-free-path time, and apply it to the
STU black hole which corresponds to plasma charged under three U(1) R-charges.
The result indicates that the Brownian particle collides with many plasma
constituents simultaneously.

is essential for the recovery process. This work introduces the concept of
blind compressed sensing, which avoids the need to know the sparsity basis in
both the sampling and the recovery process. We suggest three possible
constraints on the sparsity basis that can be added to the problem in order to
make its solution unique. For each constraint we prove conditions for
uniqueness, and suggest a simple method to retrieve the solution. Under the

demonstrate through simulations that without knowing the sparsity basis our
methods can achieve results similar to those of standard compressed sensing,
which relay on prior knowledge of the sparsity basis. This offers a general
sampling and reconstruction system that fits all sparse signals, regardless of

can transmit time-varying signals. To this end, we must understand both the
noise characteristics and the amplification properties of networks. In this
manuscript, we use information theory to study how reliably signalling cascades
employing autoregulation and feedback can transmit time-varying signals. We
calculate the frequency-dependence of the gain-to-noise ratio, which reflects
how reliably a network transmits signals at different frequencies. We find that
the gain-to-noise ratio may differ qualitatively from the power spectrum of the
output, showing that the latter does not directly reflect signaling
performance. Moreover, we find that auto-activation and auto-repression
increase and decrease the gain-to-noise ratio for all of frequencies,
respectively. Positive feedback specifically enhances information transmission
at low frequencies, while negative feedback increases signal fidelity at high
frequencies. Our analysis not only elucidates the role of autoregulation and
feedback in naturally-occurring biological networks, but also reveals design
principles that can be used for the reliable transmission of time-varying
signals in synthetic gene circuits.

similar structures, the dynamics of the hairpin vortices is entwined with that
of the counter-rotating pair of streamwise vortices, which we found to be
generated in the bottom part of the near wake (these are usually referred to as
base vortices). In particular, once the hairpin structure is released, the base
vortices attach to it, forming its legs, so these are streamwise, and not
spanwise as previously observed in unconfined wakes or behind cylinders of
lower aspect ratios. We also single out a trail of Omega-shaped vortices,
generated between successive hairpin vortices through a mechanism that is
analogous to that active in near-wall turbulence. Finally, we show how the
dynamics of the structures we identified determine the evolution of the drag
coefficients and Strouhal numbers when the Reynolds number varies.

CO5BOLD model, and compute the departures from local thermodynamical
equilibrium by using the Kiel code. We measure equivalent widths of atomic CI
lines on high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio solar atlases. Deviations
from local thermodynamic equilibrium are computed in 1D with the Kiel code. Our
recommended value for the solar carbon abundance, relies on 98 independent
measurements of observed lines and is A(C)=8.50+-0.06, the quoted error is the
sum of statistical and systematic error. Combined with our recent results for
the solar oxygen and nitrogen abundances this implies a solar metallicity of
Z=0.0154 and Z/X=0.0211. Our analysis implies a solar carbon abundance which is
about 0.1 dex higher than what was found in previous analysis based on
different 3D hydrodynamical computations. The difference is partly driven by
our equivalent width measurements (we measure, on average, larger equivalent
widths with respect to the other work based on a 3D model), in part it is
likely due to the different properties of the hydrodynamical simulations and
the spectrum synthesis code. The solar metallicity we obtain from the CO5BOLD
analyses is in slightly better agreement with the constraints of
helioseismology than the previous 3D abundance results. (Abridged)

(and positrons) in the internal shocks, and find that the photospheric emission
may correspond to the traditional (Band) component at <~1 MeV and the UP
emission to the high-energy emission observed by Fermi/LAT for some GRBs at >~
10 MeV. The two components can be separate in the spectrum in some cases or can
mimic a smooth broad Band spectrum in other cases. We apply our formulation to
the well-studied long and short LAT GRBs, GRB 080916C, GRB 090902B, and GRB
090510, and typically find reasonable parameters for fitting the time-binned

delays of the high-energy emission with respect to the MeV emission which are
large compared to the variability times are unlikely to be due to simple
kinematic effects of a non-evolving jet. These delays may be attributed to the
temporal evolution of the physical parameters of the jet, and thus the delay
timescales could provide a potential tool for investigating the structures of
GRB jets themselves and their progenitors. The difference of the delay
timescales of long and short GRBs inferred from the Fermi data might be due to
the differences in the progenitors of long and short GRBs. Some other

inflationary phase space based on the dynamical behavior of the scalar field.
This allows us to construct the flow of trajectories, finding that trajectories
generically decay towards the inflationary solution at a steeper angle for
non-canonical kinetic terms, in comparison to canonical kinetic terms, so that
a larger fraction of the initial-conditions space leads to inflation. Thus,
non-canonical kinetic terms can be important for removing the initial

single-band variability by a power-law model for the light-curve structure
function, with amplitude A and power-law index gamma. We show that quasars can
be efficiently separated from other non-variable and variable sources by the
location of the individual sources in the A-gamma plane. We use ~60 epochs of
imaging data, taken over ~5 years, from the SDSS stripe 82 (S82) survey, where
extensive spectroscopy provides a reference sample of quasars, to demonstrate
the power of variability as a quasar classifier in multi-epoch surveys. For
UV-excess selected objects, variability performs just as well as the standard
SDSS color selection, identifying quasars with a completeness of 90% and a
purity of 95%. In the redshift range 2.5<z<3, where color selection is known to
be problematic, variability can select quasars with a completeness of 90% and a
purity of 96%. This is a factor of 5-10 times more pure than existing
color-selection of quasars in this redshift range. Selecting objects from a
broad griz color box without u-band information, variability selection in S82
can afford completeness and purity of 92%, despite a factor of 30 more
contaminants than quasars in the color-selected feeder sample. This confirms
that the fraction of quasars hidden in the 'stellar locus' of color-space is
small. To test variability selection in the context of Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) we
created mock PS1 data by down-sampling the S82 data to just 6 epochs over 3
years. Even with this much sparser time sampling, variability is an
encouragingly efficient classifier. For instance, a 92% pure and 44% complete
quasar candidate sample is attainable from the above $griz$-selected catalog.

receivers, is an important aspect of sensor and tactical networks and has
several distinctive traits as opposed to more commonly studied unicast
networks. Specially, these include (i) identical packets must be delivered
successfully to several nodes, (ii) outage at any receiver requires the packet
to be retransmitted at least to that receiver, and (iii) the multicast rate is
dominated by the receiver with the weakest link in order to minimize outage and
retransmission. A first contribution of this paper is the development of a
tractable multicast model and throughput metric that captures each of these key
traits in a multicast wireless network. We utilize a Poisson cluster process
(PCP) consisting of a distinct Poisson point process (PPP) for the transmitters
and receivers, and then define the multicast transmission capacity (MTC) as the
maximum achievable multicast rate per transmission attempt times the maximum
intensity of multicast clusters under decoding delay and multicast outage
constraints. A multicast cluster is a contiguous area over which a packet is
multicasted, and to reduce outage it can be tessellated into $v$ smaller
regions of multicast. The second contribution of the paper is the analysis of
several key aspects of this model, for which we develop the following main
result. Assuming $\tau/v$ transmission attempts are allowed for each
tessellated region in a multicast cluster, we show that the MTC is $\Theta(\rho
k^{x}\log(k)v^{y})$ where $\rho$, $x$ and $y$ are functions of $\tau$ and $v$
depending on the network size and intensity, and $k$ is the average number of
the intended receivers in a cluster. We derive $\{\rho, x, y\}$ for a number of
regimes of interest, and also show that an appropriate number of
retransmissions can significantly enhance the MTC.

radical departure from the classical Lorentz-Lorenz theory of the local field
(LF), which assumes that the LF is virtually uniform on this scale. We
demonstrate that the strata and patterns in the 2D lattices may be described as
an interference of plane-wave locsitons, build an analytic model for such
unbounded locsitons, and derive and analyze dispersion relations for the
locsitons in an equilateral triangular lattice. We draw useful analogies
between one-dimensional and 2D locsitons, but also show that the 2D case
enables locsitons with the most diverse and unusual properties. Using the
nearest-neighbor approximation, we find the locsiton frequency band for
different mutual orientations of the lattice and the incident field. We
demonstrate a formation of distinct vector locsiton patterns consisting of
multiple vortices in the LF distribution and suggest a way to design finite 2D
lattices that exhibit such patterns at certain frequencies. We illustrate the
role of lattice defects in supporting localized locsitons and also demonstrate
the existence of ""magic shapes"", for which the LF suppression at the exact
atomic resonance is cancelled.

  Somerville, T. Storchi-Bergmann, eds",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Observational data show that the correlation between supermassive black holes
(MBH) and galaxy bulge (Mbulge) masses follows a nearly linear trend, and that
the correlation is strongest with the bulge rather than the total stellar mass
(Mgal). With increasing redshift, the ratio Gamma=MBH/Mbulge relative to z=0
also seems to be larger for MBH >~ 10^{8.5} Msol. This study looks more closely
at statistics to better understand the creation and observations of the
MBH-Mbulge correlation. It is possible to show that if galaxy merging
statistics can drive the correlation, minor mergers are responsible for causing
a *convergence to linearity* most evident at high masses, whereas major mergers
have a central limit convergence that more strongly *reduces the scatter*. This
statistical reasoning is agnostic about galaxy morphology. Therefore, combining
statistical prediction (more major mergers ==> tighter correlation) with
observations (bulges = tightest correlation), would lead one to conclude that
more major mergers (throughout an entire merger tree, not just the primary
branch) give rise to more prominent bulges. With regard to controversial
findings that Gamma increases with redshift, this study shows why the
luminosity function (LF) bias argument, taken correctly at face value,
strengthens rather than weakens the results. However, correcting for LF bias is
unwarranted because the BH mass scale for quasars is bootstrapped to the
MBH-Sigma* correlation in normal galaxies at z=0, and quasar-quasar comparisons
are internally consistent. In Monte-Carlo simulations, high Gamma objects are
""under-merged"" galaxies that take longer to converge to linearity via minor
mergers. Another evidence that the galaxies are undermassive at z >~ 2 for
their MBH is that the quasar hosts are very compact for their expected mass.

the EoR is related to many fundamental questions in cosmology, galaxy

that gravity is not fundamental but emergent, and in particular, as Verlinde
suggested, gravity is probably an entropic force. In this paper, we will argue
that the idea of gravity as an entropic force is debatable. It is shown that
there is no convincing analogy between gravity and entropic force in Verlinde's
example. Neither holographic screen nor test particle satisfies all
requirements for the existence of entropic force in a thermodynamics system.
Furthermore, we show that the entropy increase of the screen is not caused by
its statistical tendency to increase entropy as required by the existence of
entropic force, but in fact caused by gravity. Therefore, Verlinde's argument
for the entropic origin of gravity is problematic. In addition, we argue that
the existence of a minimum size of spacetime, together with the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle in quantum theory, may imply the fundamental existence of
gravity as a geometric property of spacetime. This may provide a further
support for the conclusion that gravity is not an entropic force.

We demonstrate with high mass and force resolution collisionless N-body
simulations that long-lived secondary bars can form spontaneously without
requiring gas, contrary to previous claims. We find that secondary bars rotate
faster than primary ones. The rotation is not rigid: the secondary bars
pulsate, with their amplitude and pattern speed oscillating as they rotate
through the primary bars. This self-consistent study supports previous work
based on orbital analysis in the potential of two rigidly rotating bars. We
also characterize the density and kinematics of the N-body simulations of the
double-barred galaxies, compare with observations to achieve a better
understanding of such galaxies. The pulsating nature of secondary bars may have
important implications for understanding the central region of double-barred

These mathematical results can be useful for tunnel drilling as it approaches a
vertical cold water bearing structure that induces a thermal anomaly in the
surrounding massif. During the tunnel drilling, by monitoring this anomaly
along the tunnel axis one can quantify the flow rate in the discontinuity ahead
before intersecting the fracture. The cases of the Simplon, Mont Blanc and
Gotthard tunnels (Alps) are handled with this approach which shows very good
agreement between observed temperatures and the theoretical trend. The flow
rates before drilling of the tunnel predicted with the theoretical solution are
