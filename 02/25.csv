Experimental data include deep-inelastic scattering with the combined HERA-I
dataset, fixed target Drell-Yan production, collider weak boson production and
inclusive jet production. Next-to-leading order QCD is used throughout without
resorting to K-factors. We present and utilize an improved fast algorithm for
the solution of evolution equations and the computation of general hadronic
processes. We introduce improved techniques for the training of the neural
networks which are used as parton parametrization, and we use a novel approach
for the proper treatment of normalization uncertainties. We assess
quantitatively the impact of individual datasets on PDFs. We find very good
consistency of all datasets with each other and with NLO QCD, with no evidence
of tension between datasets. Some PDF combinations relevant for LHC observables
turn out to be determined rather more accurately than in any other parton fit.

isotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is in good agreement with a single power
law, and is not showing any signature of a dominant contribution from dark
matter sources in the energy range from 20 to 100 GeV. We use the absolute size
and spectral shape of this measured flux to derive cross section limits on
three types of generic dark matter candidates: annihilating into quarks,
charged leptons and monochromatic photons. Predicted gamma-ray fluxes from
annihilating dark matter are strongly affected by the underlying distribution
of dark matter, and by using different available results of matter structure
formation we assess these uncertainties. We also quantify how the dark matter
constraints depend on the assumed conventional backgrounds and on the
Universe's transparency to high-energy gamma-rays. In reasonable background and
dark matter structure scenarios (but not in all scenarios we consider) it is
possible to exclude models proposed to explain the excess of electrons and
positrons measured by the Fermi-LAT and PAMELA experiments. Derived limits also
start to probe cross sections expected from thermally produced relics (e.g. in
minimal supersymmetry models) annihilating predominantly into quarks. For the
monochromatic gamma-ray signature, the current measurement constrains only dark
matter scenarios with very strong signals.

equations. Heterogeneity among individual cells is accounted for by differences
in parameter values and initial conditions. Hereby, parameter values and
initial conditions are subject to a distribution function which is part of the
model specification. Based on the single cell model and the considered
parameter distribution, a partial differential equation model describing the
distribution of cells in the state and in the output space is derived.

consider experimental data as obtained from flow cytometric analysis. From
these noise-corrupted data a density-based statistical data model is derived.
Using this data model the parameter distribution within the cell population is
computed using convex optimization techniques.

specification ""every request is eventually followed by an acknowledgment"" is
satisfied vacuously by a system that never generates any requests. Vacuous
satisfaction misleads users of model-checking into thinking that a system is
correct.
  There are several existing definitions of vacuity. Originally, Beer et al.
formalized vacuity as insensitivity to syntactic perturbation. However, this
definition is only reasonable for vacuity in a single occurrence. Armoni et al.
argued that vacuity must be robust -- not affected by semantically invariant
changes, such as extending a model with additional atomic propositions. They
show that syntactic vacuity is not robust for LTL, and propose an alternative
definition -- trace vacuity.
  In this article, we continue this line of research. We show that trace
vacuity is not robust for branching time logic. We refine it to apply uniformly
to linear and branching time logic and to not suffer from the common pitfalls
of prior definitions. Our new definition -- bisimulation vacuity -- is a proper
non-trivial extension of both syntactic and trace vacuity. We discuss the
complexity of detecting bisimulation vacuity, and give efficient algorithms to

can be constrained through IR-optical emission, originating in the accretion
disks. For the first time, we can evaluate jet and accretion powers in units of
the Eddington luminosity for a large number of blazars. Firsts results are
intriguing. Blazar jets have powers comparable to, and often larger than the
luminosity produced by their accretion disk. Blazar jets are produced at all
accretion rates (in Eddington units), and their appearance depends if the
accretion regime is radiatively efficient or not. The jet power is dominated by
the bulk motion of matter, not by the Poynting flux, at least in the jet region

intermediate between the expected values for cold and warm neutral media. This
suggests that the HI absorption originates from a mixture of different phases.

Hya, a nearby T Tauri star. The unusual spectral energy distribution of the
source, that of a transition object, indicates that the circumstellar disk in
the system has experienced significant evolution, possibly as a result of
planet formation. The spectrum we measure is strikingly different from that of
other classical T Tauri stars reported in the literature, displaying no strong
emission features of water, acetylene, or HCN. The difference indicates that
the inner planet formation region (within 5 AU) of the gaseous disk has evolved
physically and/or chemically away from the classical T Tauri norm.
Nevertheless, TW Hya does show a rich spectrum of emission features of atoms
(HI, [NeII], and [NeIII]) and molecules (H2, OH, CO2, HCO+, and possibly CH3),
some of which are also detected in classical T Tauri spectra. The properties of
the neon emission are consistent with an origin for the emission in a disk
irradiated by X-rays (with a possible role for additional irradiation by
stellar EUV). The OH emission we detect, which also likely originates in the
disk, is hot, arising from energy levels up to 23,000 K above ground, and may
be produced by the UV photodissociation of water. The HI emission is
surprisingly strong, with relative strengths that are consistent with case B
recombination. While the absence of strong molecular emission in the 10-20
micron region may indicate that the inner region of the gaseous disk has been
partly cleared by an orbiting giant planet, chemical and/or excitation effects
may be responsible instead. We discuss these issues and how our results bear on
our understanding of the evolutionary state of the TW Hya disk.

spectrograph to target candidate relatively metal-rich damped Lyman-alpha
absorbers (DLAs). The spectral coverage of X-shooter allows us to search for
not only Lyman-alpha emission, but also rest-frame optical emission lines. We
have chosen DLAs where the strongest rest-frame optical lines ([OII], [OIII],
Hbeta and Halpha) fall in the NIR atmospheric transmission bands. In this first
paper resulting from the survey, we report on the discovery of the galaxy
counterpart of the z_abs = 2.354 DLA towards the z=2.926 quasar Q2222$-0946.
This DLA is amongst the most metal-rich z>2 DLAs studied so far at comparable
redshifts and there is evidence for substantial depletion of refractory
elements onto dust grains. We measure metallicities from ZnII, SiII, NiII, MnII
and FeII of -0.46+/-0.07, -0.51+/-0.06, -0.85+/-0.06, -1.23+/-0.06, and
-0.99+/-0.06, respectively. The galaxy is detected in the Lyman-alpha, [OIII]
lambda4959,5007 Halpha emission lines at an impact parameter of about 0.8
arcsec (6 kpc at z_abs = 2.354). We infer a star-formation rate of 10 M_sun
yr^-1, which is a lower limit due to the possibility of slit-loss. Compared to
the recently determined Halpha luminosity function for z=2.2 galaxies the
DLA-galaxy counterpart has a luminosity of L~0.1L^*_Halpha. The emission-line
ratios are 4.0 (Lyalpha/Halpha) and 1.2 ([OIII]/Halpha). The Lyalpha line shows
clear evidence for resonant scattering effects, namely an asymmetric,
redshifted (relative to the systemic redshift) component and a much weaker
blueshifted component. The fact that the blueshifted component is relatively
weak indicates the presence of a galactic wind. The properties of the galaxy
counterpart of this DLA is consistent with the prediction that metal-rich DLAs
are associated with the most luminous of the DLA-galaxy counterparts.

supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking which we call Gaugino Anomaly Mediation, or
inoAMSB. This is suggested by recent work on the phenomenology of flux
compactified type IIB string theory. The essential features of this scenario
are that the gaugino masses are of the anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (AMSB)
form, while scalar and trilinear soft SUSY breaking terms are highly
suppressed. Renormalization group effects yield an allowable sparticle mass
spectrum, while at the same time avoiding charged LSPs; the latter are common
in models with negligible soft scalar masses, such as no-scale or gaugino
mediation models. Since scalar and trilinear soft terms are highly suppressed,
the SUSY induced flavor and CP-violating processes are also suppressed. The
lightest SUSY particle is the neutral wino, while the heaviest is the gluino.
In this model, there should be a strong multi-jet +etmiss signal from squark
pair production at the LHC. We find a 100 fb^{-1} reach of LHC out to
m_{3/2}\sim 118 TeV, corresponding to a gluino mass of \sim 2.6 TeV. A double
mass edge from the opposite-sign/same flavor dilepton invariant mass
distribution should be visible at LHC; this, along with the presence of short--
but visible-- highly ionizing tracks from quasi-stable charginos, should
provide a smoking gun signature for inoAMSB.

simply-connected but possibly multi-component bipartite graph. A trading
session on a fixed graph consists of a sequence of exchanges between connected
buyers and sellers until no more exchanges are possible. We deem a trading
session ""feasible"" if all of the buyers satisfy their respective demands. If
all trading sessions are feasible the graph is deemed ""successful"", otherwise
the feasibility of a trading session depends on the order of the sequence of
exchanges. We demonstrate that topology is important for the success of trading
sessions on graphs. In particular, for the case that supply equals demand for
each component of the graph, we prove that the graph is successful if and only
if the graph consists of components each of which are complete bipartite. For
the case that supply exceeds demand, we prove that the other topologies also
can be made successful but with finite reserve (i.e., excess supply)
requirements that may grow proportional to the number of buyers. Finally, with
computations for a small instance of the model, we provide an example of the
wide range of performance in which only the connectivity varies. These results
taken together place limits on the improvements in performance that can be
expected from proposals to increase the connectivity of sparse exchange

balances the radiative cooling. The low-$\beta$ solutions extend to high mass

holography provides a remarkably accurate first approximation for the spectra

bound-state Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD leads to relativistic
light-front wave equations in terms of an invariant impact variable $\zeta$
which measures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the
hadron at equal light-front time. These equations of motion in physical
space-time are equivalent to the equations of motion which describe the
propagation of spin-$J$ modes in anti--de Sitter (AdS) space. The eigenvalues
give the hadronic spectrum, and the eigenmodes represent the probability
distributions of the hadronic constituents at a given scale. A positive-sign
confining dilaton background modifying AdS space gives a very good account of
meson and baryon spectroscopy and form factors. The light-front holographic
mapping of this model also leads to a non-perturbative effective coupling
$\alpha_s^{AdS}(Q^2)$ which agrees with the effective charge defined by the
Bjorken sum rule and lattice simulations. It displays a transition from
perturbative to nonperturbative conformal regimes at a momentum scale $ \sim 1$

characteristics of the full $\beta$-function of QCD, thus giving further

the limits of the continuous approximation underlying differential equations.

us to formulate new hypotheses on the system behaviour, such as the presence of
self-sustained oscillations in single cells under constant light conditions.
  We investigate how to model the timing of dawn and dusk in the context of
model-checking, which we use to compute how the probability distributions of
key biochemical species change over time. These show that the relative
variation in expression level is smallest at the time of peak expression,
making peak time an optimal experimental phase marker. Building on these
analyses, we use approaches from evolutionary systems biology to investigate
how changes in the rate of mRNA degradation impacts the phase of a key protein
likely to affect fitness. We explore how robust this circadian clock is towards
such potential mutational changes in its underlying biochemistry. Our work
shows that multiple approaches lead to a more complete understanding of the

  Methods: In the data reduction we take particular care to minimise systematic
errors in the sky subtraction, which are evident in the published spectrum, and
compromise the analysis. The final combined spectrum has a higher S/N than the
previously published spectrum by a factor of 1.3.
  Results: We find a single significant absorption line redward of the Ly-alpha
continuum break, which we identify with the SII+SiII blend (rest wavelength of
0.1260 micron), at z=6.733. The sharp spectral break at Ly-alpha implies a
comparatively low total column density of neutral hydrogen along the line of
sight, log [N(HI)/cm^-2] < 20. We model the absorption with a host-galaxy DLA,
surrounded by an ionised region of unknown size r, within the IGM of neutral
fraction, x(HI). Despite knowing the source redshift, and the improved S/N of
the spectrum, when fitting only over wavelengths redward of Ly-alpha, no useful
constraints on x(HI) can be obtained. We consider the possibility of including
the ionised region, blueward of Ly-alpha, in constraining the fit. For the
optimistic assumption that the ionised region is transparent, tau_{GP} << 1, we
find that the region is of small size r < 2 proper Mpc, and we obtain an upper
limit to the neutral fraction of the IGM at z=6.7 of x(HI) < 0.73.

of hadron physics; e.g., a hadron is defined by its flavor content and that is
a valence-quark property. Furthermore, its accurate parametrization is crucial
to the provision of reliable input for large collider experiments. We focus on
experimental extractions of distribution functions via electron and muon
inelastic scattering, and from Drell-Yan interactions; and on theoretical
treatments that emphasize an explanation of the distribution functions,
providing an overview of major contemporary approaches and issues.
Valence-quark physics is a compelling subject, which probes at the heart of our
understanding of the Standard Model. There are numerous outstanding and
unresolved challenges, which experiment and theory must confront. In connection
with experiment, we explain that an upgraded Jefferson Lab facility is
well-suited to provide new data on the nucleon, while a future electron ion
collider could provide essential new data for the mesons. There is also great
potential in using Drell-Yan interactions, at FNAL, J-PARC and GSI, to push
into the large-x domain for both mesons and nucleons. We argue furthermore that
explanation, in contrast to modeling and parametrization, requires a widespread
acceptance of the need to adapt theory: to the lessons learnt already from the
methods of nonperturbative quantum field theory; and a fuller exploitation of
those methods.

libraries built on top of lock-free (fence-free) synchronization mechanisms. In
this paper we present a further evolution of FastFlow enabling programmers to
offload part of their workload on a dynamically created software accelerator

pre-existing sequential code. We emphasize in particular the effective

We then work on the system with a magnetic field in the Faraday configuration,
where the different values of the valley splitting are discussed. In the case
of large valley splitting, we find the transition rates can be effectively
manipulated by varying the external magnetic field and the dot size.
  The intriguing features of the singlet-triplet relaxation in the vicinity of
the anticrossing point are analyzed. In the case of small valley splitting, we
find that the transition rates are much smaller than those in the case of large

Problem}. The TEP was introduced in earlier work as a simple candidate for the
(*very*) long term goal of separating L and LogDCFL. The input to the problem
is a rooted, balanced binary tree of height h, whose internal nodes are labeled
with binary functions on [k] = {1,...,k} (each given simply as a list of k^2
elements of [k]), and whose leaves are labeled with elements of [k]. Each node
obtains a value in [k] equal to its binary function applied to the values of
its children, and the output is the value of the root. The first restricted
computation model, called Fractional Pebbling, is a generalization of the
black/white pebbling game on graphs, and arises in a natural way from the
search for good upper bounds on the size of nondeterministic branching programs
(BPs) solving the TEP - for any fixed h, if the binary tree of height h has
fractional pebbling cost at most p, then there are nondeterministic BPs of size
O(k^p) solving the height h TEP. We prove a lower bound on the fractional
pebbling cost of d-ary trees that is tight to within an additive constant for
each fixed d. The second restricted computation model we study is a semantic
restriction on (non)deterministic BPs solving the TEP - Thrifty BPs.
Deterministic (resp. nondeterministic) thrifty BPs suffice to implement the
best known algorithms for the TEP, based on black (resp. fractional) pebbling.
In earlier work, for each fixed h a lower bound on the size of deterministic
thrifty BPs was proved that is tight for sufficiently large k. We give an
alternative proof that achieves the same bound for all k. We show the same
bound still holds in a less-restricted model, and also that gradually weaker
lower bounds can be obtained for gradually weaker restrictions on the model.

suggested the presence of a neutron star or black-hole binary companion, a
follow-up study concluded that the spectrum was better understood as a
combination of two white dwarfs. Here we present optical spectroscopy and
ultraviolet fluxes which directly reveal the presence of the second white dwarf
in the system. SDSSJ1257+5428's spectrum is a composite, dominated by the
narrow-lined spectrum from a cool, low gravity white dwarf (Teff ~6300K, log g
= 5 to 6.6) with broad wings from a hotter, high-mass white dwarf companion
(11,000 to 14,000K; ~ 1Msun). The high-mass white dwarf has unusual line
profiles which lack the narrow central core to Halpha that is usually seen in
white dwarfs. This is consistent with rapid rotation with v sin i = 500 to
1750km/s, although other broadening mechanisms such as magnetic fields,
pulsations or a helium-rich atmosphere could also be contributory factors. The
cool component is a puzzle since no evolutionary model matches its combination
of low gravity and temperature. Within the constraints set by our data,
SDSSJ1257+5428 could have a total mass greater than the Chandrasekhar limit and
thus be a potential Type Ia supernova progenitor. However, SDSSJ1257+5428's
unusually low mass ratio q ~ 0.2 suggests that it is more likely that it will
evolve into an accreting double white dwarf (AM CVn star).

Object Spectrograph Spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei and Quasars is used to
study the redward asymmetry in CIV broad emission lines (BELs). It is concluded
that there is a highly significant correlation between the spectral index from
10 GHz to 1350 $\AA$ and the amount of excess luminosity in the red wing of the
CIV BEL ($>99.9999%$ significance level for the full sample and the radio loud
subsample independently, but no correlation is found for the radio quiet
subsample). This is interpreted as a correlation between radio core dominance
and the strength of the CIV redward asymmetry. The data implies that within the
quasar environment there is BEL gas with moderately blueshifted emission
associated with the purely radio quiet quasar phenomenon (the accretion disk)
and the radio jet emission mechanism is associated with a redward BEL component
that is most prominent for lines of sight along the jet axis. Thus, radio quiet
quasars have CIV BELs that tend to show blueshifted excess and radio loud
quasars show either a red or blue excess with the tendency for a dominant red
excess increasing as the line of sight approaches the jet axis.

be used as cosmological probes. However, there are some discrepancies between
cluster masses determined based on gravitational lensing, and X-ray
observations assuming strict hydrostatic equilibirium (i.e., the equilibrium
gas pressure is provided entirely by thermal pressure). Cosmological
simulations suggest that turbulent gas motions remaining from hierarchical
structure formation may provide a significant contribution to the equilibrium
pressure in clusters. We analyze a sample of massive clusters of galaxies drawn
from high resolution cosmological simulations, and find a significant
contribution (20%-45%) from non-thermal pressure near the center of relaxed
clusters, and, in accord with previous studies, a minimum contribution at about
0.1 Rvir, growing to about 30%-45% at the virial radius, Rvir. Our results
strongly suggest that relaxed clusters should have significant non-thermal
support in their core region. As an example, we test the validity of strict
hydrostatic equilibirium in the well-studied massive galaxy cluster Abell 1689
using the latest high resolution gravitational lensing and X-ray observations.
We find a contribution of about 40% from non-thermal pressure within the core
region of A1689, suggesting an alternate explanation for the mass discrepancy:
the strict hydrostatic equilibirium is not valid in this region.

vector of $\sigma$ can be computed from a crossing point between minimal
geometrical object, in which all separable states reside in the presence of
Bloch vectors, and a straight line, which connects the point corresponding to

well to explain WMAP observations appropriately, a mechanism of supersymmetry
breaking (SSB) and Gravitino Production just after the end of inflation are
investigated. Supersymmetry is broken mainly by F-term of the inflaton
superfield and the Goldstino is identified to be inflatino in this model, which
fact is shown numerically. By using the canonically normalized and diagonalized
scalars, the decay rates of these fields are calculated, for both the $T$ and
$Y$ into gravitinos. Non-thermal production of gravitinos is not generated from
the inflaton (dilaton), since the inflaton mass is lighter than gravitino, but
they are produced by the decay of modular field $T$ and scalar field $Y$.
Because the reheating temperature $T_R$ is about order $\sim O(10^{10})$ GeV
and the mass of gravitino is $3.16 \times 10^{12}$ GeV, it is not reproduced
after the reheating of the universe. The gravitinos are produced almost
instantly just after the end of inflation through $Y$ and $T$, not from
inflaton. Because the decay time appears very rapid, gravitinos disappear
before the BBN stage of the universe. The effects of the lightest
supersymmetric particles (LSP) produced by gravitinos may be important to
investigate more carefully, if the LSP's are the candidate of dark matter.

suggested that it was a dynamically stable, primordial body, it has been
assumed this applies to both that object, and its more recently discovered
brethren. However, it seems that things are no longer so clear cut. In this
work, we present the results of detailed dynamical simulations of the orbital
behaviour of 2001 QR322. Using an ephemeris for the object that has
significantly improved since earlier works, we follow the evolution of 19683
test particles, placed on orbits within the observational error ellipse of 2001
QR322's orbit, for a period of 1 Gyr. We find that majority of these ""clones""
of 2001 QR322 are dynamically unstable, exhibiting a near-exponential decay
from both the Neptunian Trojan cloud (decay halflife ~550 Myr) and the Solar
system (decay halflife ~590 Myr). The stability of the object within Neptune's
Trojan cloud is found to be strongly dependent on the initial semi-major axis
used, with those objects located at semimajor axis equal or greater than 30.30
AU being significantly less stable than those interior to this value, as a
result of their having initial libration amplitudes very close to a critical
threshold dividing regular and irregular motion, located at ~70-75 deg (full
extent of angular motion). This result suggests that, if 2001 QR322 is a
primordial Neptunian Trojan, it must be a representative of a population that
was once significantly larger than that we see today, and adds weight to the
idea that the Neptune Trojans may represent a significant source of objects
moving on unstable orbits between the giant planets (the Centaurs).

parallel magnetic field is solved. The jet boundary becomes, under certain
conditions, unstable relative to magnetosonic oscillations (Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability) in the presence of a shear flow at the jet boundary. Because of
its internal inhomogeneity the plasma jet has resonance surfaces, where
conversion takes place between various modes of plasma MHD oscillations.
Propagating in inhomogeneous plasma, fast magnetosonic waves drive the Alfven
and slow magnetosonic oscillations, tightly localized across the magnetic
shells, on the resonance surfaces. MHD oscillation energy is absorbed in the
neighbourhood of these resonance surfaces. The resonance surfaces disappear for
the eigen-modes of slow magnetosonic waves propagating in the jet waveguide.
The stability of the plasma MHD flow is determined by competition between the
mechanisms of shear flow instability on the boundary and wave energy
dissipation because of resonant MHD-mode coupling. The problem is solved
analytically, in the WKB approximation, for the plasma jet with a boundary in
the form of a tangential discontinuity over the radial coordinate. The
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability develops if plasma flow velocity in the jet
exceeds the maximum Alfven speed at the boundary. The stability of the plasma
jet with a smooth boundary layer is investigated numerically for the basic
modes of MHD oscillations, to which the WKB approximation is inapplicable. A
new ""global"" unstable mode of MHD oscillations has been discovered which,
unlike the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, exists for any, however weak, plasma
flow velocities.

investigate here the potential of this approach for the M dwarf GJ 1214 that
hosts a transiting super-Earth. For this system, we infer the transit

we address both the cases for fully coplanar and for non-coplanar orbits, with
three different choices of inclinations distribution for the non-coplanar case.
GJ 1214 reveals to be a very promising target for the considered approach.
Because of its small size, a ground-based photometric monitoring of this star
could detect the transit of a habitable planet as small as the Earth, while a
space-based monitoring could detect any transiting habitable planet down to the
size of Mars. The mass measurement of such a small planet would be out of reach
for current facilities, but we emphasize that a planet mass would not be needed
to confirm the planetary nature of the transiting object. Furthermore, the
radius measurement combined with theoretical arguments would help us to

the luminous satellite as a local positive surface density correction to the

gamma-ray surveys, they would appear to be in contrast with results reported
from an optically selected sample. This apparent difference can be explained as
being due to a selection bias caused by the reduction in high energy flux in
Compton thick objects rendering them invisible at our sensitivity limit. Taking
this into account we estimate that the fraction of highly absorbed sources is
actually in close agreement with the optically selected sample. Furthermore we
show that the measured fraction of absorbed sources in our sample decreases
from 80% to ~20-30% as a function of redshift with all Compton thick AGN having
z<0.015. We conclude that in the low redshift bin we are seeing almost the
entire AGN population, from unabsorbed to at least mildly Compton thick
objects, while in the total sample we lose the heavily absorbed 'counterparts'
of distant and therefore dim sources with little or no absorption. Taking
therefore this low z bin as the only one able to provide the 'true'

costly. The MC+ has two elements: a minimax concave penalty (MCP) and a
penalized linear unbiased selection (PLUS) algorithm. The MCP provides the
convexity of the penalized loss in sparse regions to the greatest extent given
certain thresholds for variable selection and unbiasedness. The PLUS computes
multiple exact local minimizers of a possibly nonconvex penalized loss function
in a certain main branch of the graph of critical points of the penalized loss.
Its output is a continuous piecewise linear path encompassing from the origin
for infinite penalty to a least squares solution for zero penalty. We prove
that at a universal penalty level, the MC+ has high probability of matching the
signs of the unknowns, and thus correct selection, without assuming the strong
irrepresentable condition required by the LASSO. This selection consistency
applies to the case of $p\gg n$, and is proved to hold for exactly the MC+
solution among possibly many local minimizers. We prove that the MC+ attains
certain minimax convergence rates in probability for the estimation of
regression coefficients in $\ell_r$ balls. We use the SURE method to derive
degrees of freedom and $C_p$-type risk estimates for general penalized LSE,
including the LASSO and MC+ estimators, and prove their unbiasedness. Based on
the estimated degrees of freedom, we propose an estimator of the noise level
for proper choice of the penalty level.

advantage that they can describe the dynamics of the Universe with a single
matter component providing an explanation for structure formation and cosmic
acceleration. A crucial feature of the class of UDM models we use in this work
is characterised by a parameter, c_inf (in units of the speed of light c=1),
that is the value of the sound speed at late times, and on which structure
formation depends. We demonstrate that the properties of the DM-like behaviour
of the scalar field can be estimated with very high precision with large-scale,

constrains c_inf, and we find minimal errors 0.00003, for the fiducial value
c_inf=0.001, and 0.000026, for c_inf=0.012. Moreover, we compute the Bayesian
evidence for UDM models over the LCDM model as a function of c_inf. For this
purpose, we can consider the LCDM model as a UDM model with c_inf=0. We find
that the expected evidence clearly shows that the survey data would
unquestionably favour UDM models over the LCDM model, for the values
c_inf>0.001.

instabilities that develop between a collisionless plasma and beams of charged
particles. However, even on contemporary supercomputers, it is not always
possible to resolve the ion dynamics in more than one spatial dimension with
such simulations. The ion mass is thus reduced below 1836 electron masses,
which can affect the plasma dynamics during the initial exponential growth
phase of the instability and during the subsequent nonlinear saturation. The
goal of this article is to assess how far the electron to ion mass ratio can be
increased, without changing qualitatively the physics. It is first demonstrated
that there can be no exact similarity law, which balances a change of the mass
ratio with that of another plasma parameter, leaving the physics unchanged.
Restricting then the analysis to the linear phase, a criterion allowing to
define a maximum ratio is explicated in terms of the hierarchy of the linear
unstable modes. The criterion is applied to the case of a relativistic electron
beam crossing an unmagnetized electron-ion plasma.

their behavioral pattern. This study investigates how the strategy evaluation
schemes adopted by agents affect their performance in conjunction with the
market circumstances. We observe the performance of three strategy evaluation
schemes, the history-dependent wealth game, the trend-opposing minority game,
and the trend-following majority game, in a stock market where the price is
exogenously determined. The price is either directly adopted from the real
stock market indices or generated with a Markov chain of order $\le 2$. Each
scheme's success is quantified by average wealth accumulated by the traders
equipped with the scheme. The wealth game, as it learns from the history, shows
relatively good performance unless the market is highly unpredictable. The
majority game is successful in a trendy market dominated by long periods of
sustained price increase or decrease. On the other hand, the minority game is
suitable for a market with persistent zig-zag price patterns. We also discuss
the consequence of implementing finite memory in the scoring processes of
strategies. Our findings suggest under which market circumstances each
evaluation scheme is appropriate for modeling the behavior of real market
traders.

spectrum in the Southern hemisphere at a significant level, between 3 sigma and
4 sigma depending on the exact range of multipoles considered. We do not find
significant power asymmetry in the gradient (curl) component EE (BB) of
polarized angular spectra. Also cross-correlation power spectra, i.e. TE, TB,
EB, show no significant hemispherical asymmetry. We also show that the Cold
Spot found by Vielva et al. (2004) in the Southern Galactic hemisphere does not
alter the significance of the hemispherical asymmetries on multipoles which can

constraints on the application of the Period-Luminosity relation at low metal
abundances, we investigate the properties of the few ultra-low metallicity (Z ~
0.0004) Cepheids recently discovered in the Blue Compact Dwarf galaxy IZw18. To
this purpose we have computed an updated and extended set of nonlinear
convective models for Z=0.0004 and Y=0.24, spanning a wide range of stellar
masses, and taking into account the evolutionary constraints for selected
luminosity levels. As a result we are able to predict the topology of the
instability strip, the variations of all the relevant quantities along the
pulsation cycle, including the morphology of the light curves, the theoretical
Period-Luminosity-Color, Period-Wesenheit and Period-Luminosity relations at
such a low metallicity. For each of these relations we provide the appropriate
coefficients for fundamental mode pulsators with Z=0.0004. By comparing these
results with the properties of more metal rich Cepheids we find that the
synthetic PL relations for Z=0.0004 are steeper than at higher Z, but similar
to the Z=0.004 ones, thus suggesting a leveling off of the metallicity effect
towards the lowest Zs.

method were used to determine the position of the lines of the [OIII] doublet,
both giving similar results. Using a clean sample containing 1568 of such
spectra, a value of Delta alpha /alpha=(+2.4 +-2.5) x 10^{-5} (in the range of
redshifts 0-0.8) was determined. The use of a larger number of spectra allows a
factor ~5 improvement on previous constraints based on the same method. On the
whole, we find no evidence of changes in alpha on such cosmological timescales.
The mean variation compatible with our results is 1/ <t> Delta
alpha/alpha=(+0.7 +- 0.7) x 10^{-14} yr^{-1}. The analysis was extended to the
[NeIII] and [SII] doublets, although their usefulness is limited due to the
fact that all these doublets in QSOs tend to be fainter than [OIII], and that
some of them are affected by systematics.

the brightest sources in the sky at TeV energies, showing frequent flaring
episodes. Using the data of ARGO-YBJ, a full coverage air shower detector
located at Yangbajing (4300 m a.s.l., Tibet, China), we monitored the source at
gamma ray energies E > 0.3 TeV during the whole year. The observed flux was
variable, with the strongest flares in March and June, in correlation with
X-ray enhanced activity. While during specific episodes the TeV flux could be
several times larger than the Crab Nebula one, the average emission from day 41
to 180 was almost twice the Crab level, with an integral flux of (3.6 +-0.6)
10^-11 photons cm^-2 s^-1 for energies E > 1 TeV, and decreased afterwards.
  This paper concentrates on the flares occurred in the first half of June.
This period has been deeply studied from optical to 100 MeV gamma rays, and
partially up to TeV energies, since the moonlight hampered the Cherenkov
telescope observations during the most intense part of the emission. Our data
complete these observations, with the detection of a signal with a statistical
significance of 3.8 standard deviations on June 11-13, corresponding to a gamma
ray flux about 6 times larger than the Crab one above 1 TeV. The reconstructed
differential spectrum, corrected for the intergalactic absorption, can be
represented by a power law with an index alpha = -2.1 extending up to several
TeV. The spectrum slope is fully consistent with previous observations
reporting a correlation between the flux and the spectral index, suggesting
that this property is maintained in different epochs and characterizes the
source emission processes.

chemical potential ($\mu_{B}$) plane and, therefore, its identification in the

state (EOS) for a deconfined QGP using a thermodynamically consistent
quasiparticle model involving quarks and gluons having thermal masses. We
further use a thermodynamically consistent excluded volume model for the hadron

first order deconfining phase transition is constructed using Gibbs' criteria.
This leads to an interesting finding that the phase transition line ends at a
critical point (CEP) beyond which a cross-over region exists. Using our thermal
HG model, we obtain a chemical freeze out curve and we find that the CEP lies
in close proximity to this curve as proposed by some authors. The coordinates

that these contributions to $\Gamma_{12}$ do not vanish in the exact

for $\Gamma_{12}$ orders of magnitude lower than the current experimental
value, we do find a sizeable phase. In the literature it was suggested that
higher order terms in the HQE might be much less affected by the severe GIM
cancellations of the leading terms; it is even not excluded that these higher
order terms can reproduce the experimental value of $y$. If such an enhancement
is realized in nature, the phase discovered in the leading HQE terms can have a
sizeable effect. Therefore, we think that statements like: {\it ""CP violating

vacuum expectation values (VEVs) to the spurion fields, and one encounters
Goldstone modes for every broken flavour symmetry generator. In this paper, we
point out various aspects related to the possible dynamical interpretation of
the Goldstone bosons: (i) In an effective-theory framework with local flavour
symmetry, the Goldstone fields represent the longitudinal modes for massive
gauge bosons. The spectrum of the latter follows the sequence of
flavour-symmetry breaking related to the hierarchies in Yukawa couplings and
flavour mixing angles. (ii) Gauge anomalies can be consistently treated by
adding higher-dimensional operators. (iii) Leaving the U(1) factors of the
flavour symmetry group as global symmetries, the respective Goldstone modes
behave as axions which can be used to resolve the strong CP problem by a
modified Peccei-Quinn mechanism. (iv) The dynamical picture of flavour symmetry
breaking implies new sources of flavour-changing neutral currents, which arise
from integrating out heavy scalar spurion fields and heavy gauge bosons. The

group over a field of characteristic zero from the modular point of view. Let
$G$ be such a group. The stack of all representations of a fixed finite
dimension $n$ is badly behaved. We introduce an invariant, $w$, of $G$, its
\textit{width}, as well as a certain nondegeneracy condition on
representations, and we prove that nondegenrate representations of dimension $n
\le w+1$ form a quasi-projective variety. Our definition of the width is
opaque; as a first attempt to elucidate its behavior, we prove that it is
bounded by the length of a composition series. Finally, we study the problem of
gluing a pair of nondegenerate representations along a common subquotient.

a realistic scenario making it possible to detect entanglement of a mechanical

Kerr squeezing for the ideal planar case can be prevented by disorder as a
result of multimode nonlinear coupling, even when the other modes are in the
vacuum state. However, the excess noise is a non-monotonous function of the
disorder amplitude. In the strong localization limit, we show that the system
becomes protected with respect to this fundamental coupling mechanism and that
the ideal quadrature squeezing generation can be obtained.

polymer model undergoing Rouse dynamics and focus on the nucleation of two
diffusing strands. We study numerically the dependence of various nucleation
rates on the strand lengths and on an additional local nucleation barrier. When
the local barrier is sufficiently high, all renaturation rates considered scale
with the length as predicted by Kramers' rate theory and are also in agreement
with experiments: their scaling behavior is governed by exponents describing
equilibrium properties of polymers. When the local barrier is lowered
renaturation occurs in a regime of genuine non-equilibrium behavior and the
scaling deviates from the rate theory prediction.

for super-charged nuclei $Ze^3 \ga 1$ within the framework of the Thomas-Fermi
equation generalized to the relativistic case. For $Ze^3 \gg 1$ the electron
shell penetrates inside the nucleus and almost completely screens its charge.
Inside such nucleus the potential takes a constant value equal to $V_0=-(3\pi^2
n_p)^{1/3} \sim -2m_{\pi}c^2$, and super-charged nucleus represents an
electrically neutral plasma consisting of $e,p$ and $n$. Near the edge of the
nucleus a transition layer exists with a width $\lambda \approx \alpha^{-1/2}
\hbar/m_{\pi} c\sim 15$ fm, which is independent of $Z (\hbar/m_{\pi} c \ll
\lambda \ll \hbar/m_e c)$. The electric field and surface charge are
concentrated in this layer. These results, obtained earlier for hypothetical
superheavy nuclei with $Z \sim A/2\la 10^4 \div 10^6$, are extrapolated to
massive nuclear density cores having a mass number $A \approx

electrodynamical stability of such objects is considered. It is shown that for
$A \ga 0.04 (Z/A)^{1/2}(m_{Planck}/m_n)^3$ the Coulomb repulsion of protons,
screened by relativistic electrons, can be balanced by gravitational forces.
The overcritical electric fields $E\sim m^2_{\pi} c^3/e\hbar$ are present in
the narrow transition layer near the core surface.

medium (ICM) in Abell 1689, combined with complementary analysis of the SDSS
data and weak and strong lensing analysis of Subaru/Suprime-Cam and HST/ACS
observations. Faint X-ray emission from the ICM around the virial radius is
detected at 4.0 sigma significance. We find anisotropic gas temperature and
entropy distributions in cluster outskirts correlated with large-scale
structure of galaxies. The high temperature and entropy region in the
northeastern (NE) outskirts is connected to an overdense filamentary structure.
The outskirt regions in contact with low density void environments have low gas
temperatures and entropies, deviating from hydrostatic equilibrium. These
results suggest that thermalization of the ICM occurs faster along the
filamentary structures than the void regions. A joint X-ray and lensing
analysis shows that the hydrostatic mass is $\sim60-90%$ of spherical lensing
one but comparable to a triaxial halo mass within errors in $0.6r_{2500} \simlt
r \simlt 0.8r_{500}$, and that it is significantly biased as low as $\simlt60%$
within $0.4r_{2500}$, irrespective of mass models. The thermal gas pressure
within $r_{500}$ is, at most, $\sim50$--60% of the total pressure to balance
fully the gravity of the spherical lensing mass, and $\sim30$--40% around the
virial radius. Although these constitute lower limits when one considers the
possible halo triaxiality, these small relative contributions of thermal
pressure would require additional sources of pressure, such as bulk and/or
turbulent motions.
