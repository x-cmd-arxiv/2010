030329. Especially, a marked and quick rebrightening occurred at about t ~ 1.2
* 10^5 s. Energy injection from late and slow shells seems to be the best
interpretation for these rebrightenings. Usually it is assumed that the energy
is injected into the whole external shock. However, in the case of GRB 030329,
the rebrightenings are so quick that the usual consideration fails to give a
satisfactory fit to the observed light curves. Actually, since these late/slow
shells coast freely in the wake of the external shock, they should be cold and
may not expand laterally. The energy injection then should only occur at the
central region of the external shock. Considering this effect, we numerically
re-fit the quick rebrightenings observed in GRB 030329. By doing this, we were
able to derive the beaming angle of the energy injection process. Our result,
with a relative residual of only 5% - 10% during the major rebrightening, is
better than any previous modeling. The derived energy injection angle is about
0.035. We assume that these late shells are ejected by the central engine via
the same mechanism as those early shells that produce the prompt gamma-ray
burst. The main difference is that their velocities are much slower, so that
they catch up with the external shock very lately and manifest as the observed
quick rebrightenings. If this were true, then the derived energy injection
angle can give a good measure of the beaming angle of the prompt gamma-ray
emission. Our study may hopefully provide a novel method to measure the beaming
angle of gamma-ray bursts.

dimensional, and its gross properties do not depend on the details of the

lasts about one Alfven time, but only after a delay during which the field
lines evolve into a critical configuration. We present a physical picture of
the process. The reconnection regions are dynamical and mutually interacting.
In the comoving frame of these regions, reconnection occurs through an X-like

addition, unlike that of the equal-mass particles case where the three-body

and becomes negative at large momenta and then decays slowly to zero when the
mass ratio of the fermions to the third particle is higher than a critical

processes that describe the spread of opinions on networks. The former includes
social influence, the tendency of individuals to become more similar when they
interact, while the latter also accounts for homophily, the tendency to
interact more frequently with individuals which are more similar. The Axelrod
model has been extensively studied during the past ten years based on numerical
simulations. In contrast, we give rigorous analytical results for a
generalization of the voter model that is closely related to the Axelrod model
as it combines social influence and confidence threshold, which is modeled
somewhat similarly to homophily. Each vertex of the network, represented by a
finite connected graph, is characterized by an opinion and may interact with
its adjacent vertices. Like the voter model, an interaction results in an
agreement between both interacting vertices -- social influence -- but unlike
the voter model, an interaction takes place if and only if the vertices'
opinions are within a certain distance -- confidence threshold. In a
deterministic static approach, we first give lower and upper bounds for the
maximum number of opinions that can be supported by the network as a function
of the confidence threshold and various characteristics of the graph. The
number of opinions coexisting at equilibrium is then investigated in a
probabilistic dynamic approach for the stochastic process starting from a
random configuration ...

evolution of a population in a patchy environment, focusing on whether a
population already established in one patch either successfully invades an
adjacent empty patch or undergoes a global in-all-patch extinction. Our study
is based on the combination of analytical and numerical results for both a
deterministic two-patch model and its stochastic analog. The deterministic
model has either two or four attractors. In the presence of weak dispersal, the
analysis of the deterministic model shows that a high-density and a low-density
populations can coexist at equilibrium in nearby patches, whereas the analysis
of the stochastic model indicates that this equilibrium is metastable, thus
leading after a large random time to either an in-all-patch expansion or an
in-all-patch extinction. Up to some critical dispersal, increasing the
intensity of the interactions leads to an increase of both the basin of
attraction of the in-all-patch extinction and the basin of attraction of the
in-all-patch expansion. Above this threshold, while increasing the intensity of
the dispersal, both deterministic and stochastic models predict a
synchronization of the patches resulting in either a global expansion or a
global extinction: for the deterministic model, two of the four attractors
present when the dispersal is weak are lost, while the stochastic model no
longer exhibits a metastable behavior. In the presence of strong dispersal, the
limiting behavior is entirely determined by the value of the Allee threshold as
the global population size in the deterministic and the stochastic two-patch
models evolves as dictated by the single-patch counterparts ...

indicate the importance of jets interactions with the environment on many
different physical scales. Morphology of X-ray clusters indicate that the
radio-jet activity of a cD galaxy is intermittent. This intermittency might be
a result of a feedback and/or interactions between galaxies within the cluster.
Here we consider the radiation pressure instability operating on short
timescales (<10^5 years) as the origin of the intermittent behaviour. We test
whether this instability can be responsible for short ages (< 10^4 years) of
Compact Symmetric Objects measured by hot spots propagation velocities in VLBI
observations. We model the accretion disk evolution and constrain model
parameters that may explain the observed compact radio structures and
over-abundance of GPS sources. We also describe effects of consequent

electronic structure found by ab initio calculations for the 122 materials,
making this system less amenable to model development. In addition, the more
complicated Brillouin zone (BZ) of the body-centered tetragonal symmetry does
not allow a straightforward unfolding of the electronic band structure into an
effective 1Fe/unit cell BZ. Here we present an effective 5-orbital
tight-binding fit of the full DFT band structure for BaFeAs including the kz
dispersions. We compare the 5-orbital spin fluctuation model to one previously
studied for LaOFeAs and calculate the RPA enhanced susceptibility. Using the
fluctuation exchange approximation to determine the leading pairing
instability, we then examine the differences between a strictly two dimensional
model calculation over a single kz cut of the BZ and a completely three
dimensional approach. We find pairing states quite similar to the 1111
materials, with generic quasi-isotropic pairing on the hole sheets and nodal
states on the electron sheets at kz = 0 which however are gapped as the system
is hole doped. On the other hand, a substantial kz dependence of the order
parameter remains, with most of the pairing strength deriving from processes
near kz = pi. These states exhibit a tendency for an enhanced anisotropy on the
hole sheets and a reduced anisotropy on the electron sheets near the top of the
BZ.

analytically for any dimension d. We discuss solutions obtained for processes
described by the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Mehl-Johnson model for random nucleation and
growth (RNG). Nucleation and growth are set on the same footing, which leads to
a time-dependent decay of both effective rates. We analyze in detail how model

influence the shape of the distribution. The calculations show that the
dynamics of the effective nucleation and effective growth rates play an
essential role in determining the final form of the distribution obtained at

orders, the bid-ask spread, and the volume imbalance increase before the
extreme events and decay slowly as a power law, which forms a well-established
peak. The volume of buy market orders increases faster and the corresponding
peak appears earlier than for sell market orders around positive events, while
the volume peak of sell market orders leads buy market orders in the magnitude
and time around negative events. When orders are divided into four groups
according to their aggressiveness, we find that the behaviors of order volume
and order number are similar, except for buy limit orders and canceled orders
that the peak of order number postpones two minutes later after the peak of
order volume, implying that investors placing large orders are more informed
and play a central role in large price fluctuations. We also study the relative
rates of different types of orders and find differences in the dynamics of
relative rates between buy orders and sell orders and between individual

institutions behave very differently from individuals and that they have more
aggressive strategies. Combing these findings, we conclude that institutional

Perhaps surprisingly, this analysis extends to quantum mechanics: even

universally accepted notion that quantum particles of the same kind are

allows one to generate multipartite entanglement between several spatial modes
of the electromagnetic field. It is based on parametric down-conversion with N
pairs of symmetrically-tilted plane waves serving as a pump. The
characteristics of this spatial entanglement are investigated in the cases of
zero as well as nonzero phase mismatch. Furthermore, the phenomenon of
entanglement localization in just two spatial modes is studied in detail and
results in an enhancement of the entanglement by a factor square root of N.

describes several such situations where simple product limit estimators, though
inefficient, may still be useful.

prove a simple classification of all localizing subcategories of the Bootstrap
category of separable complex C*-algebras. Namely, they are in bijective
correspondence with subsets of the Zariski spectrum of the integers --
precisely as for the localizing subcategories of the derived category of
complexes of abelian groups. We provide corollaries of this fact and put it in
context with similar classifications available in the literature.
