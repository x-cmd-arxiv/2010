CP Pup, T Pyx, V4633 Sgr, and RW UMi) are separated out as being significantly
distinct from other novae. This group shares a suite of uncommon properties,
characterized by the post-eruption magnitude being much brighter than before
eruption, short orbital periods, long-lasting supersoft emission following the
eruption, a highly magnetized white dwarf, and secular declines during the
post-eruption quiescence. We present a basic physical picture which shows why
all five uncommon properties are causally connected. Most novae do not have
adequate accretion for continuous hydrogen burning, but some can achieve this
if the companion star is nearby (with short orbital period) and a magnetic
field channels the matter onto a small area on the white dwarf so as to produce
a locally high accretion rate. The resultant supersoft flux irradiates the
companion star and drives a higher accretion rate (with a brighter
post-eruption phase), which serves to keep the hydrogen burning and the
supersoft flux going. The feedback loop cannot be perfectly self-sustaining, so
the supersoft flux will decline over time, forcing a decline in the accretion
rate and the system brightness. We name this new group after the prototype,
V1500 Cyg. V1500 Cyg stars are definitely not progenitors of Type Ia
supernovae. The V1500 Cyg stars have similar physical mechanisms and
appearances as predicted for nova by the hibernation model, but with this group

rate of convergence of the probability of decoding failure to zero. We provide

landscape of computer software. Traditionally, most software was written for a
single computer with one CPU. However applications on the web today are built
using numerous interacting services deployed on across many machines; soon
off-the-shelf CPUs will host thousands of cores, and sensor networks will be
composed from a large number of processing units. Many normal applications will
soon need to make effective use of thousands of computing nodes. At some level
of granularity, computation in such systems will be inherently concurrent and
communication-centred.
  The development of effective programming methodologies for the coming
computing paradigm demands exploration and understanding of a wide variety of
ideas and techniques. This workshop offered a forum where researchers from
different fields could exchange new ideas on one of the central challenges for
programming in the near future, the development of programming methodologies
and infrastructures where concurrency and distribution are the norm rather than
a marginal concern.

days. A large contribution to the discussion of possible interpretations of
quantum mechanics is given by the so-called impossibility proofs for hidden
variable models; models that allow a realist interpretation.
  In this thesis some of these proofs are discussed, like von Neumann's
Theorem, the Kochen-Specker Theorem and the Bell-inequalities. Some more recent
developments are also investigated, like Meyer's nullification of the
Kochen-Specker Theorem, the MKC-models and Conway and Kochen's Free Will
Theorem. This last one is taken to suggest that the problems that arise for
certain interpretations of quantum mechanics are not limited to realist
interpretations only, but also affect certain instrumentalist interpretations.
  It is argued that one may arrive at a more satisfying interpretation of
quantum mechanics if one adopts a logic that seems more compatible with the
instrumentalist viewpoint namely, intuitionistic logic. The motivations for
adopting this form of logic rather than classical logic or quantum logic are
linked to some of the philosophical ideas of Bohr. In particular a new
interpretation of Bohr's notion of complementarity is proposed. Finally some
possibilities are explored for linking the intuitionistic interpretation of
quantum mechanics to the mathematical formalism of the theory.

maintain a dynamic coupling to microtubules for force generation during the
complex motions of mitosis remains elusive. The current paradigm of molecular
cell biology requires that specific molecules, or molecular geometries, for

curvature and bilayer coupling), we determine numerically the sequence of
vesicle shapes through an enthalpy minimization, as well as the fluid-body

continuously modulating fore-aft asymmetric vesicle shapes, or by crossing a
continuous shape-transition region and alternating between fore-aft asymmetric

similar to that of other low Reynolds number biological swimmers, and suggest
that shape-changing vesicles might provide an alternative to flagella-based

between independent pathways to the same target state is examined in the
context of coherent control of atomic and molecular processes, with emphasis
placed on possible ""which-way"" information due to quantum entanglement
established in the quantum dynamics. Because quantum interference between
independent pathways to the same target state occurs only when the independent
pathways are indistinguishable, it is first shown that creating useful
coherence (as defined in the paper) between nondegenerate states of a molecule
for subsequent quantum interference manipulation cannot be achieved by
collisions between atoms or molecules that are prepared in momentum and energy
eigenstates. Coherence can, however, be transferred from light fields to atoms
or molecules. Using a particular coherent control scenario, it is shown that
this coherence transfer and the subsequent coherent phase control can be
readily realized by the most classical states of light, i.e., coherent states
of light. It is further demonstrated that quantum states of light may suppress
the extent of phase-sensitive coherent control by leaking out some which-way
information while ""incoherent interference control"" scenarios proposed in the
literature have automatically ensured the indistinguishability of multiple
excitation pathways. The possibility of quantum coherence in photodissociation
product states is also understood in terms of the disentanglement between
photodissociation fragments. Results offer deeper insights into quantum
coherence generation in atomic and molecular processes.

maximum radius of 13 equal size nonoverlapping spheres touching the unit
sphere. In the paper we give a solution of this long-standing open problem in
geometry. Our computer-assisted proof is based on a enumeration of the
so-called irreducible graphs.

the 500 meV peak observed at ${\bf q}=(\pi,0)$ in resonant inelastic x-ray
scattering (RIXS) experiments on $\rm La_2CuO_4$. The intensity of this peak
persists above the N\'eel temperature (T$_{N}$=320 K), but decreases gradually
with increasing temperature, reaching zero at around T=500 K. The peak energy
decreases with temperature in close quantitative accord with the behavior of
the two-magnon $\rm B_{1g}$ Raman peak in $\rm La_2CuO_4$, and with suitable
rescaling, agrees with the Raman peak shifts in $\rm EuBa_2Cu_3O_6$ and $\rm
K_2NiF_4$. The overall dispersion of this excitation in the Brillouin zone is
found to be in agreement with theoretical calculations for a two-magnon
excitation. Upon doping, the peak intensity decreases analogous to the Raman
mode intensity and appears to track the doping dependence of the spin
correlation length. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that
the 500 meV mode is magnetic in character and is likely a two-magnon
excitation.

the constellation points are extended such that the PAPR is minimized but the

an iterative ACE method is extended to spatially encoded OFDM systems. The
proposed methods are such that the PAPR is reduced simultaneously at all
antennas, while the spatial encoding relationships still hold. It will be shown
that the original ACE method can be employed before Space Time Block Coding
(STBC). But in case of Space Frequency Block Coding (SFBC), two modified
techniques have been proposed. In the first method, the OFDM frame is separated
by several subframes and the ACE method is applied to these subframes
independently to reduce their corresponding PAPRs. Then the low PAPR subframes
are recombined based on SFBC relationships to yield the transmitted signals
from different antennas. In the second method, for each iteration, the ACE is
applied to the antenna with the maximum PAPR, and the signals of the other
antennas are generated from that of this antenna. Simulation results show that
both algorithms converge, but the second method outperforms the first one when
the number of antennas is increased.

evolution models tell us that, if a low-mass star with this composition had
been created (a ""zero-metal"" star) at that time, it would still be shining on
the Main Sequence today. Over the last 40 years there have been many efforts to
detect such primordial stars but none has so-far been found. The lowest
metallicity stars known have a metal content, Z, which is of the order of
10e-4Z_Sun. These are also the lowest metallicity objects known in the
Universe. This seems to support the theories of star formation which predict
that only high mass stars could form with a primordial composition and require
a minimum metallicity to allow the formation of low-mass stars. Yet, since
absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, we cannot exclude the existence
of such low-mass zero-metal stars, at present. If we have not found the first
Galactic stars, as a by product of our searches we have found their direct
descendants, stars of extremely low metallicity (Z<=10e-3Z_Sun). The chemical
composition of such stars contains indirect information on the nature of the
stars responsible for the nucleosynthesis of the metals. Such a fossil record

nuclear star clusters and their host galaxies, an extension of the known
correlations between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies.
By focusing on disk galaxies with well-determined black hole and nuclear
cluster masses, we argue that there is not a universal ""central massive object""
correlation after all: careful analysis shows that while SMBHs correlate better
with the stellar masses of the bulge components, nuclear star clusters clearly
correlate better with total galaxy stellar mass.
