recently been confirmed. Using simultaneously all the available data from UV to
radio we have modeled the spectral energy distributions of the six known
spectroscopically confirmed SMGs at z>4. We find that their star formation
rates (average ~2500 MSun yr^{-1}), stellar (~3.6x10^{11} MSun) and dust
(~6.7x10^{8} MSun) masses, extinction (A_V~2.2 mag), and gas-to-dust ratios
(~60) are within the ranges for 1.7<z<3.6 SMGs. Our analysis suggests that
infrared-to-radio luminosity ratios of SMGs do not change up to redshift ~5 and
are lower by a factor of ~2.1 than the value corresponding to the local
IR-radio correlation. However, we also find dissimilarities between z>4 and
lower-redshift SMGs. Those at z>4 tend to be among the most star-forming, least
massive and hottest (~60 K) SMGs and exhibit the highest fraction of stellar
mass formed in the ongoing starburst (~45%). This indicates that at z>4 we see
earlier stages of evolution of submillimeter-bright galaxies. Using the derived
properties for z>4 SMGs we investigate the origin of dust at epochs less than
1.5 Gyr after the big bang. This is significant to our understanding of the
evolution of the early universe. For three z>4 SMGs, asymptotic giant branch
stars could be the dominant dust producers. However, for the remaining three
only supernovae (SNe) are efficient and fast enough to be responsible for dust
production, though requiring a very high dust yield per SN (0.15-0.65 MSun).
The required dust yields are lower if a top-heavy initial mass function or
significant dust growth in the interstellar medium is assumed. We estimate
lower limits of the contribution of SMGs to the cosmic star formation and
stellar mass densities at z~4-5 to be ~4% and ~1%, respectively.

reaction at binary separations r < 1000 M, yet it is too computationally
expensive to begin numerical-relativity simulations with initial separations r
> 10 M. Fortunately, binary evolution between these separations is well
described by post-Newtonian equations of motion. We examine how this
post-Newtonian evolution affects the distribution of spin orientations at
separations r ~ 10 M where numerical-relativity simulations typically begin.
Although isotropic spin distributions at r ~ 1000 M remain isotropic at r ~ 10
M, distributions that are initially partially aligned with the orbital angular
momentum can be significantly distorted during the post-Newtonian inspiral.
Spin precession tends to align (anti-align) the binary black hole spins with
each other if the spin of the more massive black hole is initially partially
aligned (anti-aligned) with the orbital angular momentum, thus increasing
(decreasing) the average final spin. Spin precession is stronger for
comparable-mass binaries, and could produce significant spin alignment before
merger for both supermassive and stellar-mass black hole binaries. We also
point out that precession induces an intrinsic accuracy limitation (< 0.03 in
the dimensionless spin magnitude, < 20 degrees in the direction) in predicting
the final spin resulting from the merger of widely separated binaries.

dark matter WIMPs. Demonstrating that a putative signal is due to WIMPs, and
not backgrounds, is a major challenge however. The direction dependence of the
WIMP scattering rate provides a potential WIMP `smoking gun'. If the WIMP
distribution is predominantly smooth, the Galactic recoil distribution is
peaked in the direction opposite to the direction of Solar motion. Previous
studies have found that, for an ideal detector, of order 10 WIMP events would
be sufficient to reject isotropy, and rule out an isotropic background. We
examine how the median recoil direction could be used to confirm the WIMP
origin of an anisotropic recoil signal. Specifically we determine the number of
events required to reject the null hypothesis that the median direction is
random (corresponding to an isotropic Galactic recoil distribution) at 95%
confidence. We find that for zero background 31 events are required, a factor
of roughly 2 more than are required to simply reject isotropy. We also
investigate the effect of a non-zero isotropic background. As the background
rate is increased the number of events required increases, initially fairly
gradually and then more rapidly, once the signal becomes subdominant. We also
discuss the effect of features in the speed distribution at large speeds, as
found in recent high resolution simulations, on the median recoil direction.

(canonical transformations for fermions) for one fermionic mode, in the present
paper we perform a thorough study of general (nonlinear) canonical
transformations for two fermionic modes. We find that the Bogolyubov-Valatin
group for n=2 fermionic modes which can be implemented by means of unitary
SU(2^n = 4) transformations is isomorphic to SO(6;R)/Z_2. The investigation
touches on a number of subjects. As a novelty from a mathematical point of
view, we study the structure of nonlinear basis transformations in a Clifford
algebra [specifically, in the Clifford algebra C(0,4)] entailing
(supersymmetric) transformations among multivectors of different grades. A
prominent algebraic role in this context is being played by biparavectors
(linear combinations of products of Dirac matrices, quadriquaternions,
sedenions) and spin bivectors (antisymmetric complex matrices). The studied
biparavectors are equivalent to Eddington's E-numbers and can be understood in
terms of the tensor product of two commuting copies of the division algebra of
quaternions H. From a physical point of view, we present a method to
diagonalize any arbitrary two-fermion Hamiltonian. Relying on Jordan-Wigner
transformations for two-spin-1/2 and single-spin-3/2 systems, we also study
nonlinear spin transformations and the related problem of diagonalizing
arbitrary two-spin-1/2 and single-spin-3/2 Hamiltonians. Finally, from a
calculational point of view, we pay due attention to explicit parametrizations
of SU(4) and SO(6;R) matrices (of respective sizes 4x4 and 6x6) and their
mutual relation.

highly precise measurements of the electron/muon orbital g, i.e. gL. First, we
briefly review results obtained using an extended Dirac equation, which
conclusively showed that, as a consequence of quantum relativistic corrections
arising from the time-dependence of the rest-energy, the electron gyromagnetic
factors are corrected. It is next demonstrated, using the data of Kusch & Foley
on the measurement of deltaS minus 2 deltaL together with the modern precise
measurements of the electron deltaS where deltaS identically equal to gS minus
2, that deltaL may be a small, non-zero quantity, where we have assumed
Russel-Saunders LS coupling and proposed, along with Kusch and Foley, that gS =
2 plus deltaS and gS = 1 plus deltaL. Therefore, there is probable evidence
from experimental data that gS is not exactly equal to 1; the expectation that
quantum effects will significantly modify the classical value of the orbital g
is therefore reasonable. Finally, we show that if, as suggested by the results
obtained from the modified Dirac theory, deltaS and deltaL depend linearly on a
dimensionless parameter DELTA such that the gyromagnetic factors are considered
corrected as follows; gS = 2 plus 2 DELTA and gL = 1 minus DELTA, then the
Kusch-Foley data implies that the correction DELTA approximately equals 1.0
times 10-3 . Modern, high precision measurements of the electron and muon
orbital gL are therefore required, in order to properly determine by
experiments the true value of gL minus 1, perhaps to about one part in a
trillion as was recently done for gS minus 2.

observed in the direction of the bulge is Ro=8.1+-0.6 kpc. An accurate

extinction law, a bias for smaller values of Ro because of a preferential
sampling of variable stars toward the near side of the bulge owing to
extinction, and an uncertainty in characterizing how a mean distance to the

RR Lyrae variables is derived to map extinction throughout the bulge. The
reddening inferred from RR Lyrae variables in the Galactic bulge, LMC, SMC, and
IC 1613 match that established from OGLE red clump giants and classical
Cepheids. RR Lyrae variables obey a period-colour (VI) relation that is
relatively insensitive to metallicity. Edge-on and face-on illustrations of the

equivalence between Disk and Theta is demonstrated in Sections 4 and 6 using

assess the electrostatic contribution to the translocation free energy barrier
of a model DNA segment by evaluating the potential of mean force in absence and
presence of polarization effects by means of coarse-grained molecular dynamics
simulations. The effect of induced polarization charges has been taken into
account by employing ICC*, a recently developed algorithm that can efficiently
compute induced polarization charges induced on suitably discretized dielectric
boundaries. Since water has a higher dielectric constant than the pore walls,
polarization effects repel charged objects in the vicinity of the interface,
with the effect of significantly increasing the free energy barrier. Another
investigated side effect is the change of the counterion distribution around
the charged polymer in presence of the induced pore charges. Furthermore we
investigate the influence of adding salt to the solution.

the positive part U_q(n) of the universal enveloping algebra of a Kac-Moody Lie
algebra of type A_1^{(1)}. The examined subalgebra is associated with a
terminal module M over the path algebra of the Kronecker quiver via an Weyl
group element w of length four.
  Geiss-Leclerc-Schroeer attached to M a category C_M of nilpotent modules over
the preprojective algebra of the Kronecker quiver together with an acyclic
cluster algebra A(C_M). The dual semicanonical basis contains all cluster
monomials. By construction, the cluster algebra A(C_M) is a subalgebra of the
graded dual of the (non-quantized) universal enveloping algebra U(n).
  We transfer to the quantized setup. Following Lusztig we attach to w a
subalgebra U_q^+(w) of U_q(n). The subalgebra is generated by four elements
that satisfy straightening relations; it degenerates to a commutative algebra
in the classical limit q=1. The algebra U_q^+(w) possesses four bases, a PBW
basis, a canonical basis, and their duals. We prove recursions for dual
canonical basis elements. The recursions imply that every cluster variable in
A(C_M) is the specialization of the dual of an appropriate canonical basis
element. Therefore, U_q^+(w) is a quantum cluster algebra in the sense of
Berenstein-Zelevinsky. Furthermore, we give explicit formulae for the quantized
cluster variables and for expansions of products of dual canonical basis
elements.

observational signature of the Newtonian virial theorem, is defined by high
surface brightness objects that deviate from being purely isothermal: the
line-of-sight velocity dispersion should slowly decline with radius as observed
in luminous elliptical galaxies. All high surface brightness objects (e.g.
globular clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs) will lie, more or less, on the
fundamental plane defined by elliptical galaxies, but low surface brightness
objects (dwarf spheroidals) would be expected to deviate from this relation.
This is borne out by observations. With MOND, the Faber-Jackson relation (the
power-law relation between luminosity and velocity dispersion), ranging from
globular clusters to clusters of galaxies and including both high and low
surface brightness objects, is the more fundamental and universal scaling
relation in spite of its larger scatter. Faber-Jackson reflects the presence of
an additional dimensional constant (the MOND acceleration) in the structure
equation.
