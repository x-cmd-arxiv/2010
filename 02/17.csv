copiously produced at LEP and the Tevatron without being detected. We study a
novel scenario of this type in which the Higgs decays predominantly into a
light hidden sector either directly or through light SUSY states. Subsequent
cascades increase the multiplicity of hidden sector particles which, after
decaying back into the Standard Model, appear in the detector as clusters of
collimated leptons known as lepton jets. We identify the relevant collider
observables that characterize this scenario, and study a wide range of LEP and
Tevatron searches to recover the viable regions in the space of observables. We
find that the Higgs decaying to lepton jets can be hidden when the event
topology mimics that of hadronic backgrounds. Thus, as many as 10^4 leptonic
Higgs and SUSY decays may be hiding in the LEP and Tevatron data. We present
benchmark models with a 100 GeV Higgs that are consistent with all available
collider constraints. We end with a short discussion of strategies for
dedicated searches at LEP, the Tevatron and the LHC, that allow for a discovery
of the Higgs or SUSY particles decaying to lepton jets.

to the Einstein-Hilbert action: (partial phi)^2, lambda phi^4, and xi phi^2 R,
with xi a large non-minimal coupling. Recently there has been much discussion
as to whether such theories make sense quantum mechanically and if the inflaton
phi can also be the Standard Model Higgs. In this note we answer these
questions. Firstly, for a single scalar phi, we show that the quantum field
theory is well behaved in the pure gravity and kinetic sectors, since the
quantum generated corrections are small. However, the theory likely breaks down
at ~ m_pl / xi due to scattering provided by the self-interacting potential
lambda phi^4. Secondly, we show that the theory changes for multiple scalars
phi with non-minimal coupling xi phi dot phi R, since this introduces
qualitatively new interactions which manifestly generate large quantum
corrections even in the gravity and kinetic sectors, spoiling the theory for
energies > m_pl / xi. Since the Higgs doublet of the Standard Model includes
the Higgs boson and 3 Goldstone bosons, it falls into the latter category and
therefore its validity is manifestly spoiled. We show that these conclusions
hold in both the Jordan and Einstein frames and describe an intuitive analogy
in the form of the pion Lagrangian. We also examine the recent claim that
curvature-squared inflation models fail quantum mechanically. Our work appears
to go beyond the recent discussions.

particles are fundamentally different in the context of solving a particular
computational problem. Specifically, we consider the graph isomorphism problem,
in which one wishes to determine whether two graphs are isomorphic (related to
each other by a relabeling of the graph vertices), and focus on a class of
graphs with particularly high symmetry called strongly regular graphs (SRG's).
We study the Green's functions that characterize the dynamical evolution
single-particle and two-particle quantum walks on pairs of non-isomorphic SRG's
and show that interacting particles can distinguish non-isomorphic graphs that
noninteracting particles cannot. We obtain the following specific results: (1)
We prove that quantum walks of two noninteracting particles, Fermions or
Bosons, cannot distinguish certain pairs of non-isomorphic SRG's. (2) We
demonstrate numerically that two interacting Bosons are more powerful than
single particles and two noninteracting particles, in that quantum walks of
interacting bosons distinguish all non-isomorphic pairs of SRGs that we
examined. By utilizing high-throughput computing to perform over 500 million
direct comparisons between evolution operators, we checked all tabulated pairs
of non-isomorphic SRGs, including graphs with up to 64 vertices. (3) By
performing a short-time expansion of the evolution operator, we derive
distinguishing operators that provide analytic insight into the power of the
interacting two-particle quantum walk.

(BEC) in the case of several models. A convenient expression for the density of
particles on cycles of length $q$ is obtained, in terms of $q$ unsymmetrised
particles coupled with a boson field. Using this formulation we reproduce known
results on the Ideal Bose Gas, Mean-Field and Perturbed Mean-Field Models,
where the condensate density exactly equals the long cycle density.
  Then we consider the Infinite-Range-Hopping Bose-Hubbard model, with and
without hard-cores. For the hard-core case, we find we can disregard the
hopping contribution of the q unsymmetrised particles to obtain an exact
expression for the density of particles on long cycles. It is shown that only
the cycle of length one contributes to the cycle density. We conclude that
while the existence of a non-zero long cycle density coincides with the
occurrence of Bose-Einstein condensation, the respective densities are not
necessarily equal.
  For the case of a finite on-site repulsion, we obtain an expression for the
cycle density by neglecting the $q$ unsymmetrised hop. Inspired by the
Approximating Hamiltonian method we conjecture a simplified expression for the
short cycle density as a ratio of single-site partition functions. In the
absence of condensation we prove that this simplification is exact and find
that in this case the long-cycle density vanishes. In the presence of
condensation we justify this simplification when a gauge-symmetry breaking term
is introduced in the Hamiltonian. Assuming our conjecture is correct, we
compare numerically the long-cycle density with the condensate and again find
that though they coexist, in general they are not equal.

(upper bound of $\frac{Eb}{N_0}=2.67$dB) on the threshold of $(3,6)$-regular
LDPC codes whose factor graphs have logarithmic girth.
  Our proof is an extension of a recent paper of Arora, Daskalakis, and Steurer
[STOC 2009] who presented a novel probabilistic analysis of LP decoding over a
binary symmetric channel. Their analysis is based on the primal LP
representation and has an explicit connection to message passing algorithms. We
extend this analysis to any MBIOS channel.

and the compact stars, we need the hadronic density of states for the entire
($\mu_B-T$) phase transition diagram. We present a model for the continuous
high-lying mass (and volume) spectrum density of states that fits the Hagedorn
mass spectrum. This model explains the origin of the tri-critical point besides
various phenomena such as the quarkyonic matter and the quark-gluon liquid. The
Hagedorn mass spectrum is derived for the color-singlet quark-gluon bag with
various internal structures such as the unimodular unitary, orthogonal and
color-flavor locked symplectic symmetry groups. The continuous high-lying
hadronic mass spectrum is populated at first by the unitary Hagedorn states.
Then the spectrum turns to be dominated by the colorless orthogonal states as
the dilute system is heated up. Subsequently, the liquid/gas of orthogonal
Hagedorn states undergoes higher order deconfinement phase transition to
quark-gluon plasma. Under the deconfinement phase transition process, the
color-singlet states is broken badly to form the colored $SU(N_c)$ symmetry
group. On the other hand, when the hadronic matter is compressed to larger
$\mu_{B}$ and heated up, the colorless unitary states undergoes first order
phase transition to explosive quark-gluon plasma. The tri-critical point
emerges as a change in the characteristic behaviour of the matter and as an
intersection among various phases with different internal symmetries. When the
saturated hadronic matter is cooled down and compressed to higher density, it
turns to be dominated by the colorless symplectic states. This matter exhibits
the first order phase transition to quark-gluon plasma when it is heated up to
higher temperature. The role of chiral phase transition is also discussed.

analysis of the GC system that extends out to 45 arcmin in galactocentric
radius. We have examined the systemic velocity, projected rotation amplitude
and axis, and the projected velocity dispersion of the GCs as functions of
galactocentric distance and metallicity. Our results indicate that the
metal-poor GCs have a very mild rotation signature of (26 pm 15) km/s. The
metal-rich GCs are rotating with a higher, though still small signature of (43
pm 15) km/s around the isophotal major axis of NGC 5128 within 15 arcmin. Their
velocity dispersions are consistent within the uncertainties and the profiles
appear flat or declining within 20 arcmin. We note the small sample of
metal-rich GCs with ages less than 5 Gyr in the literature appear to have
different kinematic properties than the old, metal-rich GC subpopulation. The
mass and mass-to-light ratios have also been estimated using the GCs as tracer
particles for NGC 5128. Out to a distance of 20 arcmin, we have obtained a mass
of (5.9 pm 2.0) x 10^(11) M_(sun) and a mass-to-light ratio in the B-band of 16
M_(sun)/L_(B,sun). Combined with previous work on the ages and metallicities of
its GCs, as well as properties of its stellar halo, our findings suggest NGC
5128 formed via hierarchical merging over other methods of formation, such as
major merging at late times.

conservative assumptions about the recoiling velocity of CHAMPs in the decay

for decaying neutral DM must be > (0.9-3.4)x 10^3 Gyr. Even assuming the
gyroradii of CHAMPs in the Galactic magnetic field are too small for halo
CHAMPs to reach Earth, the present-day fraction of the mass of the Galactic

NLR in the case of [FeVII] and [NeV] lines. The CL profiles strongly vary with
the distance to the nucleus. We observed line splitting in the core of some of

500 km/s, and even higher velocities (1000 km/s) in some of the galaxies. In
general, CLs follow the same pattern of rotation curves as low-ionisation lines
like [OIII]. From a direct comparison between the radio and the CL emission we
find that neither the strength nor the kinematics of the CLs scale in any
obvious and strong way with the radio jets. Moreover, the similarity of the
flux distributions and kinematics of the CLs and low-ionisation lines, the low

identified reliable counterparts for 446 (96.5%) of the X-ray sources, with an
expected false-match probability of ~6.2%. A likelihood-ratio method is used
for source matching, which effectively reduces the false-match probability at
faint magnitudes compared to a simple error-circle matching method. We
construct a master photometric catalog for the identified X-ray sources
including up to 42 bands of UV-to-infrared data, and then calculate their
photometric redshifts (photo-z's). The reliability of the photo-z's is
evaluated using the subsample of 220 sources with secure spectroscopic
redshifts. We achieve an accuracy of ~1% [|Delta z|/(1+z)] and an outlier
fraction of ~1.4% for sources with spectroscopic redshifts. We performed blind
tests to derive a more realistic estimate of the photo-z quality for sources
without spectroscopic redshifts. We expect there are ~9% outliers for the
relatively brighter sources (R<26), and the outlier fraction will increase to
~15-25% for the fainter sources (R>26). The typical photo-z accuracy is ~6-7%.
The outlier fraction and photo-z accuracy do not appear to have a redshift
dependence (for z~0-4). These photo-z's appear to be the best obtained so far

correlated with the mass of the galaxy bulges which host them. This observed
correlation implies a mechanism of joint growth, but the precise physical
processes responsible are a matter of some debate. Here we report on the growth
of black holes in 400 local galactic bulges which have experienced a strong
burst of star formation in the past 600Myr. The black holes in our sample have
typical masses of 10^6.5-10^7.5 solar masses, and the active nuclei have
bolometric luminosities of order 10^42-10^44erg/s. We combine stellar continuum
indices with H-alpha luminosities to measure a decay timescale of ~300Myr for
the decline in star formation after a starburst. During the first 600Myr after
a starburst, the black holes in our sample increase their mass by on-average 5%
and the total mass of stars formed is about 1000 times the total mass accreted
onto the black hole. This ratio is similar to the ratio of stellar to black
hole mass observed in present-day bulges. We find that the average rate of
accretion of matter onto the black hole rises steeply roughly 250Myr after the
onset of the starburst. We show that our results are consistent with a simple
model in which 0.5% of the mass lost by intermediate mass stars in the bulge is
accreted by the black hole, but with a suppression in the efficiency of black
hole growth at early times plausibly caused by supernova feedback, which is
stronger at earlier times. We suggest this picture may be more generally
applicable to black hole growth, and could help explain the strong correlation

z=1.62-1.63 within 2.8 arcmin (<1.4 Mpc) of the astrometric center of the
cluster. A posteriori analysis of the XMM data in this field reveal a weak (4
sigma) detection in the [0.5-2 keV] band compatible with the expected thermal
emission from such a cluster. The color-magnitude diagram of the galaxies in
this cluster shows a prominent red-sequence, dominated by a population of red
galaxies with (z-J) > 1.7 mag. The photometric redshift probability
distributions for the red galaxies are strongly peaked at z=1.62, coincident
with the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. The rest-frame (U-B) color and
scatter of galaxies on the red-sequence are consistent with a mean
luminosity-weighted age of 1.2 +/- 0.1 Gyr, yielding a formation redshift z_f =
2.35 +/- 0.10, and corresponding to the last significant star-formation period
in these galaxies.

fine-grained phase-space structure of galaxy haloes formed from generic LCDM
initial conditions. We integrate the geodesic deviation equation in tandem with
the N-body equations of motion, demonstrating that this can produce numerically
converged results for the properties of fine-grained phase-space streams and
their associated caustics, even in the inner regions of haloes. Our effective
resolution for such structures is many orders of magnitude better than achieved
by conventional techniques on even the largest simulations. We apply these
methods to the six Milky Way-mass haloes of the Aquarius Project. At 8 kpc from
halo centre a typical point intersects about 10^14 streams with a very broad
range of individual densities; the ~10^6 most massive streams contribute about
half of the local dark matter density. As a result, the velocity distribution
of dark matter particles should be very smooth with the most massive
fine-grained stream contributing about 0.1% of the total signal. Dark matter
particles at this radius have typically passed 200 caustics since the Big Bang.
The peak densities on present-day caustics in the inner halo almost all lie
well below the mean local dark matter density. As a result caustics provide a
negligible boost (<0.1%) to the predicted local dark matter annihilation rate.
The effective boost is larger in the outer halo but never exceeds about 10%.
Thus fine-grained streams and their associated caustics have no effect on the
detectability of dark matter, either directly in Earth-bound laboratories, or
indirectly through annihilation radiation, with the exception that resonant
cavity experiments searching for axions may see the most massive local
fine-grained streams because of their extreme localisation in energy/momentum
space. (abridged)

with respect to their host galaxy light distribution. We thus want to
investigate whether WR stars are potential progenitors of stripped-envelope
core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and/or long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs).
Methods: We derived the relative surface brightness (fractional flux) at the
locations of WR stars and compared with similar results for LGRBs and SNe. We
examined two nearby galaxies, M 83 and NGC 1313, for which a comprehensive
study of the WR population exists. These two galaxies contain a sufficiently
large number of WR stars and sample different metallicities. To enable the
comparison, the images of the galaxies were processed to make them appear as
they would look at a higher redshift. The robustness of our results against
several sources of uncertainty was investigated with the aid of Monte Carlo
simulations. Results: We find that the WC star distribution favours brighter
pixels than the WN star population. WC stars are more likely drawn from the
same distribution as SNe Ic than from other SN distributions, while WN stars
show a higher degree of association with SNe Ib. It can also not be excluded
that WR (especially WC) stars are related to LGRBs. Some differences between
the two galaxies do exist, especially in the subtype distributions, and may
stem from differences in metallicity. Conclusions: Although a conclusive answer
is not possible, the expectation that WR stars are the progenitors of SNe Ib/c
and LGRBs survives this test. The trend observed between the distributions of
WN and WC stars, as compared to those of SNe Ib and Ic, is consistent with the
theoretical picture that SNe Ic result from progenitors that have been stripped
of a larger part of their envelope.

stabilizes $(\pi,0)$ stripe antiferromagnetism due to emergent ferro-orbital

account, we calculate the magnetic excitation spectra in the presence of both,
super- and double-exchange. A dramatic increase of the spin-wave energies at
the competing N\'eel ordering wave vector is found, in agreement with recent
neutron scattering data. The spectra are fitted to a spin-only model with a
strong spatial anisotropy and additional longer ranged couplings along the
ferromagnetic chains. Over a realistic parameter range, the effective couplings
along the chains are negative corresponding to unfrustrated stripe
antiferromagnetism.

luminosity, H-band luminosity, and HI gas mass. We visually assign bars using
the high resolution H-band imaging from UKIDSS. When all morphologies are
included, the barred fraction is ~17-24% while for morphologically selected
discs, we find that the barred fraction in Virgo is ~29-34%: it does not depend
strongly on how the sample is defined and does not show variations with
luminosity or HI gas mass. The barred fraction depends most strongly on the
morphological composition of the sample: when the disc populations are
separated into lenticulars (S0--S0/a), early-type spirals (Sa--Sb), and
late-type spirals (Sbc--Sm), we find that the early-type spirals have a higher
barred fraction (~45-50%) compared to the lenticulars and late-type spirals
(~22-36%). This difference may be due to the higher baryon fraction of
early-type discs which makes them more susceptible to bar instabilities. We do

probabilities for stars with stellar inclination constraints, considering a
reasonable range of planetary system inclinations. We find that stellar
inclination constraints can improve the transit probability by almost an order
of magnitude for habitable-zone planets. When applied to an ensemble of stars,
such constraints dramatically lower the number of stars that need to be
observed in a targeted transit survey. We also consider multiplanet systems
where only one planet has an identified transit, and derive the transit
probabilities for the second planet assuming a range of mutual planetary
inclinations.

[8.5<log(M*/Msun)< 9.5] at 0.89 < z < 1.15 drawn from two extremely deep fields
(GOODS-S and MS1054-FIRES). Using the [OII]3727 emission line, we obtain
redshifts and star-formation rates (SFRs) for star-forming galaxies down to a
limit of ~0.3 Msun/yr. We present the [OII] luminosity function measured in
ROLES and find a faint end slope of alpha_faint ~ -1.5, similar to that
measured at z~0.1 in the SDSS. By combining ROLES with higher mass surveys, we
measure the SFRD as a function of stellar mass using [OII] (with and without
various empirical corrections), and using SED-fitting to obtain the SFR from
the rest-frame UV luminosity for galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. Our
best estimate of the corrected [OII]-SFRD and UV SFRD both independently show
that the SFRD evolves equally for galaxies of all masses between z~1 and z~0.1.
The exact evolution in normalisation depends on the indicator used, with the
[OII]-based estimate showing a change of a factor of ~2.6 and the UV-based a
factor of ~6. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy in normalisation
between the indicators, but note that the magnitude of this uncertainty is
comparable to the discrepancy between indicators seen in other z~1 works. Our
result that the shape of the SFRD as a function of stellar mass (and hence the
mass range of galaxies dominating the SFRD) does not evolve between z~1 and
z~0.1 is robust to the choice of indicator. [abridged]

require a particularly large or sensitive extinction correction, yet yields
results broadly consistent with more observationally expensive methods. We
suggest that the [OII]-derived SFR, commonly used at higher redshifts (z~1),
can be used to reliably estimate SFRs for ensembles of galaxies, but for high
mass galaxies (log(M*/Msun)>10), a larger correction than is typically used is
required to compensate for the effects of metallicity dependence and dust

elemental abundance gradient evolves with cosmic time, a phenomenon that was
not foreseen in existing models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). If the
phenomenon is confirmed in future studies, we show that this effect, at least
in part, is due to large-scale winds that once enriched the disk. These set up
the steep abundance gradient in the inner disk (R <14 kpc). At the close of the
wind phase, chemical enrichment through accretion of metal-poor material from
the halo onto the disk gradually reduced the metallicity of the inner region,
whereas a slow increase in the metallicity proceeded beyond the solar circle.
Our ""wind+infall"" model accounts for flattening of the abundance gradient in
the inner disk, in good agreement with observations. Accordingly, we propose
that enrichment by large-scale winds is a crucial factor for chemical evolution
in the disk. We anticipate that rapid flattening of the abundance gradient is
the hallmarks of disk galaxies with significant central bulges.

part of the cavity transitions between the superconducting and normal

demonstrate that the transition to the normal conducting state is global in
nature, showing that a fundamental limit is encountered. Finally, we see that
110-120 C heat treatment of the cavity--a method commonly used to increase the

of reducing the superheating field of the material, which is the fundamental
limiting factor in pursuing the maximal achievable accelerating gradient in

noisy network is presented. For multi-source multicast networks, the scheme
naturally extends both network coding over noiseless networks by Ahlswede, Cai,
Li, and Yeung, and compress-forward coding for the relay channel by Cover and
El Gamal to general discrete memoryless and Gaussian networks. The scheme also
recovers as special cases the results on coding for wireless relay networks and
deterministic networks by Avestimehr, Diggavi, and Tse, and coding for wireless
erasure networks by Dana, Gowaikar, Palanki, Hassibi, and Effros. The scheme
involves message repetition coding, relay signal compression, and simultaneous
decoding. Unlike previous compress--forward schemes, where independent messages
are sent over multiple blocks, the same message is sent multiple times using
independent codebooks as in the network coding scheme for cyclic networks.
Furthermore, the relays do not use Wyner--Ziv binning as in previous
compress-forward schemes, and each decoder performs simultaneous joint
typicality decoding on the received signals from all the blocks without
explicitly decoding the compression indices. A consequence of this new scheme
is that achievability is proved simply and more generally without resorting to
time expansion to extend results for acyclic networks to networks with cycles.
The noisy network coding scheme is then extended to general multi-source
networks by combining it with decoding techniques for interference channels.
For the Gaussian multicast network, noisy network coding improves the
previously established gap to the cutset bound. We also demonstrate through two
popular AWGN network examples that noisy network coding can outperform
conventional compress-forward, amplify-forward, and hash-forward schemes.

channels where the noises at the relay and destination are arbitrarily
correlated. We first derive the capacity upper bound and the achievable rates
with three existing schemes: Decode-and-Forward (DF), Compress-and-Forward
(CF), and Amplify-and-Forward (AF). We present two capacity results under
specific noise correlation coefficients, one being achieved by DF and the other
being achieved by direct link transmission (or a special case of CF). The
channel for the former capacity result is equivalent to the traditional
Gaussian degraded relay channel and the latter corresponds to the Gaussian
reversely-degraded relay channel. For CF and AF schemes, we show that their
achievable rates are strictly decreasing functions over the negative
correlation coefficient. Through numerical comparisons under different channel
settings, we observe that although DF completely disregards the noise
correlation while the other two can potentially exploit such extra information,
none of the three relay schemes always outperforms the others over different
correlation coefficients. Moreover, the exploitation of noise correlation by CF
and AF accrues more benefit when the source-relay link is weak. This paper also
considers the optimal power allocation problem under the correlated-noise
channel setting. With individual power constraints at the relay and the source,
it is shown that the relay should use all its available power to maximize the
achievable rates under any correlation coefficient. With a total power
constraint across the source and the relay, the achievable rates are proved to
be concave functions over the power allocation factor for AF and CF under
full-duplex mode, where the closed-form power allocation strategy is derived.

harmonic oscillator in a box is used to introduce the concept of an
oblique-basis shell-model theory. By implementing the Lanczos method for
diagonalization of large matrices, and the Cholesky algorithm for solving
generalized eigenvalue problems, the method is applied to nuclei. The
mixed-symmetry basis combines traditional spherical shell-model states with
SU(3) collective configurations. We test the validity of this mixed-symmetry
scheme on 24Mg and 44Ti. Results for 24Mg, obtained using the Wilthental USD
intersection in a space that spans less than 10% of the full-space, reproduce
the binding energy within 2% as well as an accurate reproduction of the
low-energy spectrum and the structure of the states - 90% overlap with the
exact eigenstates. In contrast, for an m-scheme calculation, one needs about
60% of the full space to obtain compatible results. Calculations for 44Ti
support the mixed-mode scheme although the pure SU(3) calculations with few
irreps are not as good as the standard m-scheme calculations. The strong
breaking of the SU(3) symmetry results in relatively small enhancements within
the combined basis. However, an oblique-basis calculation in 50% of the full
pf-shell space is as good as a usual m-scheme calculation in 80% of the space.
Results for the lower pf-shell nuclei 44-48Ti and 48Cr, using the Kuo-Brown-3
interaction, show that SU(3) symmetry breaking in this region is driven by the
single-particle spin-orbit splitting. In our study we observe some interesting
coherent structures, such as coherent mixing of basis states,
quasi-perturbative behavior in the toy model, and enhanced B(E2) strengths
close to the SU(3) limit even though SU(3) appears to be rather badly broken.

vectors of successive barycentric subdivisions of X have roots which converge
to fixed values depending only on the dimension of X. We improve and generalize
this result here. We begin with an alternative proof based on geometric
intuition. We then prove an interesting symmetry of these roots about the real
number -2. This symmetry can be seen via a nice algebraic realization of
barycentric subdivision as a simple map on formal power series in two
variables. Finally, we use this algebraic machinery with some geometric
motivation to generalize the combinatorial statements to arbitrary subdivision
methods: any subdivision method will exhibit similar limit behavior and
symmetry. Our techniques allow us to compute explicit formulas for the values
of the limit roots in the case of barycentric subdivision.

This phenomenon occurs in liquids of all classes, most recently in bulk

smaller-scale fluctuations. (ii) The probability distribution of eddy

of available snapshots and the observation dimension are comparable in
magnitude. In this context, traditional subspace methods tend to fail because
the eigenvectors of the sample correlation matrix are heavily biased with
respect to the true ones. It has recently been suggested that this situation
(where the sample size is small compared to the observation dimension) can be
very accurately modeled by considering the asymptotic regime where the
observation dimension $M$ and the number of snapshots $N$ converge to $+\infty$
at the same rate. Using large random matrix theory results, it can be shown
that traditional subspace estimates are not consistent in this asymptotic
regime. Furthermore, new consistent subspace estimate can be proposed, which
outperform the standard subspace methods for realistic values of $M$ and $N$.
The work carried out so far in this area has always been based on the
assumption that the observations are random, independent and identically
distributed in the time domain. The goal of this paper is to propose new
consistent subspace estimators for the case where the source signals are
modelled as unknown deterministic signals. In practice, this allows to use the
proposed approach regardless of the statistical properties of the source
signals. In order to construct the proposed estimators, new technical results
concerning the almost sure location of the eigenvalues of sample covariance
matrices of Information plus Noise complex Gaussian models are established.
These results are believed to be of independent interest.

Barabanov norms was the key instrument in disproving the Lagarias-Wang

study of the geometrical properties of the unit balls of some specific
Barabanov norms. In this context the situation when one fails to find among
current publications any detailed analysis of the geometrical properties of the
unit balls of Barabanov norms looks a bit paradoxical. Partially this is
explained by the fact that Barabanov norms are defined nonconstructively, by an
implicit procedure. So, even in simplest cases it is very difficult to
visualize the shape of their unit balls. The present work may be treated as the
first step to make up this deficiency. In the paper an iteration procedure is
considered that allows to build numerically Barabanov norms for the irreducible
matrix sets and simultaneously to compute the joint spectral radius of these

expansion history of the universe, the form of the linear theory power spectrum
and can alter key observables, such as the horizon scale and the distance to
last scattering. The difference in structure formation can be explained to
first order by the difference in growth factor at a given epoch; this scaling
also accounts for the nonlinear growth at the 15% level. We find that
quintessence models which feature late $(z<2)$, rapid transitions towards
$w=-1$ in the equation of state, can have identical baryonic acoustic
oscillation (BAO) peak positions to those in $\Lambda$CDM, despite being very
different from $\Lambda$CDM both today and at high redshifts $(z \sim 1000)$.
We find that a second class of models which feature non-negligible amounts of

measurements of the mass function or the BAO. These results highlight the need
to accurately model quintessence dark energy in N-body simulations when testing

with v_circ < 40 km/s, as well as stellar feedback that drives gas out of
haloes mainly with v_circ < 120 km/s. We run our model on the merger trees of
the haloes and subhaloes of a high-resolution dark matter cosmological
simulation. The galaxy mass is taken as the maximum between the mass given by
the model and the sum of the masses of its progenitors (reduced by tidal
stripping). Designed to reproduce the present-day stellar mass function of
galaxies, our model matches fairly well the evolution of the cosmic stellar
density. It leads to the same z=0 relation between central galaxy stellar and
halo mass as the one found by abundance matching and also as that previously
measured at high mass on SDSS centrals. Our model also predicts a bimodal
distribution (centrals and satellites) of stellar masses for given halo mass,
in good agreement with SDSS observations. The relative importance of mergers
depends much more on stellar than halo mass. Galaxies with m_stars > 10^11
M_Sun/h acquire most of their mass through mergers (mostly major and gas-poor),
as expected from our model's shutdown of gas accretion at high M_halo. However,
mergers are rare for m_stars < 10^11 M_Sun/h (greater than our mass
resolution), a consequence of the curvature of the stellar vs. halo mass
relation. So gas accretion must be the dominant growth mechanism for
intermediate and low mass galaxies, e.g. dwarf ellipticals in clusters, except
that gas-rich galaxy mergers account for the bulk of the growth of ellipticals
with m_stars ~ 10^10.5 M_Sun/h, which we predict must be the typical mass of
ULIRGs.

rotation. The studied robot has 8 DOF in the single support phase and 6
actuators. The interest of studying robots with point feet is that the robot's
natural dynamics must be explicitly taken into account to achieve balance while
walking. We use an extension of the method of virtual constraints and hybrid
zero dynamics, in order to simultaneously compute a periodic orbit and an
autonomous feedback controller that realizes the orbit. This method allows the
computations to be carried out on a 2-DOF subsystem of the 8-DOF robot model.
The stability of the walking gait under closed-loop control is evaluated with
the linearization of the restricted Poincar\'e map of the hybrid zero dynamics.
Three strategies are explored. The first strategy consists of imposing a
stability condition during the search of a periodic gait by optimization. The
second strategy uses an event-based controller. In the third approach, the
effect of output selection is discussed and a pertinent choice of outputs is
proposed, leading to stabilization without the use of a supplemental
event-based controller.

generation of porous packings of spherical particles over a wide range of

particles under addition of much smaller ""void-particles"" whose radii are
repeatedly increased during the void expansion. Thereby, they rearrange the
structural particles until formation of a dense particle packing and introduce
local heterogeneities in the structure. In this paper, microstructures with
volume fractions between 0.4 and 0.6 produced by VEM are analyzed with respect
to their degree of heterogeneity (DOH). In particular, the influence of the
void- to structural particle number ratio, which constitutes a principal
VEM-parameter, on the DOH is studied. The DOH is quantified using the pore size
distribution, the Voronoi volume distribution and the density-fluctuation
method in conjunction with fit functions or integral measures. This analysis
has revealed that for volume fractions between 0.4 and 0.55 the void-particle
number allows for a quasi-continuous adjustment of the DOH. Additionally, the
DOH-range of VEM-generated microstructures with a volume fraction of 0.4 is
compared to the range covered by microstructures generated using previous
Brownian dynamics simulations, which represent the structure of coagulated
colloidal suspensions. Both sets of microstructures cover similarly broad and
overlapping DOH-ranges, which allows concluding that VEM is an efficient method
to stochastically reproduce colloidal microstructures with varying DOH.

subset polymers our sharper criterion can be proven both by a suitable
adaptation of Dobrushin inductive argument and by an alternative --in fact,
more elementary-- handling of the Kirkwood-Salzburg equations. In addition we
show that for general abstract polymers this alternative treatment leads to the

long-range interactions. Starting from the BBGKY hierarchy, or using projection
operator technics or a quasilinear theory, a general kinetic equation can be
derived when collective effects are neglected. This equation (which is not
well-known) applies to possibly spatially inhomogeneous systems, which is
specific to systems with long-range interactions. Interestingly, the structure
of this kinetic equation bears a clear physical meaning in terms of generalized
Kubo relations. Furthermore, this equation takes a very similar form for
stellar systems and two-dimensional point vortices providing therefore a
unified description of the kinetic theory of these systems. If we assume that
the system is spatially homogeneous (or axisymmetric for point vortices), this
equation can be simplified and reduces to the Landau equation (or its
counterpart for point vortices). Our formalism thus offers a simple derivation
of Landau-type equations. We also use this general formalism to derive a
kinetic equation, written in angle-action variables, describing spatially
inhomogeneous systems with long-range interactions. This new derivation solves
the shortcomings of our previous derivation [P.H. Chavanis, Physica A 377, 469
(2007)]. Finally, we consider a test particle approach and derive general

size-invariant symmetrical cooperation effect. While generally suppressing
cooperation for $r>0.5$ payoffs, rewired networks facilitated cooperative
behavior for $r<0.5$. Fair amounts of noise were found to break the observed
symmetry and further weaken cooperation at relatively large values of $r$.
However, in the absence of noise, the self-questioning mechanism recovers
symmetrical behavior and elevates altruism even under large-reward conditions.
Our results suggest that an updating mechanism of this type is necessary to
stabilize cooperation in a spatially structured environment which is otherwise
detrimental to cooperative behavior, especially at high cost-to-benefit ratios.
Additionally, we employ component and local stability analyses to better
understand the nature of the manifested dynamics.

solve the corresponding master equation in the Lindblad form. Our results show
that the spontaneous emission associated with the direct exciton helps to build

potential applications in quantum memories and quantum gate architectures. We
further investigate several regimes of physical parameters, showing that this
process is easily controlled by tuning of external fields.

do phase difference spectra always pull to 0 degrees phase lag at high

the atmospheric MTF of high frequency waves? How reliably can we determine the
energy flux of high frequency waves? We address these questions by comparing
observations obtained with Hinode/NFI with results from two 3D numerical
simulations (Oslo Stagger and CO5BOLD). Our results suggest that the observed
high frequency Doppler velocity signal is caused by rapid height variations of
the velocity response function in an atmosphere with strong velocity gradients

with caution, in particular those that apply atmospheric MTF corrections.

generically degree-degree anticorrelated, i.e. disassortative? With a view to
answering this long-standing question, we define a general class of
degree-degree correlated networks and obtain the associated Shannon entropy as
a function of parameters. It turns out that the maximum entropy does not
typically correspond to uncorrelated networks, but to either assortative
(correlated) or disassortative (anticorrelated) ones. More specifically, for
highly heterogeneous (scale-free) networks, the maximum entropy principle
usually leads to disassortativity, providing a parsimonious explanation to the
question above. Furthermore, by comparing the correlations measured in some
real-world networks with those yielding maximum entropy for the same degree
sequence, we find a remarkable agreement in various cases. Our approach
provides a neutral model from which, in the absence of further knowledge
regarding network evolution, one can obtain the expected value of correlations.
In cases in which empirical observations deviate from the neutral predictions
-- as happens in social networks -- one can then infer that there are specific
correlating mechanisms at work.
