leads to the formation of a power-law density distribution n(r)~r^(-a) that
diverges towards the MBH. For a single mass population, a=7/4 and the flow of
stars is much less than N(<r)/t_r (enclosed number of stars per relaxation
time). This ""zero-flow"" solution is maintained for a multi-mass system for
moderate mass ratios or systems where there are many heavy stars, and slopes of
3/2<a<2 are reached, with steeper slopes for the more massive stars. If the
heavy stars are rare and massive however, the zero-flow limit breaks down and
much steeper distributions are obtained.
  We discuss the physics driving mass-segregation with the use of Fokker-Planck
calculations, and show that steady state is reached in 0.2-0.3 t_r. Since the
relaxation time in the Galactic centre (GC) is t_r ~2-3 * 10^(10) yr, a cusp
should form in less than a Hubble time. The absence of a visible cusp of old
stars in the GC poses a challenge to these models, suggesting that processes
other than two-body relaxation have played a role. We discuss astrophysical
processes within the GC that depend crucially on the details of the stellar
cusp.

range of parameters for which the kinematics can be fitted. We have also taken
into account the use of different type of dynamical modelling and the effect of
using 2-D vs 1-D models in deriving the pattern speeds. We conclude that the
derivation of the bar streaming motions and strength and position of shocks is
not greatly affected by the fluid dynamical model used. We show new results on
the derivation of the pattern speed for NGC 1530. The best fit pattern speed is
around 10 km/s/kpc, which corresponds to a R_cor/R_bar = 1.4, implying a slower
bar than previously derived from more indirect assumptions. With this pattern
speed, the global and most local kinematic features are beautifully reproduced.
However, the simulations fail to reproduce the velocity gradients close to some
bright HII regions in the bar. We have shown from the study of the Halpha
equivalent widths that the HII regions that are located further away from the
bar dust-lane in its leading side, downstream from the main bar dust-lane, are
older than the rest by 1.5-2.5 Myr. In addition, a clear spatial correlation
was found between the location of HII regions, dust spurs on the trailing side

from the chiral limit up to values of interest for lattice studies. In these

non-analyticity at high quark masses. Nevertheless the f_0(600) dependence on
both quark masses is stronger than for the kappa(800) and the vectors. We also
confirm the lattice assumption of quark mass independence of the vector
two-meson coupling that, in contrast, is violated for scalars.

been documented well; however, effects of standardization on medical image

that similarly to CNSs, CNBs formation is dominated by two major energy
contribution, the increase in the elastic energy due to the bending of the

energetic gain due to van der Waals interactions of the overlapping surface of
the rolled layers (increasing structural stability). Beyond a critical diameter
value these scrolled structures can be even more stable (in terms of energy)

assembly. (b) A novel strategy of encoding, via b-scale, the pose relationship
between objects in the training images and their intensity patterns captured in
b-scale images. (c) A hierarchical mechanism of positioning the model, in a

and the b-scale image of the given image to be segmented. The evaluation
results on a set of 20 routine clinical abdominal female and male CT data sets

the recognition accuracy dramatically. (2) The recognition algorithm can be
thought as a hierarchical framework such that quick replacement of the model

finest recognition. (3) Scale yields useful information about the relationship

significantly impact our understanding of the physical processes that shaped
the early Universe. The challenge lies in separating the cosmological signal
from other stochastic processes such as instrument noise and astrophysical
foregrounds. One approach is to build two or more detectors and cross correlate
their output, thereby enhancing the common gravitational wave signal relative
to the uncorrelated instrument noise. When only one detector is available, as
will likely be the case with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA),
alternative analysis techniques must be developed. Here we show that models of
the noise and signal transfer functions can be used to tease apart the
gravitational and instrument noise contributions. We discuss the role of
gravitational wave insensitive ""null channels"" formed from particular
combinations of the time delay interferometry, and derive a new combination
that maintains this insensitivity for unequal arm length detectors. We show
that, in the absence of astrophysical foregrounds, LISA could detect signals
with energy densities as low as $\Omega_{\rm gw} = 6 \times 10^{-13}$ with just

essential for understanding the stochastic nature of tissue cell deformation
under applied load. In the existing literature, the population variation of
single-cell creep compliance has so far been modeled universally by using a
log-normal distribution. Here we use optical stretching, a non-contact and
relatively high-throughput technique for probing cell mechanics, to accumulate
a sufficient data set that demonstrates robustly that cell compliance varies
according to the similar but distinct gamma distribution. Additionally, we
re-examine existing simulations that were originally proposed to justify a
log-normal fit, and show that in fact these simulation data also correspond to
the gamma distribution. Finally, we propose a general stochastic differential
equation that analytically predicts a gamma distribution of creep compliance
during cell stretching, as well as the Gaussian distribution of cell recovery
that we observe experimentally upon removal of applied load. The population
variation is well characterized by just a single parameter in each of the creep
and recovery regimes. We expect our correction of a phenomenological
distribution fit, enabled by an expansive data set for mesenchymal stem cells,
to enable the development of more accurate constitutive laws to describe
cytoskeletal deformation. These findings thus serve to replace an empirical
distribution with a better-fitting model that rests on a more solid
experimental and theoretical foundation, and also provides a basis to predict
and understand the stochastic nature of the mechanical response of individual
cells within populations.

for H, He, C, N, O, Si, and S in the interface. We include photoionization by
an external field. We estimate how departures from equilibrium ionization
affect the resonance-line cooling efficiencies in the evaporating gas, and
determine the conditions for which radiative losses may be neglected in the
solution for the evaporation dynamics and temperature profile. Our results
indicate that non-equilibrium cooling significantly increases the value of the
saturation parameter at which radiative losses begin to affect the flow
dynamics. As applications we calculate the ion fractions and projected column
densities arising in the evaporating layers surrounding dwarf-galaxy-scale
objects that are also photoionized by metagalactic radiation. We compare our
results to the UV metal-absorption column densities observed in local
highly-ionized metal-absorbers, located in the Galactic corona or intergalactic

such as C^3+, N^4+, and O^5+ relative to purely photoionized clouds, especially
for clouds embedded in a high-pressure corona. However, the enhanced columns
are still too low to account for the O VI columns (~1e14 cm^-2) observed in the
local high-velocity absorbers. We find that O VI columns larger than ~1e13

for the efficient computation of neutrino and photon spectra (from pi^0
decays), as a major requirement of modern time-dependent simulations of the
astrophysical sources and parameter studies. In addition, the secondaries
(pions and muons) are explicitely generated, a necessity if cooling processes
are to be included. For the neutrino production, we include the helicity
dependence of the muon decays which in fact leads to larger corrections than
the details of the interaction model. The separate computation of the pi^0,
pi^+, and pi^- fluxes allows, for instance, for flavor ratio predictions of the
neutrinos at the source, which are a requirement of many tests of neutrino
properties using astrophysical sources. We confirm that for charged pion
generation, the often used production by the Delta(1232)-resonance is typically
not the dominant process in Active Galactic Nuclei and Gamma-Ray Bursts, and we
show, for arbitrary input spectra, that the number of neutrinos are
underestimated by at least a factor of two if they are obtained from the

jamming it (Jx mode) -- the active eavesdropper cannot function in full duplex
mode. We consider a conservative scenario, when the active eavesdropper can
choose its strategy based on the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair's
strategy -- and thus the transmitter and legitimate receiver have to plan for
the worst. We show that conventional physical-layer secrecy approaches perform
poorly (if at all), and we introduce a novel encoding scheme, based on very
limited and unsecured feedback -- the Block-Markov Wyner (BMW) encoding scheme
-- which outperforms any schemes currently available.

problem in chemical models. In order to probe the physical conditions of the
ISM in which CH+ forms, we propose the use of CH3+ observations. The pathway to
forming CH3+ begins with CH+, and a steady state analysis of CH3+ and the
reaction intermediary CH2+ results in a relationship between the CH+ and CH3+
abundances. This relationship depends on the molecular hydrogen fraction, f_H2,
and gas temperature, T, so observations of CH+ and CH3+ can be used to infer
the properties of the gas in which both species reside. We present observations
of both molecules along the diffuse cloud sight line toward Cyg OB2 No. 12.
Using our computed column densities and upper limits, we put constraints on the
f_H2 vs. T parameter space in which CH+ and CH3+ form. We find that average,
static, diffuse molecular cloud conditions (i.e. f_H2>0.2, T~60 K) are excluded
by our analysis. However, current theory suggests that non-equilibrium effects
drive the reaction C+ + H_2 --> CH+ + H, endothermic by 4640 K. If we consider
a higher effective temperature due to collisions between neutrals and
accelerated ions, the CH3+ partition function predicts that the overall
population will be spread out into several excited rotational levels. As a
result, observations of more CH3+ transitions with higher signal-to-noise
ratios are necessary to place any constraints on models where magnetic
acceleration of ions drives the formation of CH+.

the interstellar medium of their high-redshift host galaxies. Globular cluster
systems in most large galaxies display bimodal color and metallicity
distributions, which are often interpreted as indicating two distinct modes of
cluster formation. The metal-rich and metal-poor clusters have systematically
different locations and kinematics in their host galaxies. However, the red and
blue clusters have similar internal properties, such as the masses, sizes, and
ages. It is therefore interesting to explore whether both metal-rich and
metal-poor clusters could form by a common mechanism and still be consistent
with the bimodal distribution. We present such a model, which prescribes the
formation of globular clusters semi-analytically using galaxy assembly history
from cosmological simulations coupled with observed scaling relations for the
amount and metallicity of cold gas available for star formation. We assume that
massive star clusters form only during mergers of massive gas-rich galaxies and
tune the model parameters to reproduce the observed distribution in the Galaxy.
A wide, but not entire, range of model realizations produces metallicity
distributions consistent with the data. We find that early mergers of smaller
hosts create exclusively blue clusters, whereas subsequent mergers of more
massive galaxies create both red and blue clusters. Thus bimodality arises
naturally as the result of a small number of late massive merger events. This
conclusion is not significantly affected by the large uncertainties in our
knowledge of the stellar mass and cold gas mass in high-redshift galaxies. The
fraction of galactic stellar mass locked in globular clusters declines from
over 10% at z>3 to 0.1% at present.

field, produced during the initial anisotropic epoch before the onset of
inflation. We consider two models of the anisotropic cosmology, the (planar)
Kasner de Sitter solution (Bianchi I) and the Taub-NUT de Sitter solution
(Bianchi IX), where the 3-space geometry is initially anisotropic, followed by
the de Sitter phase due to the presence of a positive cosmological constant. We
discuss the behavior of a quantized, massless and minimally coupled scalar
field in the anisotropic stage. We focus on the quantization procedure and
evolution in the pre-inflationary anisotropic background. The initial condition
is set by the requirement that the scalar field is initially in an adiabatic
state. In our case, such a vacuum state exists only for limited solutions of
the anisotropic Universe, whose spacetime structure is regular in the initial
times. In this paper, we call our adiabatic vacuum state the anisotropic
vacuum. In the Kasner de Sitter model, for one branch of planar solutions there
is an anisotropic vacuum unless $k_3\neq 0$, where $k_3$ is the comoving
momentum along the third direction, while in the other branch there is no
anisotropic vacuum state. In the first branch, for the moderate modes, $k_3\sim
k$, where $k$ is the total comoving momentum, the scalar power spectrum has an
oscillatory behavior and its direction dependence is suppressed. For the planar
modes, $k_3\ll k$, in contrast, the direction dependence becomes more
important, because of the amplification of the scalar amplitude during this
interval of the violation of WKB approximation in the initial anisotropic
stage. The qualitative behaviors in the Taub-NUT de Sitter models are very
similar to the case of the first branch of the planar Kasner de Sitter model.

reduced graphs (the graphs resulting from iterated removal of sinks) of C have
bounded treewidth. We also give a characterization for PURECHG(C,-), the
problem of deciding the existence of pure Nash equilibria in colored
hypergraphical games, a game representation that can express the additional
structure that some of the players have identical local utility functions. We
show that the tractable classes of bounded-arity colored hypergraphical games
are precisely those whose reduced graphs have bounded treewidth modulo
homomorphic equivalence. Our proofs make novel use of Grohe's characterization
of the complexity of homomorphism problems.

small velocity and weak field) of fourth order gravity models. According to
some authors, the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$-gravity is equivalent to the one of
Brans-Dicke gravity with $\omega_{BD} = 0$, so that the PPN parameters of these
models turn out to be ill defined. In this paper, we carefully discuss this
point considering that fourth order gravity models are dynamically equivalent
to the O'Hanlon Lagrangian. This is a special case of scalar-tensor gravity
characterized only by self-interaction potential and that, in the Newtonian
limit, this implies a non-standard behavior that cannot be compared with the
usual PPN limit of General Relativity.
  The result turns out to be completely different from the one of Brans-Dicke
theory and in particular suggests that it is misleading to consider the PPN
parameters of this theory with $\omega_{BD} = 0$ in order to characterize the
homologous quantities of $f(R)$-gravity. Finally the solutions at Newtonian
level, obtained in the Jordan frame for a $f(R)$-gravity, reinterpreted as a
scalar-tensor theory, are linked to those in the Einstein frame.

cross-correlation power spectrum estimator is found to be unaffected by the
discrete quasar sampling, which only affects the noise in the estimate. We
consider a hypothetical redshifted 21-cm observation in a single field of view
1.3 degrees (FWHM) centered at z=2.2 where the binned 21-cm angular power
spectrum can be measured at an SNR of 3 sigma or better across the range 500 <
l < 4000 . Keeping the parameters of the 21-cm observation fixed, we have
estimated the SNR for the cross-correlation signal varying the quasar angular
number density n of the Ly-alpha forest survey. Assuming that the spectra have
SNR ~5 in pixels of length 44 km/s, we find that a 5 sigma detection of the
cross-correlation signal is possible at 600 < l < 2000 with n=4 deg^{-2}. This
value of n is well within the reach of upcoming Ly-alpha forest surveys. The

properties of dark matter haloes. The magnification of individual SNe Ia can be
computed using observed properties of foreground galaxies and dark matter halo
models. We model the dark matter haloes of the galaxies as truncated singular
isothermal spheres with velocity dispersion and truncation radius obeying
luminosity dependent scaling laws. A homogeneously selected sample of 175 SNe
Ia from the first 3-years of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) in the redshift
range 0.2 < z < 1 is used to constrain models of the dark matter haloes
associated with foreground galaxies. The best-fitting velocity dispersion
scaling law agrees well with galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. We further
find that the normalisation of the velocity dispersion of passive and star
forming galaxies are consistent with empirical Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher
relations, respectively. If we make no assumption on the normalisation of these
relations, we find that the data prefer gravitational lensing at the 92 per
cent confidence level. Using recent models of dust extinction we deduce that
the impact of this effect on our results is very small. We also investigate the
brightness scatter of SNe Ia due to gravitational lensing. The gravitational
lensing scatter is approximately proportional to the SN Ia redshift. We find
the constant of proportionality to be B = 0.055 +0.039 -0.041 mag (B < 0.12 mag
at the 95 per cent confidence level). If this model is correct, the
contribution from lensing to the intrinsic brightness scatter of SNe Ia is
small for the SNLS sample.

due to Doppler boosting effects in relativistic, intrinsically symmetric jets;
two-sided morphology in cool core clusters is likely related to the presence of
heavy and mildly relativistic jets slowed down on the parsec-scale. Evidence of
recurrent activity are also found in BCGs in cool core clusters.

A, in press",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.81.033805",,"nlin.PS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  We study two-dimensional (2D) matter-wave gap solitons trapped in an
elliptically deformed concentric lattice potential, within the framework of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with self-attraction or self-repulsion. For a
fixed eccentricity of the lattice, soliton families are found in both the
repulsive and attractive models. In the former case, the analysis reveals two
kinds of gap solitons trapped in the first oval trough (the ring-shaped
potential minimum closest to the center): elliptic annular solitons (EASs), and
double solitons (DSs), which are formed by two tightly localized density peaks
located at diametrically opposite points of the trough, with zero phase
difference between them. With the decrease of the norm, the density
distribution in the EAS along the azimuthal direction changes from
nearly-uniform to double-peaked and, eventually, to the DS. In the attractive
model, there exist only DSs in the oval trough, while EASs are not found. All
such solitons without the angular momentum (l = 0) are fully stable. For l is
not equal to 0, vortical solitons - both EASs with a sufficiently large norm
(in the repulsive model) and DSs (in models with both signs of the
nonlinearity) - are quasi-stable, exhibiting rocking motion in the elliptic
trough (we consider the cases of l=1 and l=2). At smaller values of the norm,
the vortical annular solitons (in the repulsive model) are unstable. Stable
fundamental solitons trapped in the central potential well are investigated
too, in both the attractive and repulsive models, by means of the variational
approximation and numerical methods.

programmable way, nonclassical correlations in a multipartite quantum system.
Linear optics quantum computation (LOQC) is an approach for achieving this
function that requires only simple, reliable linear optical elements, namely
beam splitters and phase shifters. Nonlinear optics is only required in the
form of single-photon sources for state initialization, and detectors. However,
the latter remain difficult to achieve with high fidelity. A new setting for
quantum optics has arisen in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) using
superconducting (SC) quantum devices, and opening up the way to LOQC using
microwave, rather than visible photons. Much progress is being made in SC
qubits and cQED: high-fidelity Fock state generation and qubit measurements
provide single photon sources and detection. Here we show that the LOQC toolkit
in cQED can be completed with high-fidelity (>99.92%) linear optical elements.

the two-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws for an ideal compressible gas.
It is proved that the contact discontinuity in the plane-wave Riemann problem
is unstable under perturbations. The implications for Godunovs method are
discussed and it is shown that numerical post shock noise can set of a contact
instability. A relation to carbuncle instabilities is established.

between successive trading volumes exceeding a certain threshold $q$. The
recurrence interval analysis is carried out for the 20 liquid Chinese stocks
covering a period from January 2000 to May 2009, and two Chinese indices from
January 2003 to April 2009. Similar to the recurrence interval distribution of
the price returns, the tail of the recurrence interval distribution of the
trading volumes follows a power-law scaling, and the results are verified by
the goodness-of-fit tests using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic, the
weighted KS statistic and the Cram{\'{e}}r-von Mises criterion. The
measurements of the conditional probability distribution and the detrended
fluctuation function show that both short-term and long-term memory effects
exist in the recurrence intervals between trading volumes. We further study the
relationship between trading volumes and price returns based on the recurrence
interval analysis method. It is found that large trading volumes are more
likely to occur following large price returns, and the comovement between
trading volumes and price returns is more pronounced for large trading volumes.
