colliders near the hadronic endpoint have largely focused on simple final
states with either no jets (e.g., Drell-Yan) or one inclusive jet (e.g., deep
inelastic scattering and prompt photon production). Factorization for the
former type of process gives rise to a soft function that depends on timelike
momenta, whereas the soft function for the latter type depends on null momenta.
We derive in soft-collinear effective theory a factorization theorem that
allows for an arbitrary number of jets, where the jets are defined with respect
to a jet algorithm, together with any number of non-strongly interacting
particles. We find the soft function in general depends on the null components
of the soft momenta inside the jets and on a timelike component of the soft
momentum outside of the jets. This generalizes and interpolates between the
soft functions for the cases of no jets and one inclusive jet. We verify
consistency of our factorization theorem to order alpha_s for any number of
jets. While in this paper we demonstrate consistency only near the hadronic
endpoint, we keep the kinematics general enough (in particular allowing for
nonzero boost) to allow for an extension to partonic threshold resummation away
from the hadronic endpoint.

state, but also through its microphysics, characterized by the sound speed of
perturbations to the dark energy density and pressure. As the sound speed drops
below the speed of light, dark energy inhomogeneities increase, affecting both
CMB and matter power spectra. We show that current data can put no significant
constraints on the value of the sound speed when dark energy is purely a recent
phenomenon, but can begin to show more interesting results for early dark
energy models. For example, the best fit model for current data has a slight
preference for dynamics (w(a)\ne-1), degrees of freedom distinct from
quintessence (c_s\ne1), and early presence of dark energy (Omega_
de(a<<1)\ne0). Future data may open a new window on dark energy by measuring
its spatial as well as time variation.

an interacting region (two sites with inter-site repulsion U and inter-site
hopping td, coupled to leads by hopping terms tc). Using the numerical
renormalization group for the particle-hole symmetric case, we study the
quantum conductance g as a function of the inter-site hopping td. The
interacting region, which is perfectly reflecting when td -> 0 or td ->
infinity, becomes perfectly transmitting if td takes an intermediate value
\tau(U,tc) which defines the characteristic energy of this interacting model.
When td < tc sqrt(U), g is given by a universal function of the dimensionless
ratio X=td/\tau. This universality characterizes the non-interacting regime
where \tau=tc^2, the perturbative regime (U < tc^2) where \tau can be obtained
using Hartree-Fock theory, and the non-perturbative regime (U > tc^2) where
\tau is twice the characteristic temperature TK of an orbital Kondo effect
induced by the inversion symmetry. When td < \tau, the expression
g(X)=4/(X+1/X)^2 valid without interaction describes also the conductance in
the presence of the interaction. To obtain those results, we map this spinless
model onto an Anderson model with spins, where the quantum impurity is at the
end point of a semi-infinite 1D lead and where td plays the role of a magnetic
field h. This allows us to describe g(td) using exact results obtained for the
magnetization m(h) of the Anderson model at zero temperature. We expect this
universal scaling to be valid also in models with 2D leads, and observable

the scalars, spinors, four-vectors and field strength tensors that they act on.
These simplifications occur because the representations can be found in the

meant to tie everything into the Dixon algebra:
$\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}$, the tensor

Holomorphic maps with three branch points are related, by Belyi's theorem, to

Correlators of multi-matrix models are mapped to the counting of triples of
permutations subject to equivalences defined by subgroups of the permutation
groups. This is related to colorings of the edges of the Grothendieck Dessins.

interpret our data using two different atmospheric models for hot Jupiters.
  Results. Although a weak candidate signal appears near the most probable
radial velocity amplitude, its statistical significance is insufficient for us
to claim a detection. However, this feature agrees very well with a completely
independently obtained result by another research group, which searched for
reflected light from Tau Boo b. As a consequence of the non-detection of

and Hgamma of the spectrum of the symbiotic binary Z And were performed during
its small-amplitude brightening at the end of 2002. The profiles of the
hydrogen lines were double-peaked. These profiles give a reason to suppose that
the lines can be emitted mainly by an optically thin accretion disc. The Halpha
line is strongly contaminated by the emission of the envelope, therefore for
consideration of accretion disc properties we use the Hgamma line. The Halpha
line had broad wings which are supposed to be determined mostly from radiation
damping but high velocity stellar wind from the compact object in the system
can also contribute to their appearance. The Hgamma line had a broad emission
component which is assumed to be emitted mainly from the inner part of the
accretion disc. The line He II 4686 had a broad emission component too, but it
is supposed to appear in a region of a high velocity stellar wind. The outer
radius of the accretion disc can be calculated from the shift between the
peaks. Assuming, that the orbit inclination can ranges from 47$^\circ$ to
76$^\circ$, we estimate the outer radius as 20 - 50 R_sun. The behaviour of the
observed lines can be considered in the framework of the model proposed for
interpretation of the line spectrum during the major 2000 - 2002 brightening of
this binary.

the transient can be described by a 0.225 keV black body with a luminosity of

For a massless scalar field the uniform limit is sufficient to describe the

for the scaling solutions of massive scalars. On a qualitative level scalar

gives rise to a cohomology theory. Similarly each open stable differential
relation $R$ imposed on smooth maps of manifolds determines cohomology theories
$k^*$ and $h^*$; the cohomology theory $k^*$ describes invariants of solutions
of $R$, while $h^*$ describes invariants of so-called stable formal solutions
of $R$. We prove the bordism version of the h-principle: The cohomology
theories $k^*$ and $h^*$ are equivalent for a fairly arbitrary open stable
differential relation $R$. Furthermore, we determine the homotopy type of
$h^*$. Thus, we show that for a fairly arbitrary open stable differential
relation $R$, the machinery of stable homotopy theory can be applied to perform
explicit computations and determine invariants of solutions.
  In the case of the differential relation whose solutions are all maps, our
construction amounts to the Pontrjagin-Thom construction. In the case of the
covering differential relation our result is equivalent to the
Barratt-Priddy-Quillen theorem asserting that the direct limit of classifying
spaces $B\Sigma_n$ of permutation groups $\Sigma_n$ of finite sets of n
elements is homology equivalent to each path component of the infinite loop
space $\Omega^{\infty}S^{\infty}$. In the case of the submersion differential
relation imposed on maps of dimension $d=2$ the cohomology theories $k^*$ and
$h^*$ are not equivalent. Nevertheless, our methods still apply and can be used
to recover the Madsen-Weiss theorem (the Mumford Conjecture).

cataloged using HI data mapped in 2 km/s intervals and these pairs show a
typical offset of 0.8 degrees. A large-scale statistical test for a direct
association is carried out that casts little additional light on whether the
these small offsets are merely coincidental or carry information. To pursue the
issue further, the nature of several of the features within the foreground HI
most closely associated with WMAP structure are examined in detail and it is
shown that the cross-correlation coefficient for well-matched pairs of

electrons in unresolved density enhancements in interstellar space could
theoretically produce high-frequency radio continuum radiation at the levels
observed by WMAP and that such emission will appear nearly flat across the WMAP
frequency range. Evidence for such structure in the interstellar medium already
exists in the literature. Until higher angular resolution observations of the
high-frequency continuum emission structure as well as the apparently
associated HI structure become available, it may be difficult to rule out the

Ni and 21 neutron-capture elements. We made use of CO^5BOLD 3D hydrodynamical

J1036+1212 belongs to the class CEMP-no/s, with enhanced Ba, but deficient Sr,
of which it is the third member discovered to date. Radial-velocity variations
have been observed in SDSS J1349-0229, providing evidence that it is a member
of a binary system. The chemical composition of the three stars is generally
compatible with mass transfer from an AGB companion. However, many details
remain difficult to explain. Most notably of those are the abundance of Li at
the level of the Spite plateau in SDSS J1036+1212 and the large over-abundance
of the pure r-process element Eu in all three stars.

barrier. It is shown that the barrier acts as an effective beam splitter which
builds up the transmitted pulse from the copies of the initial envelope shifted
in the coordinate space backwards relative to the free propagation. Although
along each pathway causality is explicitly obeyed, in special cases reshaping
can result an overall reduction of the initial envelope, accompanied by an
arbitrary coordinate shift. In the case of a high barrier the delay amplitude
distribution (DAD) mimics a Dirac $\delta$-function, the transmission amplitude
is superoscillatory for finite momenta and tunnelling leads to an accurate
advancement of the (reduced) initial envelope by the barrier width. In the case
of a wide barrier, initial envelope is accurately translated into the complex
coordinate plane. The complex shift, given by the first moment of the DAD,
accounts for both the displacement of the maximum of the transmitted
probability density and the increase in its velocity. It is argued that
analysing apparent 'superluminality' in terms of spacial displacements helps
avoid contradiction associated with time parameters such as the phase time.

Astronomy and Astrophysics, submitted",,"10.1051/0004-6361/200913624",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We developed an automated procedure for the identification of transient
brightenings in images from the X-ray telescope on-board Hinode taken with an
Al Poly filter in the equatorial coronal holes, polar coronal holes, and the
quiet Sun with and without transient coronal holes. We found that in comparison
to the quiet Sun, the boundaries of coronal holes are abundant with brightening
events including areas inside the coronal holes where closed magnetic field
structures are present. The visual analysis of these brightenings revealed that
around 70% of them in equatorial, polar and transient coronal holes and their
boundaries show expanding loop structures and/or collimated outflows. In the
quiet Sun only 30% of the brightenings show flows with most of them appearing
to be contained in the solar corona by closed magnetic field lines. This
strongly suggests that magnetic reconnection of co-spatial open and closed
magnetic field lines creates the necessary conditions for plasma outflows to
large distances. The ejected plasma always originates from pre-existing or
newly emerging (at X-ray temperatures) bright points. The present study
confirms our findings that the evolution of loop structures known as coronal
bright points is associated with the small-scale changes of coronal hole
boundaries. The loop structures show an expansion and eruption with the trapped
plasma consequently escaping along the ""quasi"" open magnetic field lines. These
ejections appear to be triggered by magnetic reconnection, e.g. the so-called
interchange reconnection between the closed magnetic field lines (BPs) and the
open magnetic field lines of the coronal holes. We suggest that these plasma
outflows are possibly one of the sources of the slow solar wind.

current solar activity minimum (from September 21, 2006, Carrington rotation
(CR) 2048, until June 26, 2009 (CR 2084)) were analyzed using {\it SOHO}/EIT
and STEREO-A SECCHI EUVI data. From both the observations and Potential Field
Source Surface (PFSS) modeling, we find that the area occupied by CHs inside a
belt of $\pm 40^\circ$ around the solar equator is larger in the current 2007
solar minimum relative to the similar phase of the previous 1996 solar minimum.
The enhanced CH area is related to a recurrent appearance of five persistent
CHs, which survived during 7-27 solar rotations. Three of the CHs are of
positive magnetic polarity and two are negative. The most long-lived CH was
being formed during 2 days and existed for 27 rotations. This CH was associated
with fast solar wind at 1 AU of approximately 620$\pm 40$ km s$^{-1}$. The 3D
MHD modeling for this time period shows an open field structure above this CH.
We conclude that the global magnetic field of the Sun possessed a multi-pole
structure during this time period. Calculation of the harmonic power spectrum
of the solar magnetic field demonstrates a greater prevalence of multi-pole
components over the dipole component in the 2007 solar minimum compared to the
1996 solar minimum. The unusual large separation between the dipole and
multi-pole components is due to the very low magnitude of the dipole component,
which is three times lower than that in the previous 1996 solar minimum.

problems and suffers a poor performance when the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol is
used in multihop ad hoc networks. Many of the problems result from medium
contention at the MAC layer. In this paper, I first illustrate that severe
medium contention and congestion are intimately coupled, and TCP s congestion
control algorithm becomes too coarse in its granularity, causing throughput
instability and excessively long delay. Further, we illustrate TCP s severe
unfairness problem due to the medium contention and the tradeoff between
aggregate throughput and fairness. Then, based on the novel use of channel
busyness ratio, a more accurate metric to characterize the network utilization
and congestion status, I propose a new wireless congestion control protocol
(WCCP) to efficiently and fairly support the transport service in multihop ad
hoc networks. In this protocol, each forwarding node along a traffic flow
exercises the internode and intranode fair resource allocation and determines
the MAC layer feedback accordingly. The endtoend feedback, which is ultimately
determined by the bottleneck node along the flow, is carried back to the source
to control its sending rate. Extensive simulations show that WCCP significantly
outperforms traditional TCP in terms of channel utilization, delay, and
fairness, and eliminates the starvation problem.

fundamental components for IEEE 802.11 based Wireless Local Area Networks

contention level, Upon each packet collision, a station doubles its CW to
reduce further collision of packets. IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination
Function (DCF) suffers from a common problem in erroneous channel. They cannot
distinguish noise lost packets from collision lost packets. In both situations
a station does not receive its ACK and doubles the CW to reduce further packet
collisions. This increases backoff overhead unnecessarily in addition to the
noise lost packets, reduces the throughput significantly. Furthermore, the
aggregate throughput of a practical WLAN strongly depends on the channel
conditions. In real radio environment, the received signal power at the access
point from a station is subjected to deterministic path loss, shadowing and
fast multipath fading. In this paper, we propose a new saturation throughput

To alleviate the low performance of IEEE 802.11 DCF, we introduce a mechanism
that greatly outperforms under noisy environment with low network traffic and

For this instability, the CRs streaming ahead of SNR shock fronts drive
electromagnetic waves with wavelengths much shorter than the typical CR Larmor
radius, by inducing a current parallel to the background magnetic field. We
explore the nonlinear regime of the non-resonant mode using Particle-in-Cell
(PIC) hybrid simulations, with kinetic ions and fluid electrons, and analyze
the saturation mechanism for realistic CR and background plasma parameters. In
the linear regime, the observed growth rates and wavelengths match the
theoretical predictions; the nonlinear stage of the instability shows a strong
reaction of both the background plasma and the CR particles, with the
saturation level of the magnetic field varying with the CR parameters. The
simulations with CR-to-background density ratios of n_CR/n_b=10^(-5) reveal the
highest magnetic field saturation levels, with energy also being transferred to
the background plasma and to the perpendicular velocity components of the CR

Traditionally, DAVs that have been analyzed asteroseismologically have had
fewer than half a dozen modes. Such a large number of modes presents a special
challenge to white dwarf asteroseismology, but at the same time has the
potential to yield a detailed picture of the interior chemical make-up of
DAVs.We explore this possibility by varying the core profiles as well as the
layer masses.We use an iterative grid search approach to find best fit models
for G38-29 and R808 and comment on some of the intricacies of fine grid
searches in white dwarf asteroseismology.

model of crystal melting. This paper is divided into two parts, which are
closely related to each other. In the first part, we discuss the statistical
mechanical model of crystal melting counting BPS states. Each of the BPS state
contributing to the BPS index is in one-to-one correspondence with a
configuration of a molten crystal, and the statistical partition function of
the melting crystal gives the BPS partition function. We also show that smooth
geometry of the Calabi-Yau manifold emerges in the thermodynamic limit of the
crystal. This suggests a remarkable interpretation that an atom in the crystal
is a discretization of the classical geometry, giving an important clue as to
the geometry at the Planck scale.In the second part we discuss the wall
crossing phenomena. Wall crossing phenomena states that the BPS index depends
on the value of the moduli of the Calabi-Yau manifold, and jumps along real
codimension one subspaces in the moduli space. We show that by using type
IIA/M-theory duality, we can provide a simple and an intuitive derivation of
the wall crossing phenomena, furthermore clarifying the connection with the
topological string theory. This derivation is consistent with another
derivation from the wall crossing formula, motivated by multi-centered BPS
extremal black holes. We also explain the representation of the wall crossing
phenomena in terms of crystal melting, and the generalization of the counting
problem and the wall crossing to the open BPS invariants.

non-Gaussianity of local type. Phrasing f_NL inference in a Bayesian framework
takes advantage of existing techniques to account for instrumental effects and
foreground contamination in CMB data and takes into account uncertainties in
the cosmological parameters in an unambiguous way.
  Methods: We derive closed form expressions for the joint posterior of f_NL
and the reconstructed underlying curvature perturbation, Phi, and deduce the
conditional probability densities for f_NL and Phi. Completing the inference
problem amounts to finding the marginal density for f_NL. For realistic data
sets the necessary integrations are intractable. We propose an exact
Hamiltonian sampling algorithm to generate correlated samples from the f_NL
posterior. For sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios, we can exploit the
assumption of weak non-Gaussianity to find a direct Monte Carlo technique to
generate independent samples from the posterior distribution for f_NL. We
illustrate our approach using a simplified toy model of CMB data for the simple
case of a 1-D sky.
  Results: When applied to our toy problem, we find that, in the limit of high
signal-to-noise, the sampling efficiency of the approximate algorithm
outperforms that of Hamiltonian sampling by two orders of magnitude. When f_NL
is not significantly constrained by the data, the more efficient, approximate
algorithm biases the posterior density towards f_NL = 0.

the initial hypercube is gradually partitioned on to a set of smaller adjacent
hypercubes, while those hypercubes that cannot contain any point belonging to
the set of SPE are simultaneously withdrawn.
  Whether a given hypercube can contain an equilibrium point is verified by an
appropriate mathematical program. Three different formulations of the algorithm
for both approximately computing the set of SPE payoffs and extracting players'
strategies are then proposed: the first two that do not assume the presence of
an external coordination between players, and the third one that assumes a
certain level of coordination during game play for convexifying the set of
continuation payoffs after any repeated game history.
  A special attention is paid to the question of extracting players' strategies

the breaking of a nearly conformal strong dynamics, and compare the
phenomenology of the dilaton to that of the well motivated light composite
Higgs scenario. We argue that -- in addition to departures in the
decay/production rates into massless gauge bosons mediated by the conformal
anomaly -- characterizing features of the light dilaton scenario (as well as
other scenarios admitting a light CP-even scalar not directly related to the
breaking of the electro-weak symmetry) are off-shell events at high invariant
mass involving two longitudinally polarized vector bosons and a dilaton, and
tree-level flavor violating processes. Accommodating both electro-weak
precision measurements and flavor constraints appears especially challenging in
the ambiguous scenario in which the Higgs and the dilaton fields strongly mix.
We show that warped higgsless models of electro-weak symmetry breaking are
explicit and tractable realizations of this limiting case.

radial bins by comparing our observed color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) with
synthetic CMDs based on theoretical isochrones. We find that the stellar disk
out to 5.4 kpc is primarily old, in contrast with the outwardly similar galaxy
M33. We determine the scale length as a function of age and find evidence for
inside-out growth of the stellar disk: the scale length has increased from 1.1
+/- 0.1 kpc 10 Gyr ago to 1.3 +/- 0.1 kpc at present, indicating a buildup in
the fraction of young stars at larger radii. As the scale length of M33 has
recently been shown to have increased much more dramatically with time, our
results demonstrate that two galaxies with similar sizes and morphologies can
have very different histories. With an N-body simulation of a galaxy designed
to be similar to NGC 300, we determine that the effects of radial migration
should be minimal. We trace the metallicity gradient as a function of time and
find a present day metallicity gradient consistent with that seen in previous
studies. Consistent results are obtained from archival images covering the same

the study of complex networks. Current sampling methods such as (independent)
random vertex and random walks are useful but have drawbacks. Random vertex
sampling may require too many resources (time, bandwidth, or money). Random
walks, which normally require fewer resources per sample, can suffer from large
estimation errors in the presence of disconnected or loosely connected graphs.
In this work we propose a new $m$-dimensional random walk that uses $m$
dependent random walkers. We show that the proposed sampling method, which we
call Frontier sampling, exhibits all of the nice sampling properties of a
regular random walk. At the same time, our simulations over large real world
graphs show that, in the presence of disconnected or loosely connected
components, Frontier sampling exhibits lower estimation errors than regular

discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy. We test a very simple picture
which produces this Type 2 fraction with minimal assumptions. In this picture,
infall from large scales occurs in random directions, but must eventually align
with the inner accretion flow, producing a severely warped disk on parsec
scales. If the re-alignment is dominated by tilt, with minimal twist, a wide
range of covering factors is predicted in individual objects, but with an
expected mean fraction of Type 2 AGN of exactly 50%. This 'tilted disc' picture

Balmer lines in pure emission. The lines originate from a region of nearly
uniform field strength (delta B/B is approximately 0.1) that covers 10 per cent
of the stellar surface in which there is a temperature inversion. The energy
source that heats the photosphere remains a mystery but it is likely to be
associated with the presence of a companion. Based on current models we use
archival Spitzer IRAC observations to place a new and stringent upper limit of
12 Jupiter masses for the mass of such a companion. In the light of this result
and the recent discovery of a 115 min photometric period for GD 356, we exclude
previous models that invoke accretion and revisit the unipolar inductor model
that has been proposed for this system. In this model a highly conducting
planet with a metallic core orbits the magnetic white dwarf and, as it cuts
through field lines, a current is set flowing between the two bodies. This
current dissipates in the photosphere of the white dwarf and causes a
temperature inversion. Such a planet is unlikely to have survived the RGB/AGB
phases of evolution so we argue that it may have formed from the circumstellar
disc of a disrupted He or CO core during a rare merger of two white dwarfs. GD
356 would then be a white dwarf counterpart of the millisecond binary pulsar
PSR 1257+12 which is known to host a planetary system.

the divergences can be eliminated by methods such as zeta-function
regularization or through physical arguments (ultraviolet transparency of the
boundary would provide a cutoff). Using the example of a massless scalar field
theory with a single Dirichlet boundary we explore the relationship between
such approaches, with the goal of better understanding the origin of the
divergences. We are guided by the insight due to Dowker and Kennedy (1978) and
Deutsch and Candelas (1979), that the divergences represent measurable effects
that can be interpreted with the aid of the theory of the asymptotic
distribution of eigenvalues of the Laplacian discussed by Weyl. In many cases
the Casimir self-energy is the sum of cutoff-dependent (Weyl) terms having
geometrical origin, and an ""intrinsic"" term that is independent of the cutoff.
The Weyl terms make a measurable contribution to the physical situation even
when regularization methods succeed in isolating the intrinsic part.
Regularization methods fail when the Weyl terms and intrinsic parts of the
Casimir effect cannot be clearly separated. Specifically, we demonstrate that
the Casimir self-energy of a smooth boundary in two dimensions is a sum of two
Weyl terms (exhibiting quadratic and logarithmic cutoff dependence), a
geometrical term that is independent of cutoff, and a non-geometrical intrinsic
term. As by-products we resolve the puzzle of the divergent Casimir force on a
ring and correct the sign of the coefficient of linear tension of the Dirichlet
line predicted in earlier treatments.

innermost 0.16 pc of the Galaxy as measured by the number density profile of
late-type giants. Using laser guide star adaptive optics in conjunction with
the integral field spectrograph, OSIRIS, at the Keck II telescope, we are able
to differentiate between the older, late-type (~ 1 Gyr) stars, which are
presumed to be dynamically relaxed, and the unrelaxed young (~ 6 Myr)
population. This distinction is crucial for testing models of stellar cusp
formation in the vicinity of a black hole, as the models assume that the cusp
stars are in dynamical equilibrium in the black hole potential. We find that
contamination from young stars is significant, with more than twice as many
young stars as old stars in our sensitivity range (K < 15.5) within the central
arcsecond. Based on the late-type stars alone, the surface stellar number
density profile, is flat, with a projected power law slope of -0.26+-0.24.
These results are consistent with the nuclear star cluster having no cusp, with
a core profile that is significantly flatter than predicted by most cusp
formation theories. Here, we also review the methods for further constraining
the true three-dimensional radial profile using kinematic measurements. Precise
acceleration measurements in the plane of the sky as well as along the line of
sight has the potential to directly measure the density profile to establish
whether there is a ""hole"" in the distribution of late-type stars in the inner

modulation of both the Faraday depth and the polarized intensity and their
variation with galaxy inclination. A self-consistent and fully general model
for both the locations of net polarized emissivity at 1-2 GHz frequencies and
the global magnetic field topology of nearby galaxies emerges. Net polarized
emissivity is concentrated into two zones located above and below the galaxy
mid-plane, with the back-side zone suffering substantial depolarization (by a
factor of 4-5) relative to the front-side zone in its propagation through the
turbulent mid-plane. The field topology, which characterizes the thick-disk
emission zone is in all cases an axisymmetric spiral with a quadrupole
dependence on height above the mid-plane. The front-side emission is affected
by only mild dispersion (10's of rad/m2) from the thermal plasma in the galaxy
halo, while the back-side emission is affected by additional strong dispersion
(100's of rad/m2) from an axisymmetric spiral field in the galaxy mid-plane.
The field topology in the upper halo of galaxies is a mix of two distinct
types: a simple extension of the axisymmetric spiral quadrupole field of the
thick disk and a radially directed dipole field. The dipole component might be
a manifestation of (1) a circumnuclear, bipolar outflow, (2) an in situ
generated dipole field, or (3) evidence of a non-stationary global halo.

Hard X-ray Detector (HXD-PIN: 10 - 60 keV), Suzaku can determine the
temperature of hot galaxy clusters. We performed the spectral analysis, by
considering the temperature structure and the collimator response of the PIN
correctly. As a result, we found that the upper limit of the temperature in the
outer region is $\sim$ 14 keV, and an extremely hot gas, which was reported for
RXJ 1347.5-1145 and A 3667, was not found in the Perseus cluster. This
indicates that the Perseus cluster has not recently experienced a major merger.

of a real-time system as a collection of lower level parallel components that
preserve the timing and functional requirements of the upper level
specification. These mechanisms are discussed in the context of ASTRAL, which
is a formal specification language for real-time systems. Refinement is
accomplished by mapping all of the elements of an upper level specification
into lower level elements that may be split among several parallel components.
In addition, actions that can occur in the upper level are mapped to actions of
components operating at the lower level. This allows several types of
implementation strategies to be specified in a natural way, while the price for
generality (in terms of complexity) is paid only when necessary. The refinement
mechanisms are first illustrated using a simple digital circuit; then, through
a highly complex phone system; finally, design guidelines gleaned from these
specifications are presented.

buoyant to highly inertial; and their sizes were of the Kolmogorov scale. For
all particles, we observed a Batchelor like regime, in which particles
separated ballistically. Similar to the Batchelor regime for tracers, this
regime was observed in the early stages of the relative separation for times $t
\lessapprox 0.1 t_0$ with $t_0$ determined by the turbulence energy dissipation
rate and the initial separation between particle pairs. In this time interval
heavier particles separated faster than fluid tracers. The second order
Eulerian velocity structure functions was found to increase with density. In
other words, both observations show that the relative velocity between inertial
particles was larger than that between tracers. Based on the widely used,
simplified equation of motion for inertial point-particles, we derived a model
that shows an increase in relative velocity between inertial particles. In its
scale dependence, however, it disagrees quantitatively with the experimental

inertial particles, which is not captured by the model.

to occur in a series of very small--scale, chaotic events, whose gas flows have
no correlation with the large--scale structure of the galaxy or with each
other. The accreting gas has extremely low specific angular momentum and
probably represents only a small fraction of the gas involved in a galaxy
merger, which may be the underlying driver.
  Eddington accretion episodes in AGN must be common in order for the
supermassive black holes to grow. I show that they produce winds with
velocities $v \sim 0.1c$ and ionization parameters implying the presence of
resonance lines of helium-- and hydrogenlike iron. The wind creates a strong
cooling shock as it interacts with the interstellar medium of the host galaxy,
and this cooling region may be observable in an inverse Compton continuum and
lower--excitation emission lines associated with lower velocities. The shell of
matter swept up by the shocked wind stalls unless the black hole mass has
reached the value $M_{\sigma}$ implied by the $M - \sigma$ relation. Once this
mass is reached, further black hole growth is prevented. If the shocked gas did
not cool as asserted above, the resulting (`energy-driven') outflow would imply
a far smaller SMBH mass than actually observed. Minor accretion events with
small gas fractions can produce galaxy-wide outflows, including fossil outflows
in galaxies where there is little current AGN activity.

Victor Hess and the Italian Domenico Pacini, developed two brilliant lines of
research independently, leading to the determination of the origin of
atmospheric radiation. Before their work, the origin of the radiation today
called ""cosmic rays"" was strongly debated, as many scientists thought that
these particles came from the crust of the Earth.
  The approach by Hess is well known: Hess measured the rate of discharge of an
electroscope that flew aboard an atmospheric balloon. Because the discharge
rate increased as the balloon flew at higher altitude, he concluded in 1912
that the origin could not be terrestrial. For this discovery, Hess was awarded
the Nobel Prize in 1936, and his experiment became legendary.
  Shortly before, in 1911, Pacini, a professor at the University of Bari, made
a series of measurements to determine the variation in the speed of discharge
of an electroscope (and thus the intensity of the radiation) while the
electroscope was immersed in a box in a sea near the Naval Academy in the Bay
of Livorno (the Italian Navy supported the research). The measures are
documented in his work ""Penetrating radiation at the surface of and in water"".
Pacini discovered that the discharge of the oscilloscope was significantly
slower than at the surface.
  Documents testify that Pacini and Hess knew of each other's work. Pacini died
in 1934, two years before the Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of
cosmic rays. While Hess is remembered as the discoverer of cosmic rays, the
simultaneous discovery by Pacini is forgotten by most.

asymmetries detected in local curvature statistics of the 1 year WMAP data. In
Hansen et al 2004, it was found that the northern ecliptic hemisphere was
non-Gaussian at the ~1% level testing the densities of hill-, lake and saddle
points based on the second derivatives of the CMB temperature map. The 5 year
WMAP data has a much lower noise level and better control of systematics. Using
these, we find that the anomalies are still present at a consistent level. Also
the direction of maximum non-Gaussianity remains. Due to limited availability
of computer resources, Hansen et al. 2004 were unable to calculate the full
covariance matrix for the chi^2 test used. Here we apply the full covariance
matrix instead of the diagonal approximation and find that the
non-Gaussianities disappear and there is no preferred non-Gaussian direction.
We compare with simulations of weak lensing to see if this may cause the
observed non-Gaussianity when using diagonal covariance matrix. We conclude
that weak lensing does not produce non-Gaussianity in the local curvature
statistics at the scales investigated in this paper. The cause of the
non-Gaussian detection in the case of a diagonal matrix remains unclear.

methods to solve stochastic optimal control problems: scenario trees and
particles. The problem consists in finding strategies to control a dynamical
system perturbed by exogenous noises so as to minimize some expected cost along
a discrete and finite time horizon. We introduce the Mean Squared Error (MSE)
which is the expected $L^2$-distance between the strategy given by the
algorithm and the optimal strategy, as a performance indicator for the two
models. We study the behaviour of the MSE with respect to the number of
scenarios used for discretization. The first model, widely studied in the
Stochastic Programming community, consists in approximating the noise diffusion
using a scenario tree representation. On a numerical example, we observe that
the number of scenarios needed to obtain a given precision grows exponentially
with the time horizon. In that sense, our conclusion on scenario trees is
equivalent to the one in the work by Shapiro (2006) and has been widely noticed
by practitioners. However, in the second part, we show using the same example
that, by mixing Stochastic Programming and Dynamic Programming ideas, the
particle method described by Carpentier et al (2009) copes with this numerical
difficulty: the number of scenarios needed to obtain a given precision now does
not depend on the time horizon. Unfortunately, we also observe that serious
obstacles still arise from the system state space dimension.

process where a pair of electron-like quasi-particles and a pair of hole-like
quasi-particles arrive from the normal electrodes and annihilate in the

tunnel contacts, dSab/dV is positive because of CAR. In between these two
extremities, at intermediate transparencies, dSab/dV is negative because both

Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence at low Magnetic Reynolds number. The originality
of our approach is that instead of using traditional bases of functions, it
relies on the basis of eigenmodes of the dissipation operator, which represents
viscous and Joule dissipation. We apply this idea to the simple case of a
periodic domain in the three directions of space, with an homogeneous magnetic
field in the $\mathbf e_z$ direction. The basis is then still as subset of the
Fourier space, but ordered by growing linear decay rate $|\lambda|$ (\emph{i.e}
according to the \emph{least dissipative modes}). We show that because the
lines of constant energy tend to follow those of constant $|\lambda|$ in the
Fourier space, the scaling for the the smallest scales $|\lambda^{\rm max}|$ in
a forced flow can be expressed using this single parameter, as a function of
the Reynolds number as $\sqrt{|\lambda^{\rm max}|}/(2\pi k_f)\simeq
0.5\Rey^{1/2}$, where $k_f$ is the forcing wavelength, or as a function of the
Grashof number $\Gr_f$, which gives a non-dimensional measure of the forcing,
as $|\lambda^{\rm max}|^{1/2}/(2\pi k_f)\simeq 0.47\Gr_f^{0.20}$. This scaling
is also found consistent with heuristic scalings, and which we are able to
numerically quantify as $k_\perp^{\rm max}/k_f\simeq 0.5 \Rey^{1/2}$ and
$k_z^{\rm max}/k_f\simeq 0.8k_f \Rey/Ha$. Finally, we show that the set of
least dissipative modes gives a relevant prediction for the scale of the first
three-dimensional structure to appear in a forced, initially two-dimensional
turbulent flow. This completes our numerical demonstration that the least
dissipative modes can be used to simulate both two- and three-dimensional
low-Rm MHD flows.

Due to the
wide WLAN deployment, WLAN localization provides ubiquitous coverage and adds
to the value of the wireless network by providing the location of its users

usually require constructing a radio map, which is a major barrier of WLAN
localization systems' deployment. The radio map stores information about the
signal strength from different signal strength streams at selected locations in
the site of interest. Typical construction of a radio map involves measurements
and calibrations making it a tedious and time-consuming operation. In this
paper, we present the AROMA system that automatically constructs accurate
active and passive radio maps for both device-based and device-free WLAN
localization systems. AROMA has three main goals: high accuracy, low
computational requirements, and minimum user overhead. To achieve high
accuracy, AROMA uses 3D ray tracing enhanced with the uniform theory of
diffraction (UTD) to model the electric field behavior and the human shadowing
effect. AROMA also automates a number of routine tasks, such as importing
building models and automatic sampling of the area of interest, to reduce the
user's overhead. Finally, AROMA uses a number of optimization techniques to
reduce the computational requirements. We present our system architecture and
describe the details of its different components that allow AROMA to achieve
its goals. We evaluate AROMA in two different testbeds. Our experiments show
that the predicted signal strength differs from the measurements by a maximum

up to $\sim$5 Mpc, contain information on the history of AGN activity in the

recurrent AGN activity. The most striking examples of recurrent activity in
radio galaxies and quasars are the double-double or triple-double radio sources

an older population. We review briefly the radio continuum as well as molecular

determine which runaway scenario - a supernova explosion disrupting a binary
system or dynamical interaction in star clusters - may be responsible for HIP
60350's peculiar orbit. Based on a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium
approach, a high-resolution optical echelle spectrum was examined to revise
spectroscopic quantities and for the first time to perform a differential
chemical abundance analysis with respect to the B-type star 18 Peg. The results
together with proper motions from the Hipparcos Catalog further allowed the
three-dimensional kinematics of the star to be studied numerically. The
abundances derived for HIP 60350 are consistent with a slightly supersolar
metallicity agreeing with the kinematically predicted place of birth ca. 6 kpc
away from the Galactic center. However, they do not exclude the possibility of
an alpha-enhanced abundance pattern expected in the case of the supernova
scenario. Its outstanding high Galactic rest frame velocity of 530 plus-minus
35 km/s is a consequence of ejection in the direction of Galactic rotation and
slightly exceeds the local Galactic escape velocity in a standard Galactic
potential. Hence HIP 60350 may be unbound to the Galaxy.

Furthermore, we aimed for atmospheric models which are able to quantitatively
reproduce line profile variations found in observed spectra of pulsating
late-type giants. Models describing pulsation-enhanced dust-driven winds were
used to compute synthetic spectra under the assumptions of chemical equilibrium
and LTE and by solving the radiative transfer in spherical geometry including
velocity effects. Radial velocities derived from Doppler-shifted synthetic line
profiles provide information on the gas velocities in the line-forming region
of the spectral features. On the basis of dynamic models we investigated in
detail the finding that various molecular features in AGB spectra originate at
different geometrical depths of the very extended atmospheres. We show that the
models are able to quantitatively reproduce the characteristic line profile
variations of lines sampling the deep photosphere. The global velocity fields
of typical LPVs are also realistically reproduced. Possible reasons for
discrepancies concerning other modelling results are outlined. In addition, we
present a model showing variations of CO dv=3 line profiles comparable to
observed spectra of SRVs and discuss that the non-occurence of line doubling in
these objects may be due to a density effect. The results of our line profile
modelling are another indication that the dynamic models studied here are
approaching a realistic representation of the outer layers of AGB stars.

manifests itself through the light time effect influencing the observed times
of eclipses as the close binary and the circumbinary companion both move around
the common centre of mass. This fact combined with the periodicity with which
the eclipses occur can be used to detect the companion. Given a sufficient
precision of the times of eclipses, the eclipse timing can be employed to
detect substellar or even planetary mass companions.
  The main goal of the paper is to investigate the potential of the photometry
based eclipse timing of binary stars as a method of detecting circumbinary
planets. In the models we assume that the companion orbits a binary star in a
circular Keplerian orbit. We analyze both the space and ground based photometry
cases. In particular, we study the usefulness of the on-going COROT and Kepler
missions in detecting circumbinary planets. We also explore the relations
binding the planet discovery space with the physical parameters of the binaries
and the geometrical parameters of their light curves. We carry out detailed
numerical simulations of the eclipse timing by employing a relatively realistic
model of the light curves of eclipsing binary stars. We study the influence of
the white and red photometric noises on the timing precision. We determine the
sensitivity of the eclipse timing technique to circumbinary planets for the
ground and space based photometric observations. We provide suggestions for the
best targets, observing strategies and instruments for the eclipse timing

intersection they have (if any) with the satellite trajectory. The situational
condition is herein transformed into the plane of Kepler's orbit, thereafter it
is reduced to a second-order plane curve- quadric (ellipse or parabola). The
solution of this system, containing the equation of this curve and Kepler's

detailed high resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the Reflection Grating
Spectrometer. The observations can be used to follow the detailed evolution of
the arising supernova remnant. The fluxes and broadening of the numerous
emission lines seen in the dispersed spectra provide information on the
evolution of the X-ray emitting plasma and its dynamics. These were analyzed in
combination with the EPIC-pn spectra, which allow a precise determination of
the higher temperature plasma. We modeled individual emission lines and fitted
plasma emission models. Especially from the observations between 2003 and 2007
we can see a significant evolution of the plasma parameters and a deceleration
of the radial velocity of the lower temperature plasma regions. We found an
indication (3-sigma-level) of an iron K feature in the co-added EPIC-pn
spectra. The comparison with Chandra grating observations in 2004 yields a
clear temporal coherence of the spectral evolution and the sudden deceleration
of the expansion velocity seen in X-ray images ~6100 days after the explosion.

stars can severely erode the atmospheres of orbiting planets. No observational
tests of the long term effects of erosion have yet been made. Aims: To analyze
the current distribution of planetary mass with X-ray irradiation of the
atmospheres in order to make an observational assessment of the effects of
erosion by coronal radiation. Methods: We study a large sample of
planet-hosting stars with XMM-Newton, Chandra and ROSAT; make a careful
identification of X-ray counterparts; and fit their spectra to make accurately
measurements of the stellar X-ray flux. Results: The distribution of the
planetary masses with X-ray flux suggests that erosion has taken place: most
surviving massive planets, (M_p sin i >1.5 M_J), have been exposed to lower
accumulated irradiation. Heavy erosion during the initial stages of stellar
evolution is followed by a phase of much weaker erosion. A line dividing these
two phases could be present, showing a strong dependence on planet mass.
Although a larger sample will be required to establish a well-defined erosion
line, the distribution found is very suggestive. Conclusions: The distribution
of planetary mass with X-ray flux is consistent with a scenario in which planet
atmospheres have suffered the effects of erosion by coronal X-ray and EUV
emission. The erosion line is an observational constraint to models of
atmospheric erosion.

first Chapter we show how gravitational waves are derived from Einstein's
General theory of Relativity and discuss the emission of gravitational waves
from inspiraling binaries and how this radiation may be detected using laser
interferometers. Around two thirds of stars inhabit binary systems. As they
orbit each other they will emit both energy and angular momentum in the form of
gravitational waves which will inevitably lead to their inspiral and eventual
merger. To date, searches for gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral
of binary systems have concentrated on systems with non-spinning components. In
Chapter 2 we detail the first dedicated search for binaries consisting of
spinning stellar mass compact objects. We analysed 788 hours of data collected
during the third science run (S3) of the LIGO detectors, no detection of
gravitational waves was made and we set an upper limit on the rate of
coalescences of stellar mass binaries. The inspiral of stellar mass compact
objects into super massive black holes will radiate gravitational waves at
frequencies detectable by the planned space-based LISA mission. In Chapter 3 we
describe the development and testing of a computationally cheap method to
detect the loudest few extreme mass ratio inspiral events that LISA will be
sensitive to.

combination of CMB anisotropy data and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. Our
analysis constrains $\alpha_{\mathrm{S},0} = -0.051^{+0.047}_{-0.053}$
$(-0.034^{+0.039}_{-0.040})$ at 95% Confidence Level when (not) taking into
account primordial gravitational waves in a ratio as predicted by canonical
single field inflation, in agreement with other works. For the cosmological
models best fitting the data both with and without running we studied the
abundance of galaxy clusters and of rare objects, the halo bias, the
concentration of dark matter halos, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation, the power
spectrum of cosmic shear, and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We find that
counting galaxy clusters in future X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich surveys could
discriminate between the two models, more so if broad redshift information
about the cluster samples will be available. Likewise, measurements of the
power spectrum of cosmological weak lensing as performed by planned all-sky
optical surveys such as EUCLID could detect a running of the primordial
spectral index, provided the uncertainties about the source redshift
distribution and the underlying matter power spectrum are well under control.

the statistics is given by the Tracy-Widom distribution, known already from the
theory of GUE random matrices. Our solution confirms that the KPZ equation
describes the interface motion in the regime of weak driving force. Within this

model takes into account the $J/\psi$ suppression from the quark-gluon plasma
and hadron gas as well as the nuclear absorption of primordial charmonia and
the regeneration effects at the hadronization stage, and hence is a
generalization of the two component model introduced by Grandchamp and Rapp.
The improvements in this work are twofold; the addition of the initial local
temperature profile and a consistent use of QCD NLO formula for both the
dissociation cross section in the hadron gas and the thermal decay widths in
the quark-gluon plasma for the charmonium states. The initial local temperature
profile is determined from the assumption that the local entropy density is
proportional to a formula involving the number densities of the number of
participants and of the binary collisions that reproduces the multiplicities of
charged particles at chemical freeze-out. The initial local temperature profile
brings about a kink in the $R_{AA}$ curve due to the initial melting of
$J/\psi$. The initially formed fireball, composed of weakly interacting quarks
and gluons with thermal masses that are extracted from lattice QCD, follows an
isentropic expansion with cylindrical symmetry. The fit reproduces well the
Au+Au as well as the Cu+Cu data. The same method is applied to predict the
$R_{AA}$ expected from the Pb+Pb collision at LHC energy.

of a progressive evolution of the local viscosity towards two significantly
different values in two adjoining regions of the fluids in which the stress
takes slightly different values. This suggests that from a global point of view
shear-banding in these systems has a common physical origin: two physical
phenomena (for example, in colloids, destructuration due to flow and
restructuration due to aging) are in competition and, depending on the flow
conditions, one of them becomes dominant and makes the system evolve in a
specific direction.

changes groups or interact on its opinion with one of its internal or external
neighbour. If it decides to look at the group level, it changes groups if its
opinion is far from the average of its group from more than a threshold. If it
is the case, it joins the group which has proportionally the closest average
opinion from its. If it decides to interact with one of its neighbour, it
becomes closer in opinion to it when its opinion and the one of the
selected-to-interact neighbour are less distant from the threshold. From the
study of this coupled model, we discover some surprising behaviours compared to
the known behaviour of the Deffuant bounded confidence model(BC): The coupled
model exhibits a total consensus for an threshold value lower than the BC
model; the distribution of sizes of the groups changes: some groups become
larger while other decrease in size, sometimes until containing only one
individual; from the point of view of the groups, the consensus remains for a
large set of threshold values while, looking at the population level, there are
a lot of opinion clusters.
