electron-phonon (el-ph) coupling in doped insulators using angle resolved
photoemission (ARPES), yielding evidence for the dominant role of el-ph
interactions in underdoped cuprates. As these studies have been limited to
doped Mott insulators, the important question arises how this compares with
doped band insulators where similar el-ph couplings should be at work. The
archetypical case is the perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO), well known for its giant
dielectric constant of 10000 at low temperature, exceeding that of
La$_2$CuO$_4$ by a factor of 500. Based on this fact, it has been suggested
that doped STO should be the archetypical bipolaron superconductor. Here we
report an ARPES study from high-quality surfaces of lightly doped SrTiO$_3$.
Comparing to lightly doped Mott insulators, we find the signatures of only
moderate electron-phonon coupling: a dispersion anomaly associated with the low
frequency optical phonon with a $\lambda'\sim0.3$ and an overall bandwidth
renormalization suggesting an overall $\lambda'\sim0.7$ coming from the higher
frequency phonons. Further, we find no clear signatures of the large pseudogap
or small polaron phenomena. These findings demonstrate that a large dielectric
constant itself is not a good indicator of el-ph coupling and highlight the
unusually strong effects of the el-ph coupling in doped Mott insulators.

metal-ligand distance. The coupling is a result of the spin-orbit interaction
causing a change in the local moment. Recurrence to the initial state is
prevented by the damping of the phonon oscillation. The decay time is faster
than the oscillation frequency of the transition metal-ligand stretch mode, in
agreement with experiment. For energies above the region where the strongest
coupling occurs, a slower ""leakage-type"" decay is observed. If the photoexcited
state is lower in energy than the state it couples to, then there is no decay.

shells of width 0.1 and measure w in each subsample in order to investigate the
evolution of SDSS galaxies. We find that the bias increases substantially with
redshift - much more so than one would expect for a passively evolving sample.
We use halo-model analysis to determine the best-fit
halo-occupation-distribution (HOD) for each subsample, and the best-fit models
allow us to interpret the change in bias physically. In order to properly
interpret our best-fit HODs, we convert each halo mass to its z = 0 passively
evolved bias (bo), enabling a direct comparison of the best-fit HODs at
different redshifts. We find that the minimum halo bo required to host a galaxy
decreases as the redshift decreases, suggesting that galaxies with Mr < -21.2
are forming in halos at the low-mass end of the HODs over our redshift range.
We use the best-fit HODs to determine the change in occupation number divided
by the change in mass of halos with constant bo and we find a sharp peak at bo
~ 0.9 - corresponding to an average halo mass of ~ 10^12Msol/h. We thus present
the following scenario: the bias of galaxies with Mr < -21.2 decreases as the
Universe evolves because these galaxies form in halos of mass ~ 10^12Msol/h
(independent of redshift), and the bias of these halos naturally decreases as
the Universe evolves.

laboratory-irradiated CCDs. Only charge traps with time constants of the same
order as the time between row transfers during readout affect galaxy shape
measurements. We characterize the effects of CTI on various galaxy populations.
We baseline our study around p-channel CCDs that have been shown to have charge
transfer efficiency up to an order of magnitude better than several models of
n-channel CCDs designed for space applications. We predict that for galaxies
furthest from the readout registers, bias in the measurement of galaxy shapes,
Delta(e), will increase at a rate of 2.65 +/- 0.02 x 10^(-4) per year at L2 for
accumulated radiation exposure averaged over the solar cycle. If uncorrected,
this will consume the entire shape measurement error budget of a dark energy
mission within about 4 years. Software mitigation techniques demonstrated
elsewhere can reduce this by a factor of ~10, bringing the effect well below
mission requirements. CCDs with higher CTI than the ones we studeied may not
meet the requirements of future dark energy missions. We discuss ways in which
hardware could be designed to further minimize the impact of CTI.

  Processes","8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adaptive control problems are notoriously difficult to solve even in the
presence of plant-specific controllers. One way to by-pass the intractable
computation of the optimal policy is to restate the adaptive control as the
minimization of the relative entropy of a controller that ignores the true
plant dynamics from an informed controller. The solution is given by the
Bayesian control rule-a set of equations characterizing a stochastic adaptive
controller for the class of possible plant dynamics. Here, the Bayesian control
rule is applied to derive BCR-MDP, a controller to solve undiscounted Markov
decision processes with finite state and action spaces and unknown dynamics. In
particular, we derive a non-parametric conjugate prior distribution over the
policy space that encapsulates the agent's whole relevant history and we
present a Gibbs sampler to draw random policies from this distribution.
Preliminary results show that BCR-MDP successfully avoids sub-optimal limit
cycles due to its built-in mechanism to balance exploration versus
exploitation.

  The theory of the DDA and its implementation in DDSCAT is presented in Draine
(1988) and Draine & Flatau (1994), and its extension to periodic structures
(and near-field calculations) in Draine & Flatau (2008). DDSCAT 7.1 includes
support for MPI, OpenMP, and the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL). DDSCAT
supports calculations for a variety of target geometries. Target materials may
be both inhomogeneous and anisotropic. It is straightforward for the user to
""import"" arbitrary target geometries into the code. DDSCAT automatically
calculates total cross sections for absorption and scattering and selected
elements of the Mueller scattering intensity matrix.
  This User Guide explains how to use DDSCAT 7.1 to carry out electromagnetic
scattering calculations. DDfield, a Fortran-90 code to calculate E and B at
user-selected locations near the target, is included in the distribution. A
number of changes have been made since the last release, DDSCAT 7.0 .

that the superconducting gap is fully opened, and is strikingly different from
that observed in iron-pnictide analogs. In the normal state, 1/T_1T is constant
in the temperature range T_c \sim 4 K < T <10 K for all compounds and up to
T=250 K for x=0 and 0.06, which indicates weak electron correlations and is
also different from the iron analog. We argue that the differences between the
iron and nickel pnictides arise from the different electronic band structure.
Our results highlight the importance of the peculiar Fermi-surface topology in

play an important role in revealing how affinity maturation is achieved.
However, the existing models encountered some conflicts with experiments. To
resolve these conflicts, we present a coarse-grained model to calculate the B
cell population development in affinity maturation, which allows a
comprehensive analysis of its parameter space to look for optimal values of
mutation rate, selection strength, and initial antibody-antigen binding level
that maximize the affinity improvement. With these optimized parameters, the
model is compatible with the experimental observations such as the ~100-fold
affinity improvements, the number of mutations, the hypermutation rate, and the
""all or none"" phenomenon. Moreover, we study the reasons behind the optimal
parameters. The optimal mutation rate, in agreement with the hypermutation rate
in vivo, results from a tradeoff between accumulating enough beneficial
mutations and avoiding too many deleterious or lethal mutations. The optimal
selection strength evolves as a balance between the need for affinity
improvement and the requirement to pass the population bottleneck. These
findings point to the conclusion that germinal centers have been optimized by
evolution to generate strong affinity antibodies effectively and rapidly. In
addition, we study the enhancement of affinity improvement due to B cell
migration between germinal centers. These results could enhance our
understandings to the functions of germinal centers.

local explosive events, possibly supernova explosions. These suggest that the
energetic HVCCs are associated with massive compact clusters, which have been
formed by microbursts of star formation. Rough estimates of the energy flow
from large to small scale suggest that the supernova shocks can make a
significant contribution to turbulence activation and gas heating in the CMZ.

Here we show that this is not the case. We design fault-tolerant circuits for

within nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) where natural separation between

control over long periods of time to shape the experiment to almost ideal
adoption to the spin system and external manipulations. This has led to new
design principles as well as powerful new experimental methods within magnetic

some known results of this flavour with a new point of view. Roughly speaking,
we will endow the ball with some kind of Dirichlet distribution that
generalizes the uniform one and will follow the method developed in Skibinsky
(1967), Chang et al. (1993) in the context of the randomized moment space. The
main idea is to build a suitable coordinate change involving independent random

calculated polarization $(P_{s})$, volume, and integrated intensity of

spectroscopy, dielectric and ac conductivity measurements were performed in
temperature range $473K \leq T \leq 573K$ to probe the origin of large remnant
polarization and frequency dependent broad transitions with large dielectric
constant near $T_c^{FE}$. Results of impedance spectroscopy measurements
clearly show contributions of both grain and grain boundaries throughout the
frequency range ($10^{3}$ Hz$\leq f\leq 10^{7} $ Hz). It could be concluded
that the grain boundaries are more resistive and capacitive as compared to the
grains, resulting in inhomogeneities in the sample causing broad frequency
dependent dielectric anomalies. Enhancement in dielectric constant and remnant
polarization values are possibly due to space charge polarization caused by
piling of charges at the interface of grains and grain boundaries. The
imaginary parts of dielectric constant ($\epsilon^{\prime\prime}$) Vs frequency
data were fitted using Maxwell-Wagner model at $T_c^{FE}(\sim 523$K) and model
fits very well with the data up to $10^{5}$ Hz. Magnetodielectric measurements

with reflection seismic data from the SeaCause II cruise, the deep structure of

of sediments overlie the oceanic crust at the trench, and the subducting slab
can be imaged down to a depth of 35 km. We find a crystalline backstop 120 km

lower landward limit of the raycovered domain, at 22 km depth, marks a shallow
continental Moho, 170 km from the trench. The deep structure obtained from the

predict the limits of the seismogenic zone along the plate boundary fault.
Assuming 100C-150C as its updip limit, the seismogenic zone is predicted to

Maggiore, the quantum area spectra of black holes have been investigated
recently. Adopting the modified Hod's treatment, results show that the area
spectra for black holes are equally spaced and the spacings are in a unified
form, $\triangle A=8\pi \hbar$, in Einstein gravity. On the other hand,
following Kunstatter's method, the studies show that the area spectrum for a
nonrotating black hole with no charge is equidistant. And for a rotating (or
charged) black hole, it is also equidistant and independent of the angular
momentum $J$ (or charge $q$) when the black hole is far from the extremal case.
In this paper, we mainly deal with the area spectrum of the stringy charged
Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black hole, originating from effective action
that emerges in the low-energy string theory. We find that both methods give
the same results-that the area spectrum is equally spaced and does not depend
on the charge $q$. Our study may provide new insights into understanding the
area spectrum and entropy spectrum for stringy black holes.

properties in these quasar systems close to the end of the cosmic reionization.
Complementary results are also presented for low-J CO lines observed at the GBT

bolometer camera at the CSO. We then present a study of the molecular gas
properties in our combined sample of eight CO-detected quasars at z~6. The
detections of high-order CO line emission in these objects indicates the
presence of highly excited molecular gas, with estimated masses on the order of
10^10 M_sun within the quasar host galaxies. No significant difference is found
in the gas mass and CO line width distributions between our z~6 quasars and

Most of the CO-detected quasars at z~6 follow the far infrared-CO luminosity

significantly to the dust heating at FIR wavelengths. The result is consistent

source of GeV gamma-rays by the AGILE and the {\it Fermi} satellites. It shows
emission features in the GeV gamma-rays similar to other gamma-ray binaries
which were also observed in the TeV gamma-rays (LS 5039 and LSI +61 303). The
question appears whether Cyg X-3 can be also detected in the TeV gamma-rays by
the Cherenkov telescopes.
  Here we discuss this problem in detail based on the anisotropic inverse
Compton (IC) e-p pair cascade model successfully applied to TeV gamma-ray
binaries. We calculate the gamma-ray light curves and gamma-ray spectra
expected from the cascade process occurring inside the Cyg X-3 binary system.
It is found that the gamma-ray light curves at GeV energies can be consistent
with the gamma-ray light curve observed by the Fermi for reasonable parameters
of the orbit of the injection source of relativistic electrons. Moreover, we
show that in such a model the sub-TeV gamma-ray emission (above 100 GeV) is
expected to be below sensitivities of the present Cherenkov telescopes assuming
that electrons are accelerated in Cyg X-3 to TeV energies. The next stage
Cherenkov telescopes (MAGIC II, HESS II) should have the energy threshold in
the range 20-30 GeV, in order to have a chance to detect the signal from Cyg
X-3. Otherwise, the positive detection of gamma-rays at energies above a few
tens of GeV requires a telescope with the sensitivity of ~0.1% of Crab Units.
We conclude that detection of sub-TeV gamma-rays from Cyg X-3 by on-ground
telescopes has to probably wait for construction of the Cherenkov Telescope
Array (CTA).

are controlled by the synthesis of the hormone auxin, which is regulated by two
signals, an environmental one and an internal one. Considering that the auxin
signal induces plant growth after a time lag, this work shows that plant growth
can be modelled in terms of an energy-like function extremization, provided
that the Markov property is not applied. The simulated height distributions are
bimodal and right skewed, as in real community of plants. In the case of
isolated plants, the theoretical expressions for the growth dynamics and the
growth speed excellently fit experimental data for Arabidopsis thaliana.
Moreover, the growth dynamics of this model is shown to be consistent with the
biomass production function of an independent model. These results suggest that

chemistry in the mesosphere. The evidence in these research fields is here
analyzed and found to agree well with the properties of Rydberg Matter (RM).
This material has been studied with numerous methods in the laboratory. Alkali
atoms, mainly Na, reach the mesosphere in the form of interplanetary
(meteoritic, cometary) dust. The planar RM clusters NaN usually contain N = 19,
37 or 61 atoms, and have the density of air at 90 km altitude where they float.
The diameters of the clusters are 10-100 nm from laboratory high precision
radio frequency spectroscopic studies. Such experiments show that RM clusters
interact strongly with radar frequencies: this explains the radio frequency
heating and reflection studies of PMSE layers. The clusters give the low
temperature in the mesosphere by efficient selective radiation at long
wavelengths, which is observed in RF emission experiments. The lowest possible
stable temperature of the mesopause is calculated for the first time to be 121
K in agreement with measurements, based on the strong optical activity at long
wavelengths in RM. Sporadic sodium layers are explained in a unique way as due
to shockwaves in the RM layers. Due to the high electronic excitation energy in
RM clusters, they induce efficient reactions forming ions of all atoms and
molecules in the atmosphere thus providing condensation nuclei for water
vapour. This finally gives the visible part of the PMC structure. The present
contribution fills the gap between and partially replaces the separate theories

collisions at thermal energies is governed by diffraction of matter waves from
a two-dimensional repulsive core of the atom-molecule potential. Furthermore,
the model polarization moments characterizing the He-NO, He-O$_2$, He-OH, and
He-CaH stereodynamics are found to coalesce into a single, distinctive pattern,
which can serve as a ""fingerprint"" to identify diffraction-driven
stereodynamics in future work.

Amplitude equations with accelerated strain relaxation in the solid are shown
to model accurately the Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld instability. Polycrystalline
growth is also well described. However, the survey of grain boundary energies
shows that the approach is only valid for a restricted range of misorientations
as a direct consequence of an amplitude expansion. This range covers
approximately half the complete range allowed by crystal symmetry for some
fixed reference set of density waves used in the expansion. Over this range,
coupled motion to shear is well described by known geometrical rules and a
transition from coupling to sliding motion is also reproduced. Amplitude
equations for alloys are derived phenomenologically in a Ginzburg-Landau
spirit. Vegard's law is shown to be naturally described by seeking a gauge
invariant form of those equations under a transformation that corresponds to a
lattice expansion and deviations from Vegard's law can be easily incorporated.
Those equations realistically describe the dilute alloy limit and have the same
flexibility as conventional phase-field models for incorporating arbitrary

compute, for arbitrary twist angle, the leading O(a^2) corrections appearing at

a linear model $Y = X \beta + \epsilon$, where $X_{n \times p}$ is a design
matrix normalized to have column $\ell_2$ norm $\sqrt{n}$, and $\epsilon \sim

achieve with an {\em oracle} while selecting a sufficiently sparse model --
hence achieving {\it sparse oracle inequalities}; the oracle would supply
perfect information about which coordinates are non-zero and which are above
the noise level. In some sense, the Thresholded Lasso recovers the choices that
would have been made by the $\ell_0$ penalized least squares estimators, in
that it selects a sufficiently sparse model without sacrificing the accuracy in
estimating $\beta$ and in predicting $X \beta$. We also show for the
Gauss-Dantzig selector (Cand\`{e}s-Tao 07), if $X$ obeys a uniform uncertainty
principle and if the true parameter is sufficiently sparse, one will achieve
the sparse oracle inequalities as above, while allowing at most $s_0$

a series of straight runs, interrupted by tumbles which cause change of
direction. It performs chemotaxis towards chemo-attractants by extending the
duration of runs in the direction of the source. When there is a spatial
gradient in the attractant concentration, this bias produces a drift velocity
directed towards its source, whereas in a uniform concentration, E.coli adapts,
almost perfectly in case of methyl aspartate. Recently, microfluidic
experiments have measured the drift velocity of E.coli in precisely controlled
attractant gradients, but no general theoretical expression for the same
exists. With this motivation, we study an analytically soluble model here,
based on the Barkai-Leibler model, originally introduced to explain the perfect
adaptation. Rigorous mathematical expressions are obtained for the chemotactic
response function and the drift velocity in the limit of weak gradients and
under the assumption of completely random tumbles. The theoretical predictions
compare favorably with experimental results, especially at high concentrations.

astrometric accuracy of our catalog is 0.4 arcsec with respect to the 2MASS

probabilistic verifier. The verifier is only allowed to read a very small
portion of the proof, and in return is allowed to err with some bounded
probability. The probability that the verifier accepts a false proof is called
the soundness error, and is an important parameter of a PCP system that one
seeks to minimize. Constructing PCPs with sub-constant soundness error and, at
the same time, a minimal number of queries into the proof (namely two) is
especially important due to applications for inapproximability.
  In this work we construct such PCP verifiers, i.e., PCPs that make only two
queries and have sub-constant soundness error. Our construction can be viewed
as a combinatorial alternative to the ""manifold vs. point"" construction, which
is the only construction in the literature for this parameter range. The
""manifold vs. point"" PCP is based on a low degree test, while our construction
is based on a direct product test. We also extend our construction to yield a
decodable PCP (dPCP) with the same parameters. By plugging in this dPCP into
the scheme of Dinur and Harsha (FOCS 2009) one gets an alternative construction
of the result of Moshkovitz and Raz (FOCS 2008), namely: a construction of
two-query PCPs with small soundness error and small alphabet size.
  Our construction of a PCP is based on extending the derandomized direct
product test of Impagliazzo, Kabanets and Wigderson (STOC 09) to a derandomized
parallel repetition theorem. More accurately, our PCP construction is obtained
in two steps. We first prove a derandomized parallel repetition theorem for
specially structured PCPs. Then, we show that any PCP can be transformed into
one that has the required structure, by embedding it on a de-Bruijn graph.

variational solutions with the self-consistency conditions build in, with those
of the non-variational approach based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
self-consistent equations. Combination of the present variational approach with
the new renormalization scheme (taken from Fukushima's work) provides, for $t/J

disappearance of the d-wave superconductivity. Also, the hole concentration $x

results show the possibility of a direct connection between the dynamic
phenomena of the solar core and the atmospheric activity. Namely, an initial
heating about DQ_0 ~ 10^{31}-10^{37} ergs can be enough for a bubble to reach
the outer convective zone. Our calculations show that a hot bubble can arrive
into subphotospheric regions with DQ_final ~ 10^{28} - 10^{34} ergs with a high
speed, up to 10 km s-1, approaching the local sound speed. We point out that
the developing sonic boom transforms the shock front into accelerated particle
beam injected upwards into the top of loop carried out by the hot bubble above
its forefront traveling from the solar interior. As a result, a new perspective
arises to explain flare energetics. We show that the particle beams generated
by energetic deep-origin hot bubbles in the subphotospheric layers have masses,
energies, and chemical compositions in the observed range of solar
chromospheric and coronal flares. It is shown how the emergence of a hot bubble

electronics: producing organic field-effect transistors with trap densities as
low as in the bulk of single crystals. We studied the spectral density of
localized states in the band gap (trap DOS) of small molecule organic
semiconductors as derived from electrical characteristics of organic
field-effect transistors or from space-charge-limited-current measurements.
This was done by comparing data from a large number of samples including
thin-film transistors (TFT's), single crystal field-effect transistors
(SC-FET's) and bulk samples. The compilation of all data strongly suggests that
structural defects associated with grain boundaries are the main cause of
""fast"" hole traps in TFT's made with vacuum-evaporated pentacene. For
high-performance transistors made with small molecule semiconductors such as
rubrene it is essential to reduce the dipolar disorder caused by water adsorbed
on the gate dielectric surface. In samples with very low trap densities, we
sometimes observe a steep increase of the trap DOS very close (<0.15 eV) to the
mobility edge with a characteristic slope of 10-20 meV. It is discussed to what
degree band broadening due to the thermal fluctuation of the intermolecular
transfer integral is reflected in this steep increase of the trap DOS.
Moreover, we show that the trap DOS in TFT's with small molecule semiconductors
is very similar to the trap DOS in hydrogenated amorphous silicon even though
polycrystalline films of small molecules with van der Waals-type interaction on
the one hand are compared with covalently bound amorphous silicon on the other

infer the X-ray mass estimate deriving the density and temperature profiles of

approach; assuming that the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium and adopting
a matter density profile, we can recover the total mass distribution of Abell
611 via the X-ray data. We derive the total projected mass in the central
region of Abell 611 performing a parametric analysis of its strong lensing
features through the publicly available analysis software Lenstool. As a final
step we compare the results obtained with both methods. We derive a good
agreement between the X-ray and strong lensing total mass estimates in the
central region (i.e. within the radius r ~100 kpc), while a marginal
disagreement is found between the two mass estimates when extrapolating the
strong lensing results in the outer spatial range. We suggest that in this case
the X-ray/strong lensing mass disagreement can be explained by an incorrect
estimate of the relative contributions of the baryonic component and of the
dark matter, caused by the intrinsic degeneracy between the different mass
components in the strong lensing analysis. We discuss the effect of some
possible systematic errors that influence both mass estimates. We find a slight
dependence of the measurements of the X-ray temperatures (and therefore of the
X-ray total masses) on the background adopted in the spectral analysis, with
total deviations on the value of M_200 of the order of the 1-sigma statistical
error. The strong lensing mass results are instead sensitive to the
parameterisation of the galactic halo mass in the central regions, in
particular to the modelling of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) baryonic

varies over time. Both models feature transmitters randomly located in the
Euclidean plane, according to a Poisson point process with the receivers
randomly located at a fixed distance from the emitters. We concentrate on the
so-called outage scenario, where a successful transmission requires a
Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR) larger than a given threshold.
With Rayleigh fading and the SINR averaged over the duration of the packet
transmission, both models lead to closed form expressions for the probability
of successful transmission. We show an excellent matching of these results with
simulations. Using our models we compare the performances of non-slotted Aloha
to previously studied slotted Aloha. We observe that when the path loss is not
very strong both models, when appropriately optimized, exhibit similar
performance. For stronger path loss non-slotted Aloha performs worse than
slotted Aloha, however when the path loss exponent is equal to 4 its density of
successfully received packets is still 75% of that in the slotted scheme. This
is still much more than the 50% predicted by the well-known analysis where
simultaneous transmissions are never successful. Moreover, in any path loss
scenario, both schemes exhibit the same energy efficiency.
