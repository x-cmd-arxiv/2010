existence of a hidden dual superconformal symmetry. Together with the

the planar scattering amplitudes to all loops. We study the general form of the
invariants of both symmetries. We first construct an integral representation
for the most general dual superconformal invariants and show that it allows a
considerable freedom in the choice of the integration measure. We then perform
a half-Fourier transform to twistor space, where conventional conformal
symmetry is realized locally, derive the resulting conformal Ward identity for
the integration measure and show that it admits a unique solution. Thus, the
combination of dual and conventional superconformal symmetries, together with
invariance under helicity rescalings, completely fixes the form of the

superconformal invariants and coincide with the recently proposed coefficients
of the leading singularities of the scattering amplitudes as contour integrals

show that, on hypercubic lattices, such colored plaquette variables constitute
Yang-Baxter maps, where holonomy is characterized by certain dynamical
deformation of quantum Yang-Baxter equations. Consistent dimensional reduction
to Wilson's lattice gauge theory singles out unique compactness condition. We
study a class of theories where the compactness condition is solved by Lax pair
ansatz. We find that, in naive classical continuum limit, these theories
recover Lorentz invariance but have degrees of freedom that scales as N^2 at
large N. This implies that nontrivial quantum continuum limit must be sought
for. We demonstrate that, after dimensional reduction, these theories are
reduced to Wilson's lattice gauge theory. We also show that Wilson surfaces are
well-defined physical observables without ordering ambiguity. Utilizing lattice
strong coupling expansion, we compute partition function and correlation
functions of the Wilson surfaces. We discover that, at large $N$ limit, the

must be explained if we are to fully understand the different delivery
mechanisms of the volatiles accreted by the terrestrial planets. In this work,
we aim to investigate whether it is possible to quantitatively explain the
variation of the heavy noble gas abundances measured on Venus, the Earth and
Mars, assuming that cometary bombardment was the main delivery mechanism of
these noble gases to the terrestrial planets. To do so, we use recent dynamical
simulations that allow the study of the impact fluxes of comets upon the

Assuming that the mass of noble gases delivered by comets is proportional to
rate at which they collide with the terrestrial planets, we show that the
krypton and xenon abundances in Venus and the Earth can be explained in a
manner consistent with the hypothesis of cometary bombardment. In order to
explain the krypton and xenon abundance differences between the Earth and Mars,
we need to invoke the presence of large amounts of CO2-dominated clathrates in

of the first supermassive black holes, are among the most fundamental
questions. Observations of the highest redshift Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) will be
the most compelling in situ probe of the history of initial star formation and
consequent epoch of reionization if their prompt and precise detection can be
followed immediately by sensitive near-IR imaging and spectroscopy. Blazars are
the persistent analogs of GRBs and for the same reason (beaming) can be
observed at highest redshifts where they might best trace the high accretion
rate-driven jets and growth of supermassive black holes in galaxies. The
proposed EXIST mission can uniquely probe these questions, and many others,
given its unparalled combination of sensitivity and spatial-spectral-temporal
coverage and resolution. Here we provide a brief summary of the mission design,
key science objectives, mission plan and readiness for EXIST, as proposed to

oxides (TCOs) are investigated using first-principles density functional
approach. A detailed comparison of the electronic band structure of
stoichiometric and oxygen deficient In$_2$O$_3$, $\alpha$- and
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, rock salt and wurtzite ZnO, and layered InGaZnO$_4$
reveals the role of the following factors which govern the transport and
optical properties of these TCO materials: (i) the crystal symmetry of the
oxides, including both the oxygen coordination and the long-range structural
anisotropy; (ii) the electronic configuration of the cation(s), specifically,
the type of orbital(s) -- $s$, $p$ or $d$ -- which form the conduction band;
and (iii) the strength of the hybridization between the cation's states and the
p-states of the neighboring oxygen atoms. The results not only explain the
experimentally observed trends in the electrical conductivity in the
single-cation TCO, but also demonstrate that multicomponent oxides may offer a
way to overcome the electron localization bottleneck which limits the charge
transport in wide-bandgap main-group metal oxides. Further, the advantages of
aliovalent substitutional doping -- an alternative route to generate carriers
in a TCO host -- are outlined based on the electronic band structure
calculations of Sn, Ga, Ti and Zr-doped InGaZnO$_4$. We show that the
transition metal dopants offer a possibility to improve conductivity without

the long term relaxation due to film-to-substrate heat diffusion and then
develop a modified three temperature model that gives a consistent account for

However due
to strategic play by buyers, it is not clear whether these are actually
observed in the market. Motivated by the observation that a buyer may derive a
better payoff by feigning a different utility function and thereby manipulating
the Fisher market equilibrium, we formulate the {\em Fisher market game} in
which buyers strategize by posing different utility functions. We show that
existence of a {\em conflict-free allocation} is a necessary condition for the
Nash equilibria (NE) and also sufficient for the symmetric NE in this game.
There are many NE with very different payoffs, and the Fisher equilibrium
payoff is captured at a symmetric NE. We provide a complete polyhedral
characterization of all the NE for the two-buyer market game. Surprisingly, all
the NE of this game turn out to be symmetric and the corresponding payoffs
constitute a piecewise linear concave curve. We also study the correlated
equilibria of this game and show that third-party mediation does not help to
achieve a better payoff than NE payoffs.

emitted. We simulate this effect with the Monte Carlo code REAS2, using
CORSIKA-simulated showers as input. In both codes a routine has been
implemented that treats the effect of the electric field on the shower
particles. We find that the radio pulse is significantly altered in background
fields of the order of ~100 V/cm and higher. Practically, this means that air
showers passing through thunderstorms emit radio pulses that are not a reliable
measure for the shower energy. Under other weather circumstances significant
electric field effects are expected to occur rarely, but nimbostratus clouds
can harbor fields that are large enough. In general, the contribution of the
electric field to the radio pulse has polarization properties that are
different from the geomagnetic pulse. In order to filter out radio pulses that
have been affected by electric field effects, radio air shower experiments
should keep weather information and perform full polarization measurements of

the determinantal torsor D(X). We then introduce a class of exact categories,
that we call partially abelian exact, and prove that if A is partially abelian

reliably identify pre-main sequence (PMS) objects actively undergoing mass
accretion in a resolved stellar population, regardless of their age. The method
does not require spectroscopy and combines broad-band V and I photometry with
narrow-band Halpha imaging to: (1) identify all stars with excess Halpha
emission; (2) derive their Halpha luminosity L(Halpha); (3) estimate the Halpha
emission equivalent width; (4) derive the accretion luminosity L_acc from
L(Halpha); and finally (5) obtain the mass accretion rate M_acc from L_acc and
the stellar parameters (mass and radius). By selecting stars with photometric
accuracy in Halpha better than 15%, the statistical uncertainty on the derived
M_acc is typically <17% and is dictated by the precision of the Halpha
photometry. Systematic uncertainties, of up to a factor of 3 on the value of
M_acc, are caused by our incomplete understanding of the physics of the
accretion process and affect all determinations of the mass accretion rate,
including those based on a spectroscopic Halpha line analysis.
  As an application of our method, we study a field of 9.16 arcmin2 around
SN1987A, using existing HST photometry. We identify as bona-fide PMS stars a
total of 133 objects with a Halpha excess above the 4 sigma level and a median
age of 13.5 Myr. Their median mass accretion rate of 2.6x10-8 Msolar/yr is in
excellent agreement with previous determinations based on the U-band excess of
the stars in this field, and with the value measured for G-type PMS stars in
the Milky Way. Their L_acc shows a strong dependence on their distance from a
group of hot massive stars in the field and suggests that the UV radiation of
the latter is rapidly eroding the circumstellar discs around PMS stars.

all observed distributions, spanning over 6 decades of waiting times ($\Delta t

function, $N(\Delta t) \propto \lambda_0 (1 + \lambda_0 \Delta t)^{-2}$, which
has a powerlaw slope of $p \approx 2.0$ at large waiting times ($\Delta t
\approx 1-1000$ hrs) and flattens out at short waiting times $\Delta t \lapprox

1/\lambda_0 = 0.80\pm0.14$ hours from the WATCH, HXRBS, BATSE, and RHESSI data.
The distribution of waiting times is invariant for sampling with different flux
thresholds, while the mean waiting time scales reciprocically with the number
of detected events, $\Delta t_0 \propto 1/n_{det}$. This waiting time
distribution can be modeled with a nonstationary Poisson process with a flare
rate $\lambda=1/\Delta t$ that varies as $f(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{-1}
\exp{-(\lambda/\lambda_0)}$. This flare rate distribution represents a highly
intermittent flaring productivity in short clusters with high flare rates,
separated by quiescent intervals with very low flare rates.

globally frozen ""snowball"" state poses a threat to the habitability of planets
with the capacity to host water-based life. We use a one-dimensional energy
balance climate model (EBM) to examine how obliquity, spin rate, orbital
eccentricity, and ocean coverage might influence the onset of such a snowball
state. For an exoplanet, these parameters may be strikingly different from the
values observed for Earth. Since, for constant semimajor axis, the annual mean
stellar irradiation scales with (1-e^2)^(-1/2), one might expect the greatest
habitable semimajor axis (for fixed atmospheric composition) to scale as
(1-e^2)^(-1/4). We find that this standard ansatz provides a reasonable lower
bound on the outer boundary of the habitable zone, but the influence of
obliquity and ocean fraction can be profound in the context of planets on
eccentric orbits. For planets with eccentricity 0.5, our EBM suggests that the
greatest habitable semimajor axis can vary by more than 0.8 AU (78%!) depending
on obliquity, with higher obliquity worlds generally more stable against
snowball transitions. One might also expect that the long winter at an
eccentric planet's apoastron would render it more susceptible to global
freezing. Our models suggest that this is not a significant risk for Earth-like
planets around Sun-like stars since such planets are buffered by the thermal
inertia provided by oceans covering at least 10% of their surface. Since
planets on eccentric orbits spend much of their year particularly far from the
star, such worlds might turn out to be especially good targets for direct
observations with missions such as TPF-Darwin. Nevertheless, the extreme
temperature variations achieved on highly eccentric exo-Earths raise questions
about the adaptability of life to marginally or transiently habitable
conditions.

nature of the line, however, means that Lya photons scatter in the neutral
interstellar medium of their host galaxies, and their sensitivity to absorption
by interstellar dust may therefore be enhanced greatly. This implies that the
Lya luminosity may be significantly reduced, or even completely suppressed.
Hitherto, no unbiased empirical test of the escaping fraction (f_esc) of Lya
photons has been performed at high redshifts. Here we report that the average
fesc from star-forming galaxies at redshift z = 2.2 is just 5 per cent by
performing a blind narrowband survey in Lya and Ha. This implies that numerous
conclusions based on Lya-selected samples will require upwards revision by an
order of magnitude and we provide a benchmark for this revision. We demonstrate
that almost 90 per cent of star-forming galaxies emit insufficient Lya to be

global ice-cover shut off the carbonate-silicate cycle, thereby allowing
greenhouse gases to build up to sufficient concentration to melt the ice. Due
to the positive feedback caused by the high albedo of snow and ice,
susceptibility to falling into snowball states might be a generic feature of
water-rich planets with the capacity to host life. This paper has two main
thrusts. First, we revisit one-dimensional energy balance climate models as
tools for probing possible climates of exoplanets, investigate the dimensional
scaling of such models, and introduce a simple algorithm to treat the melting
of the ice layer on a globally-frozen planet. We show that if a terrestrial
planet undergoes Milankovitch-like oscillations of eccentricity that are of
great enough magnitude, it could melt out of a snowball state. Second, we
examine the kinds of variations of eccentricity that a terrestrial planet might
experience due to the gravitational influence of a giant companion. We show
that a giant planet on a sufficiently eccentric orbit can excite extreme
eccentricity oscillations in the orbit of a habitable terrestrial planet. More
generally, these two results demonstrate that the longterm habitability (and
astronomical observables) of a terrestrial planet can depend on the detailed
architecture of the planetary system in which it resides.

of transverse position. The amplitude of the effect in physical units is
predicted with no parameters, by equating the number of degrees of freedom of
position wavefunctions on a 2D spacelike surface with the entropy density of a
black hole event horizon of the same area. In a region of size $L$, the effect
resembles spatially and directionally coherent random transverse shear
deformations on timescale $\approx L/c$ with typical amplitude $\approx
\sqrt{ct_PL}$. This quantum-geometrical ""holographic noise"" in position is not
describable as fluctuations of a quantized metric, or as any kind of
fluctuation, dispersion or propagation effect in quantum fields. In a Michelson
interferometer the effect appears as noise that resembles a random Planckian
walk of the beamsplitter for durations up to the light crossing time. Signal
spectra and correlation functions in interferometers are derived, and predicted
to be comparable with the sensitivities of current and planned experiments. It

150, and 180 degrees (isotropic outflows). Anisotropic outflows follow the path
of least resistance and thus travel preferentially into low-density regions,
away from cosmological structures where galaxies form. These anisotropic
outflows are less likely to overlap with one another, or to hit pre-galactic
collapsing halos and strip them of their gas, preventing a galaxy from forming.
Going from 180 deg to 60 deg, the number of galaxies that actually form
doubles, producing twice as many outflows, and these outflows overlap to a
lesser extent. As a result, the metal volume filling factor of the IGM goes
from 8% for isotropic outflows up to 28% for anisotropic ones. High density
regions are more efficiently enriched than low density ones (~80% compared to
~20% by volume), even though most enriched regions are low densities.
Increasing the anisotropy of outflows increases the extent of enrichment at all
densities, low and high. This is in part because anisotropic outflows are more
numerous. When this effect is factored-out, we find that the probability a
galaxy will enrich systems at densities up to 10 rho_mean is higher for
increasingly anisotropic outflows. This is an effect of the dynamical evolution
of the IGM. Anisotropic outflows expand preferentially into underdense gas, but
that gas can later accrete onto overdense structures.

two-body energies. The coefficients of these linear combinations are rational
and non-negative numbers, independent of the two-body interaction. It is shown
that if in the jn configuration there is only one state with given spin J, its
eigenvalue (the diagonal matrix element) is equal to a linear combination of
two-body energies with rational and non-negative coefficients. These
coefficients have the same values for any two-body interaction (solvable

define a sub-matrix of the interaction which should be diagonalized to yield
eigenvalues and eigenstates. Bases of these states are constructed from which
the sub-matrix characterized by J may be obtained for any two-body interaction.
The diagonal elements are linear combinations of two-body energies whose
coefficients are independent of the two-body interaction and the non-vanishing
ones are rational and positive. Aslo in the non-diagonal elements the

materials from first principles. The central quantity is the transverse spin
susceptibility, from which the complete excitation spectrum, including
single-particle spin-flip Stoner excitations and collective spin-wave modes,
can be obtained. The susceptibility is derived from many-body perturbation
theory and includes dynamic correlation through a summation over ladder
diagrams that describe the coupling of electrons and holes with opposite spins.
In contrast to earlier studies, we do not use a model potential with adjustable
parameters for the electron-hole interaction but employ the random-phase
approximation. To reduce the numerical cost for the calculation of the
four-point scattering matrix we perform a projection onto maximally localized
Wannier functions, which allows us to truncate the matrix efficiently by
exploiting the short spatial range of electronic correlation in the partially
filled d or f orbitals. Our implementation is based on the FLAPW method.
Starting from a ground-state calculation within the LSDA, we first analyze the
matrix elements of the screened Coulomb potential in the Wannier basis for the
3d transition-metal series. In particular, we discuss the differences between a
constrained nonmagnetic and a proper spin-polarized treatment for the
ferromagnets Fe, Co, and Ni. The spectrum of single-particle and collective
spin excitations in fcc Ni is then studied in detail. The calculated spin-wave
dispersion is in good overall agreement with experimental data and contains
both an acoustic and an optical branch for intermediate wave vectors along the
[100] direction. In addition, we find evidence for a similar double-peak
structure in the spectral function along the [111] direction.

mass-loss rates ranging from 8e-9 to 1e-6 Msun/yr, but a comparison to the
distribution of jet mass-loss rates in Orion suggests that we may be missing a
large fraction of the jets below 1e-8 Msun/yr. A key qualitative result is that
even some of the smallest dark globules with sizes of 0.01pc are active sites
of ongoing star formation because we see HH jets emerging from them, and that
these offer potential analogs to the cradle of our Solar System because of
their proximity to dozens of imminent supernovae that will enrich them with
radioactive nuclides like 60Fe. HST images reveal proplyd structures in the
core of the Tr14 cluster, only 0.1-0.2 pc from several O-type stars. Many
examples of bent jets serve as ""wind socks""; strong photoevaporative flows can
shape the jets, competing with the direct winds and radiation from massive
stars. Finally, even allowing for a large number of jets that may escape
detection, we find that HH jets are negligible to the global turbulence of the
surrounding region, which is driven by massive star feedback.

odorants and transmit this information to the cortex. The olfactory code
carried by the mitral cells is sparser than the inputs that they receive. In
this study we analyze the mechanisms and functional significance of sparse
olfactory codes. We consider a model of olfactory bulb containing populations
of excitatory mitral and inhibitory granule cells. We argue that sparse codes
may emerge as a result of self organization in the network leading to the
precise balance between mitral cells' excitatory inputs and inhibition provided
by the granule cells. We propose a novel role for the olfactory granule cells.
We show that these cells can build representations of odorant stimuli that are
not fully accurate. Due to the incompleteness in the granule cell
representation, the exact excitation-inhibition balance is established only for
some mitral cells leading to sparse responses of the mitral cell. Our model
suggests a functional significance to the dendrodendritic synapses that mediate
interactions between mitral and granule cells. The model accounts for the
sparse olfactory code in the steady state and predicts that transient dynamics
may be less sparse.

sufficient to explain the C and N abundances of Galactic AGB stars. We simulate
the effect of extra mixing on the FGB by setting the composition of the
envelope to that observed in low-mass FGB stars, and then evolve the models to
the tip of the AGB. The inclusion of FGB extra mixing compositional changes has
a strong effect on the C and N abundance in our AGB models, leading to
compositions consistent with those measured in Galactic C-rich stars. The
composition of the models is also consistent with C abundances measured in
mainstream silicon carbide grains. While our models cover the range of C
abundances measured in C stars in NGC 1846, we cannot simultaneously match the
composition of the O and C-rich stars. Our models only match the O isotopic
composition of K and some M, MS giants, and are not able to match the O
composition of C-rich AGB stars. By increasing the 16O intershell abundance
(based on observational evidence) it is possible to reproduce the observed
trend of increasing 16O/18O and 16O/17O ratios with evolutionary phase. We
conclude 1) if extra mixing occurs during the AGB it likely only occurs
efficiently in low metallicity objects, or when the stars are heavily obscured
making spectroscopic observations difficult, and 2) that the intershell
compositions of AGB stars needs further investigation.

chromodynamics (QCD) on a space-time lattice. It provides a model-independent
formalism for connecting lattice simulation results at finite volume and a
variety of quark masses to the physical world. The asymptotic nature of the
chiral expansion places the focus on the first few terms of the expansion.
Thus, knowledge of the power-counting regime (PCR) of chiral effective field
theory, where higher-order terms of the expansion may be regarded as
negligible, is as important as knowledge of the expansion itself. Through the
consideration of a variety of renormalization schemes and associated
parameters, techniques to identify the PCR where results are independent of the
renormalization scheme are established. The nucleon mass is considered as a
benchmark for illustrating this general approach. Because the PCR is small, the
numerical simulation results are also examined to search for the possible
presence of an intrinsic scale which may be used in a nonperturbative manner to
describe lattice simulation results outside of the PCR. Positive results that
improve on the current optimistic application of chiral perturbation theory
beyond the PCR are reported.

basic idea of fuzzy spaces. There remains an issue of quantizing time, however,
the idea is simple and it provides an interesting interplay of various ideas in
mathematics and physics. Shedding some light on such an interplay is the main
theme of this dissertation. The dissertation roughly separates into two parts.
In the first part, we consider a mathematical aspect of fuzzy spaces, namely,
their construction. We begin with a review of the construction of fuzzy complex
projective spaces CP^k (k=1,2,...) in relation to geometric quantization. We
then present the construction of fuzzy S^4, utilizing the fact that CP^3 is an
S^2 bundle over S^4. This method is also applicable to the case of fuzzy S^8.
In the second part, we consider applications of fuzzy spaces to physics. We
first consider gravitational theories on fuzzy spaces, anticipating that they
may offer a novel way of regularizing spacetime dynamics. Particularly we
obtain actions for gravity on fuzzy S^2 and fuzzy CP^2. We also discuss
application to M(atrix) theory. Introducing extra potentials, we show that the
theory has new brane solutions whose transverse directions are described by
fuzzy S^4 and fuzzy CP^3. The extra potentials can be interpreted as fuzzy
versions of differential forms or fluxes, which enable us to discuss
compactification models of M(atrix) theory. Compactification down to fuzzy S^4
is discussed and a physically interesting matrix model in four-dimensions is
proposed.

realistic dark energy models on cosmic structure formation. It represents the
largest dynamical dark energy simulation suite to date in term of spatial
dynamics. We first present the 3 realistic dark energy models (calibrated on
latest SNIa and CMB data): LambdaCDM, quintessence with Ratra-Peebles
potential, and quintessence with Sugra potential. We then isolate various
contributions for non-linear matter power spectra from a series of pre-DEUSS
high-resolution simulations (130 million particles). Finally, we introduce
DEUSS which consist in 9 Grand Challenge runs with 1 billion particles each
thus probing scales from 4 Gpc down to 3 kpc at z=0. Our goal is to make these
simulations available to the community through the ""Dark Energy Universe
Virtual Observatory"" (DEUVO), and the ""Dark Energy Universe Simulations"" (DEUS)
consortium.

the magnetic moments is additionally subjected to an uniaxial anisotropy and is
driven by a multiplicative coupled stochastic field with a finite correlation
time $\tau$. The mean value for the spin wave components offers that the
spin-wave dispersion relation and its damping is strongly influenced by the
deterministic Gilbert damping parameter $\alpha$, the strength of the
stochastic forces $D$ and its temporal range $\tau$. The spin-spin-correlation
function can be calculated in the low correlation time limit by deriving an
evolution equation for the joint probability function. The stability analysis
enables us to find the phase diagram within the $\alpha-D$ plane for different
values of $\tau$ where damped spin wave solutions are stable. Even for zero
deterministic Gilbert damping the magnons offer a finite lifetime. We detect a
parameter range where the deterministic and the stochastic damping mechanism
are able to compensate each other leading to undamped spin-waves. The onset is
characterized by a critical value of the correlation time. An enhancement of
$\tau$ leads to an increase of the oscillations of the correlation function.

mass ejection (CME) in the inner corona is closely correlated in time with the
main energy release of the associated solar flare. In this paper, we examine in
detail the post-impulsive-phase acceleration of a CME in the outer corona,
which is the phase of evolution immediately following the main impulsive
acceleration of the CME; this phase is believed to correspond to the decay
phase of the associated flare. This observational study is based on a
statistical sample of 247 CMEs that are associated with M- and X-class GOES
soft X-ray flares from 1996 to 2006. We find that, from many examples of
events, the CMEs associated with flares with long-decay time (or so-called
long-duration flares) tend to have positive post-impulsive-phase acceleration,
even though some of them have already obtained a high speed at the end of the
impulsive acceleration but do not show a deceleration expected from the
aerodynamic dragging of the background solar wind. On the other hand, the CMEs
associated with flares of short-decay time tend to have significant
deceleration. In the scattering plot of all events, there is a weak correlation
between CME post-impulsive-phase acceleration and flare decay time. The CMEs
deviated from the general trend are mostly slow or weak ones associated with
flares of short-decay time; the deviation is caused by the relatively stronger
solar wind dragging force for these events. The implications of our results on
CME dynamics and CME-flare relations are discussed.

eruption to the initiation, and the final acceleration and propagation, of the
CME that occurred on 2008 April 26 using the unprecedented high cadence and
multi-wavelength observations by STEREO. There existed frequent filament
activities and EUV jets prior to the CME eruption for a few days. These
activities were probably caused by the magnetic reconnection in the lower
atmosphere driven by photospheric convergence motions, which were evident in
the sequence of magnetogram images from MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager) onboard
SOHO. The slow low-layer magnetic reconnection may be responsible for the
storage of magnetic free energy in the corona and the formation of a sigmoidal
core field or a flux rope leading to the eventual eruption. The occurrence of
EUV brightenings in the sigmoidal core field prior to the rise of the flux rope
implies that the eruption was triggered by the inner tether-cutting
reconnection, but not the external breakout reconnection. During the period of
impulsive acceleration, the time profile of the CME acceleration in the inner
corona is found to be consistent with the time profile of the reconnection
electric field inferred from the footpoint separation and the RHESSI 15-25 keV
HXR flux curve of the associated flare. The full evolution of this CME can be
described in four distinct phases: the build-up phase, initiation phase, main
acceleration phase, and propagation phase. The physical properties and the
transition between these phases are discussed, in an attempt to provide a
global picture of CME dynamic evolution.

the course of drying. The particles are initially wetted by a liquid brine and
the cohesion of the packing is ensured by capillary forces, but the
crystallization of the solute transforms the liquid bonds into partially
cemented bonds. This transition is evidenced experimentally by measuring the
compressive strength of the samples at regular intervals of times. Our
experimental data reveal three regimes: 1) Up to a critical degree of
saturation, no solid bonds are formed and the cohesion remains practically
constant; 2) The onset of cementation occurs at the surface and a front spreads
towards the center of the sample with a nonlinear increase of the cohesion; 3)
All bonds are partially cemented when the cementation front reaches the center
of the sample, but the cohesion increases rapidly due to the consolidation of
cemented bonds. We introduce a model based on a parametric cohesion law at the
bonds and a bond crystallization parameter. This model predicts correctly the
phase transition and the relation between microscopic and macroscopic cohesion.

is about 300 days, during which the source was in the ""hard"" X-ray spectral

for transient and persistent emission. We report an episode of significant

theoretical implications for current Comptonization models for Cygnus X-1 and

an intervening galaxy at z = 0.394, located 3.2 arcsec away from the line of

random interlacements was first introduced by A.S. Sznitman in arXiv:0704.2560.
It is known that, for small u, almost surely there is a unique infinite
connected component in the vacant set left by the random interlacements at
level u, see arXiv:0808.3344 and arXiv:0805.4106. We estimate here the
distribution of the diameter and the volume of the vacant component at level u
containing the origin, given that it is finite. This comes as a by-product of
our main theorem, which proves a stretched exponential bound on the probability
that the interlacement set separates two macroscopic connected sets in a large
cube. As another application, we show that with high probability, the unique
infinite connected component of the vacant set is `ubiquitous' in large
neighborhoods of the origin.

a set of power-spectra as compressed forms of the bispectrum and trispectrum
derived from CMB temperature and polarization maps; these spectra compress the
information content of the corresponding full multispectra and can be useful in
constraining early Universe theories. We generalize the standard pseudo-C_l
estimators in such a way that they apply to these spectra involving both spin-0
and spin-2 fields, developing explicit expressions which can be used in the
practical implementation of these estimators. While these estimators are
suboptimal, they are nevertheless unbiased and robust hence can provide useful
diagnostic tests at a relatively small computational cost. We next consider
approximate inverse-covariance weighting of the data and construct a set of
near-optimal estimators based on that approach. Instead of combining all
available information from the entire set of mixed bi- or trispectra, i.e
multispectra describing both temperature and polarization information, we
provide analytical constructions for individual estimators, associated with
particular multispectra. The bias and scatter of these estimators can be
computed using Monte-Carlo techniques. Finally, we provide estimators which are
completely optimal for arbitrary scan strategies and involve inverse covariance
weighting; we present the results of an error analysis performed using a
Fisher-matrix formalism at both the one-point and two-point level.

Providing a consistent coupling of source to the lattice in Regge Calculus (RC)
yields a robust unstructured spacetime mesh applicable to both numerical
relativity and quantum gravity. RC provides a particularly insightful approach
to this problem with its purely geometric representation of spacetime. The
simplicial building blocks of RC enable us to represent all matter and fields
in a coordinate-free manner. We provide an interpretation of RC as a discrete
exterior calculus framework into which non-gravitational fields naturally
couple with the simplicial lattice. Using this approach we obtain a consistent
mapping of the continuum action for non-gravitational fields to the Regge
lattice. In this paper we apply this framework to scalar, vector and tensor
fields. In particular we reconstruct the lattice action for (1) the scalar
field, (2) Maxwell field tensor and (3) Dirac particles. The straightforward
application of our discretization techniques to these three fields demonstrates
a universal implementation of coupling source to the lattice in Regge calculus.

recent space probes it is possible to model their rotation with increasing
accuracy. Despite that fact, an accurate determination of Venus precession and
nutation is lacking.
  Aims : Although Venus rotation has been studied in several aspects, a full
and precise analytical model of its precession-nutation motion remains to be
constructed. We propose to determine this motion with up-to-date physical
parameters of the planet
  Methods: We adopt a theoritical framework already used for a precise
precession-nutation model of the Earth, based on a Hamiltonian formulation,
canonical equations and an accurate development of the perturbing function due
to the Sun.
  Results: After integrating the disturbing function and applying the canonical
equations, we can evaluate the precession constant $\dot{\Psi}$ and the
coefficients of nutation, both in longitude and in obliquity. We get
$\dot{\Psi}=4474"".35/Jcy \pm 66.5 $, corresponding to a precession period of
$28965.10 \pm 437$ years. This result, based on recent estimations of the Venus
moment of inertia is significantly different from previous estimations. The
largest nutation coefficient in longitude with an argument $2L_{S}$ (where
$L_{S}$ is the longitude of the Sun) has a 2""19 amplitude and a 112.35 d
period. We show that the coefficients of nutation of Venus due to its
triaxiality are of the same order of amplitude as these values due to its
dynamical flattening, unlike of the Earth, for which they are negligible.

the point of view of statistical physics. Protein folding is a stochastic
process by which a polypeptide folds into its characteristic and functional 3D
structure from random coil. The process involves an intricate interplay between
global geometry and local structure, and each protein seems to present special
problems. We introduce CSAW (conditioned self-avoiding walk), a model of
protein folding that combines the features of self-avoiding walk (SAW) and the
Monte Carlo method. In this model, the unfolded protein chain is treated as a
random coil described by SAW. Folding is induced by hydrophobic forces and
other interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, which can be taken into account
by imposing conditions on SAW. Conceptually, the mathematical basis is a
generalized Langevin equation. To illustrate the flexibility and capabilities
of the model, we consider several examples, including helix formation, elastic
properties, and the transition in the folding of myoglobin. From the CSAW
simulation and physical arguments, we find a universal elastic energy for
proteins, which depends only on the radius of gyration $R_{g}$ and the residue
number $N$. The elastic energy gives rise to scaling laws $R_{g}\sim N^{\nu}$
in different regions with exponents $\nu =3/5,3/7,2/5$, consistent with the
observed unfolded stage, pre-globule, and molten globule, respectively. These
results indicate that CSAW can serve as a theoretical laboratory to study
universal principles in protein folding.

accurate quantitative information about galaxies through the powerful modern
methods of quantitative stellar spectroscopy. The spectral analyis of
individual blue supergiant targets provides invaluable information about
chemical abundances and abundance gradients, which is more comprehensive than
the one obtained from HII regions, as it includes additional atomic species,
and which is also more accurate, since it avoids the systematic uncertainties
inherent in the strong line studies usually applied to the HII regions of
spiral galaxies beyond the Local Group. Simultaneously, the spectral analysis
yields stellar parameters and interstellar extinction for each individual
supergiant target, which provides an alternative very accurate way to determine
extragalactic distances through a newly developed method, called the
Flux-weighted Gravity - Luminosity Relationship (FGLR). With the present
generation of 10m-class telescopes these spectroscopic studies can reach out to
distances of 10 Mpc. The new generation of 30m-class will allow to extend this
work out to 30 Mpc, a substantial volume of the local universe.
