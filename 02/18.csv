$e^+e^-$ collisions is strongly affected by the small lifetime of the top
quark. Since the cross section is defined through final states containing the
top decay products, a consistent definition of the cross section depends on
prescriptions how these final states are accounted for the cross section.
Experimentally, these prescriptions are implemented for example through cuts on
kinematic quantities such as the reconstructed top quark invariant masses. As
long as these cuts do not reject final states that can arise from the decay of
a top and an anti-top quark with a small off-shellness compatible with the
nonrelativistic power-counting, they can be implemented through imaginary phase
space matching conditions in NRQCD. The prescription-dependent cross section
can then be determined from the optical theorem using the $e^+e^-$ forward
scattering amplitude. We compute the phase space matching conditions associated
to cuts on the top and anti-top invariant masses at next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmic (NNLL) order and partially at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmic (N${}^3$LL) order in the nonrelativistic expansion and, together
with finite lifetime and electroweak effects known from previous work, analyze
their numerical impact on the $t\bar t$ cross section. We show that the phase
space matching contributions are essential to make reliable NRQCD predictions,
particularly for energies below the peak region, where the cross section is
small. We find that irreducible background contributions associated to final
states that do not come from top decays are strongly suppressed and can be
neglected for the theoretical predictions.

of the data transfer in such wireless systems. We address the problem of
opportunistic multiuser scheduling under imperfect channel state information,
by exploiting the memory inherent in the channel. In our setting, the channel
between the base station and each user is modeled by a two-state Markov chain
and the scheduled user sends back an ARQ feedback signal that arrives at the
scheduler with a random delay that is i.i.d across users and time. The
scheduler indirectly estimates the channel via accumulated delayed-ARQ feedback
and uses this information to make scheduling decisions. We formulate a
throughput maximization problem as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP). For the case of two users in the system, we show that a greedy
policy is sum throughput optimal for any distribution on the ARQ feedback
delay. For the case of more than two users, we prove that the greedy policy is
suboptimal and demonstrate, via numerical studies, that it has near optimal
performance. We show that the greedy policy can be implemented by a simple
algorithm that does not require the statistics of the underlying Markov channel
or the ARQ feedback delay, thus making it robust against errors in system
parameter estimation. Establishing an equivalence between the two-user system
and a genie-aided system, we obtain a simple closed form expression for the sum
capacity of the Markov-modeled downlink. We further derive inner and outer
bounds on the capacity region of the Markov-modeled downlink and tighten these
bounds for special cases of the system parameters.

in evaluating the lifetimes and disruption mechanisms of the clusters. Two very
different results have been found recently for the age distribution chi(t) of
clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We found that chi(t) can be
described approximately by a power law chi(t) propto t^{gamma}, with gamma
-0.8, by counting clusters in the mass-age plane, i.e., by constructing chi(t)
directly from mass-limited samples. Gieles & Bastian inferred a value of
gamma~, based on the slope of the relation between the maximum mass of clusters
in equal intervals of log t, hereafter the M_max method, an indirect technique
that requires additional assumptions about the upper end of the mass function.
However, our own analysis shows that the M_max method gives a result consistent
with our direct counting method for clusters in the LMC, namely chi(t) propto
t^-0.8 for t<10^9 yr. The reason for the apparent discrepancy is that our
analysis includes many massive (M>1.5x10^3 M_sol), recently formed (t<10^7 yr)
clusters, which are known to exist in the LMC, whereas Gieles & Bastian are
missing such clusters. We compile recent results from the literature showing
that the age distribution of young star clusters in more than a dozen galaxies,
including dwarf and giant galaxies, isolated and interacting galaxies,
irregular and spiral galaxies, has a similar declining shape. We interpret this
approximately ""universal"" shape as due primarily to the progressive disruption
of star clusters over their first ~few x 10^8 yr, starting soon after
formation, and discuss some observational and physical implications of this
early disruption for stellar populations in galaxies.

system ability to suppress interferences as the signals transmitted from two

this paper, we developed an adaptive beamforming based on least mean squared

the presented approach, it is compared to the null steering beamformer which
requires a prior knowledge of directions of arrival (DOAs). The structure of

that the galaxies in HCG 31 follow the same universal scaling relations as
actively star-forming galaxies in the local Universe despite the unusual
compact group environment. Furthermore, the specific frequency of the globular
cluster system is consistent with the low end of galaxies of comparable masses
locally. This, combined with the large mass of neutral hydrogen and tight
constraints on the amount of intragroup light, indicate that the group is
undergoing its first epoch of interaction-induced star formation. In both the
main galaxies and the tidal-dwarf candidate, F, stellar complexes, which are
sensitive to the magnitude of disk turbulence, have both sizes and masses more
characteristic of z=1-2 galaxies. After subtracting the light from compact
sources, we find no evidence for an underlying old stellar population in F --
it appears to be a truly new structure. The low velocity dispersion of the

emission from the z=1.87 luminous submillimeter galaxy (SMG) GOODS 850-3. The
observations were carried out at 1.4 GHz using the High Sensitivity Array
(HSA). Our sensitive tapered VLBI image of GOODS 850-3 at 0.47 x 0.34 arcsec
(3.9 x 2.9 kpc) resolution shows a marginally resolved continuum structure with
a peak flux density of 148 \pm 38 uJy/beam, and a total flux density of 168 \pm
73 uJy, consistent with previous VLA and MERLIN measurements. The derived
intrinsic brightness temperature is > 5 \pm 2 x 10^3 K. The radio continuum
position of this galaxy coincides with a bright and extended near-infrared
source that nearly disappears in the deep HST optical image, indicating a dusty
source of nearly 9 kpc in diameter. No continuum emission is detected at the
full VLBI resolution (13.2 x 7.2 mas, 111 x 61 pc), with a 4-sigma point source
upper limit of 26 uJy/beam, or an upper limit to the intrinsic brightness
temperature of 4.7 x 10^5 K. The extent of the observed continuum source at 1.4
GHz and the derived brightness temperature limits are consistent with the radio
emission (and thus presumably the far-infrared emission) being powered by a
major starburst in GOODS 850-3, with a star formation rate of ~2500 M_sun/yr.
Moreover, the absence of any continuum emission at the full resolution of the
VLBI observations indicates the lack of a compact radio AGN source in this
z=1.87 SMG.

Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) instrument onboard the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft have sparked considerable interest. In our
previous theoretical study of the formation and initial motion of these density
enhancements it is found that beyond the helmet cusp of a coronal streamer the
magnetized wake configuration is resistively unstable, that a traveling
magnetic island develops at the center of the streamer, and that density
enhancements occur within the magnetic islands. As the massive magnetic island
travels outward, both its speed and width increase. The island passively traces
the acceleration of the inner part of the wake.
  In the present paper a few spherical geometry effects are included, taking
into account either the radial divergence of the magnetic field lines and the
average expansion suffered by a parcel of plasma propagating outward, using the
Expanding Box Model (EBM), and the diamagnetic force due to the overall
magnetic field radial gradients, the so-called melon-seed force. It is found
that the values of the acceleration and density contrasts can be in good
agreement with LASCO observations, provided the spherical divergence of the
magnetic lines starts beyond a critical distance from the Sun and the initial
stage of the formation and acceleration of the plasmoid is due to the cartesian
evolution of MHD instabilities. This result provides a constraint on the
topology of the magnetic field in the coronal streamer.

economically be increased. This paper has been presented how the capacity can
be enhanced by using SDMA with smart antennas in mobile communications system.
Based on Adaptive Antenna Array (AAA) technology the spatial dimension of the
existing system is exploited by means of forming independent radio beams in
each of the original channels. This paper analyses the comparison of average
Bit Error Rate (BER) of SDMA and CDMA technique and the different ways in which
SDMA can be introduced to increase the capacity of a cellular system. The
probability of error is found for a standard omni directional base station
antenna, and another set of curves is found for flat top beam having a
directivity of 5.1dB. It is assumed that k separate flat top beams can be
formed by base station and pointed each of the k users within the cell of
interest. Noticing that for an average probability of error greater than 0.1 in
a propagation path loss environment of n=4, the flat top beam will support 200
users, whereas the omni-directional antenna will support only 50 users. This
increase the number of user is roughly equal to the directivity offered by the
flat top beam system, and illustrates the promise SDMA offers for improving
capacity in wireless system. Here multipath fading is not considered.

has many advantages such as less hardware cost, cooling cost, more
manageability. One of the key benefits is better load balancing by using of VM
migration between hosts. To migrate, we must know which virtual machine needs
to be migrated and when this relocation has to be done and, moreover, which
host must be destined. To relocate VMs from overloaded servers to underloaded
ones, we need to sort nodes from the highest volume to the lowest. There are
some models to finding the most overloaded node, but they have some

that have well-measured radio spectra up to at least 23 GHz. The radio spectra
of these objects below 1.4 GHz show a great variety of forms and are rarely a
simple power-law extrapolation of the synchrotron spectra at higher
frequencies. Most objects of this class have spectral turn-overs or bends in
their radio spectra. We interpret these spectra in terms of free-free
absorption in the starburst environment.
  Several objects show radio spectra with two components having free-free
turn-overs at different frequencies (including Arp 220 and Arp 299), indicating
that synchrotron emission originates from regions with very different emission
measures. In these sources, using a simple model for the supernova rate, we
estimate the time for which synchrotron emission is subject to strong free-free
absorption by ionized gas, and compare this to expected HII region lifetimes.
We find that the ionized gas lifetimes are an order of magnitude larger than
plausible lifetimes for individual HII regions. We discuss the implications of
this result and argue that those sources which have a significant radio
component with strong free-free absorption are those in which the star
formation rate is still increasing with time.
  We note that if ionization losses modify the intrinsic synchrotron spectrum
so that it steepens toward higher frequencies, the often observed deficit in
fluxes higher than ~10 GHz would be much reduced.

jets, stars, and disks. The Richardson criterion gives a sufficient condition
for instability of a shear flow in a stratified medium. The velocity gradient
$V'$ can only destabilize a stably stratified medium with squared Brunt-Vaisala
frequency $N^2$ if $V'^2/4>N^2$. We find this is no longer true when the medium
is a magnetized plasma. We investigate the effect of stable stratification on
magnetic field and velocity profiles unstable to magneto-shear instabilities,
i.e., instabilities which require the presence of both magnetic field and shear
flow. We show that a family of profiles originally studied by Tatsuno & Dorland
(2006) remain unstable even when $V'^2/4<N^2$, violating the Richardson
criterion. However, not all magnetic fields can result in a violation of the
Richardson criterion. We consider a class of flows originally considered by
Kent (1968), which are destabilized by a constant magnetic field, and show that
they become stable when $V'^2/4<N^2$, as predicted by the Richardson criterion.
This suggests that magnetic free energy is required to violate the Richardson
criterion. This work implies that the Richardson criterion cannot be used when
evaluating the ideal stability of a sheared, stably stratified, and magnetized
plasma. We briefly discuss the implications for astrophysical systems.

combine the bulk sum rule and a Monte-Carlo evaluation of the Euclidean

range of M_h = 10^9 - 10^12 M_sun. We postprocess several hundred simulated
galaxies with the Authentic Radiative Transfer (ART) code to study the halo
mass dependence of f_esc. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the transfer
of stellar radiation from local stellar population in each dark matter halo. We
find that the average f_esc steeply decreases as the halo mass increases, with
a large scatter for the lower mass haloes. The low mass haloes with M_h ~ 10^9
M_sun have large values of f_esc (with an average of ~ 0.4), whereas the
massive haloes with M_h ~ 10^11 M_sun show small values of f_esc (with an
average of ~ 0.07). This is because in our simulations, the massive haloes show
more clumpy structure in gas distribution, and star-forming regions are
embedded inside these clumps, making it more difficult for the ionizing photons
to escape. On the other hand, in low mass haloes, there are often conical
regions of highly ionized gas due to the shifted location of young star
clusters from the center of dark matter halo, which allows the ionizing photons
to escape more easily than in the high-mass haloes. By counting the number of
escaped ionizing photons, we show that the star-forming galaxies can ionize the
intergalactic medium at z=3-6. The main contributor to the ionizing photons is
the haloes with M_h < 10^10 M_sun owing to their high f_esc. The large
dispersion in f_esc suggests that there may be various sizes of H{\sc ii}
bubbles around the haloes even with the same mass in the early stages of
reionization. We also examine the effect of UV background radiation field on
f_esc using simple, four different treatment of UV background.

previously in the bulge and thought to be associated with a large number of
faint compact sources, extends to the disk of the galaxy with similar X-ray to
K-band luminosity ratio. We also detect excess X-ray emission associated with
the 10-kpc star-forming ring. The L_X/SFR ratio in the 0.5-2 keV band ranges
from zero to ~1.8 x 10^38 (erg/s)/(M_sun/yr), excluding the regions near the
minor axis of the galaxy where it is ~1.5-2 times higher. The latter is likely
associated with warm ionized gas of the galactic wind rather than with the
star-forming ring itself.
  Based on this data, we constrain the nature of Classical Nova (CN)
progenitors. We use the fact that hydrogen-rich material, required to trigger
the explosion, accumulates on the white dwarf surface via accretion. Depending
on the type of the system, the energy of accretion may be radiated at X-ray
energies, thus contributing to the unresolved X-ray emission. Based on the CN
rate in the bulge of M31 and its X-ray surface brightness, we show that no more
than ~10 per cent of CNe can be produced in magnetic cataclysmic variables, the
upper limit being ~3 per cent for parameters typical for CN progenitors. In
dwarf novae, >~90-95 per cent of the material must be accreted during
outbursts, when the emission spectrum is soft, and only a small fraction in

The galaxies, contaminated by emission from ionized ISM, were identified based
on the analysis of radial surface brightness profiles and energy spectra. The
sample was complemented by the bulge of M31 and the data for the solar
neighborhood. To cover a broad range of ages, we also included NGC3377 and
NGC3585. Our final sample includes eight gas-poor galaxies for which we
determine L_X/L_K ratios in the 0.3-0.7 keV energy band. In computing the L_X
we included both unresolved emission and soft resolved sources with the color
temperature of kT_bb <= 200 eV. We find that the X/K luminosity ratios are in
the range of (1.7-3.2) x 10^27 erg/s/L_K,sun. The data show no obvious trends
with mass, age, or metallicity of the host galaxy, although a weak
anti-correlation with the Galactic NH appears to exist. It is much flatter than
predicted for a blackbody emission spectrum with temperature of ~50-75 eV,
suggesting that sources with such soft spectra contribute significantly less
than a half to the observed X/K ratios. However, the correlation of the X/K
ratios with NH has a significant scatter and in the strict statistical sense
cannot be adequately described by a superposition of a power law and a
blackbody components with reasonable parameters, thus precluding quantitative

cosmology) are associated with the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf
stars. The nuclear runaway that leads to the explosion could start in a white
dwarf gradually accumulating matter from a companion star until it reaches the
Chandrasekhar limit, or could be triggered by the merger of two white dwarfs in
a compact binary system. The X-ray signatures of these two possible paths are
very different. Whereas no strong electromagnetic emission is expected in the
merger scenario until shortly before the supernova, the white dwarf accreting
material from the normal star becomes a source of copious X-rays for ~1e7 yr
before the explosion. This offers a means of determining which path dominates.
Here we report that the observed X-ray flux from six nearby elliptical galaxies
and galaxy bulges is a factor of ~30-50 less than predicted in the accretion
scenario, based upon an estimate of the supernova rate from their K-band
luminosities. We conclude that no more than ~5 per cent of Type Ia supernovae
in early type galaxies can be produced by white dwarfs in accreting binary
systems, unless their progenitors are much younger than the bulk of the stellar
population in these galaxies, or explosions of sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs

tripwire being revealed to the intruder. Our scheme combines interaction-free
measurement with the quantum Zeno effect in order to interrogate the presence
of the intruder without interaction. The tripwire exploits a curious nonlinear
behaviour of the quantum Zeno effect we discovered, which occurs in a lossy
system. We also employ a statistical hypothesis testing protocol, allowing us
to calculate a confidence level of interaction-free measurement after a given
number of trials. As a result, our quantum intruder alert system is robust
against photon loss and dephasing under realistic atmospheric conditions and
its design minimizes the probabilities of false positives and false negatives
as well as the probability of becoming visible to the intruder.

prominent features observed in the study of maps depending on a parameter. They
are associated with chaotic behavior, since bifurcation diagrams of a map with
a parameter often reveal a complicated intermingling of period-doubling
cascades and chaos. Period doubling can be studied at three levels of
complexity. The first is an individual period-doubling bifurcation. The second
is an infinite collection of period doublings that are connected together by
periodic orbits in a pattern called a cascade. It was first described by
Myrberg and later in more detail by Feigenbaum. The third involves infinitely
many cascades and a parameter value $\mu_2$ of the map at which there is chaos.
We show that often virtually all (i.e., all but finitely many) ``regular''
periodic orbits at $\mu_2$ are each connected to exactly one cascade by a path
of regular periodic orbits; and virtually all cascades are either paired --
connected to exactly one other cascade, or solitary -- connected to exactly one
regular periodic orbit at $\mu_2$. The solitary cascades are robust to large
perturbations. Hence the investigation of infinitely many cascades is
essentially reduced to studying the regular periodic orbits of $F(\mu_2,
\cdot)$. Examples discussed include the forced-damped pendulum and the
double-well Duffing equation.

foreground galaxy clusters as gravitational telescopes, certain varieties of

orbital characteristics and the system consists of a massive galaxy with a
bulge and disk merging with a much less massive (one-tenth or one-twentieth)
gasless companion which has a variety of morphologies (disk- or
elliptical-like) and central baryonic mass concentrations. During the process
of merging, the orbital angular momentum is redistributed into the internal
angular momentum of the final system; the internal angular momentum of the
primary galaxy can increase or decrease depending on the relative orientation
of the orbital spin vectors (direct or retrograde), while the initially
non-rotating dark matter halo always gains angular momentum. The specific
angular momentum of the stellar component always decreases independent of the
orbital parameters or morphology of the satellite, the decrease in the rotation
velocity of the primary galaxy is accompanied by a change in the anisotropy of
the orbits, and the ratio of rotation speed to velocity dispersion of the
merger remnant is lower than the initial value, not only due to an increase in
the dispersion but also to the slowing -down of the disk rotation. We briefly
discuss several astrophysical implications of these results, suggesting that
minor mergers do not cause a ""random walk"" process of the angular momentum of
the stellar disk component of galaxies, but rather a steady decrease. Minor
mergers may play a role in producing the large scatter observed in the
Tully-Fisher relation for S0 galaxies, as well as in the increase of the

(i.e. ""cuspy"") dark matter (DM) profile introduces on the tidal evolution of
dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our models assume cosmologically-motivated
initial conditions where dSphs are DM-dominated systems on eccentric orbits
about a host galaxy composed of a dark halo and a baryonic disc. We find that
the resilience of dSphs to tidal stripping is extremely sensitive to the halo
cuspiness; whereas dwarfs with a cored profile can be easily destroyed by the
host disc, those with cusps always retain a bound remnant. For a given halo
profile the evolution of the structural parameters as driven by tides is
controlled solely by the total amount of mass lost. This information is used to
construct a semi-analytic code that simulates the hierarchical build-up of
spiral galaxies assuming different halo profiles and disc masses. We find that
tidal encounters with discs tend to decrease the average mass of satellites at
all galactocentric radii. Interestingly, satellites accreted before
re-ionization (z>6), which may be singled out by anomalous metallicity
patterns, survive only if haloes are cuspy. We show that the size-mass relation
established from Milky Way (MW) dwarfs strongly supports the presence of cusps
in the majority of these systems, as cored models systematically underestimate
the masses of the known Ultra-Faint dSphs. Our models also indicate that a
massive M31 disc may explain why many of its dSphs fall below the size-mass
relationship derived from MW dSphs. We use our models to constrain the mass
threshold below which star formation is suppressed in DM haloes, finding that
luminous satellites must be accreted with masses above 10^8--10^9 M_sol in
order to explain the size-mass relation observed in MW dwarfs.

  Sampling the Universe above 10 keV, Otranto, October 2009",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The GeV emission of Gamma Ray Bursts, first detected by EGRET in an handful
of bursts, is now an established property of roughly the 10% of all bursts,
thanks to the Fermi/LAT observations. GRB 090510, a short burst, is
particularly interesting because the good timing allows to derive a severe
limit to theories of quantum gravity. With the dozen bursts detected in the
0.1-30 GeV band so far, we start to see some common properties: (i) the
duration is often longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by
the Gamma Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi; (ii) the spectrum is consistent
with F(v)~v^{-1} with no strong spectral evolution; (iii) for the brightest
bursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power law with a typical
slope: t^{-1.5}; iv) the peak energy of the GBM emission exceeds 500 keV (rest
frame). These properties suggest a similar process for the origin of the GeV
flux. We propose that it is afterglow synchrotron emission shortly following
the start of the prompt phase. The steep decay slope suggests that the fireball
emits in the radiative regime, i.e. all dissipated energy is radiated away. The
large peak energy of the GBM flux suggests that electron-positron pairs might
play a crucial role. The rapid onset, but with some delay, of the GeV flux with
respect to the GBM one suggests that the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of these
bursts is of the order of 1000. Therefore the relatively small fraction of
bursts detected at high energies might correspond to the fraction of bursts
having the largest Gamma. If the emission occurs in the radiative regime we can

solar mass supermassive black holes (SMBH) from the remnants of Population III
stars. The assembly of these lower mass black holes is particularly important
because observing SMBHs in this mass range is one of the primary science goals
for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a planned NASA/ESA mission
to detect gravitational waves. We use high resolution cosmological N-body
simulations to track the merger history of the host dark matter halos, and
model the growth of the SMBHs with a semi-analytic approach that combines
dynamical friction, gas accretion, and feedback. We find that the most common
source in the LISA band from our volume consists of mergers between
intermediate mass black holes and SMBHs at redshifts less than 2.
  This type of high mass ratio merger has not been widely considered in the
gravitational wave community; detection and characterization of this signal
will likely require a different technique than is used for SMBH mergers or
extreme mass ratio inspirals. We find that the event rate of this new LISA
source depends on prescriptions for gas accretion onto the black hole as well
as an accurate model of the dynamics on a galaxy scale; our best estimate
yields about 40 sources with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 30 occur
within a volume like the Local Group during SMBH assembly -- extrapolated over
the volume of the universe yields roughly 500 observed events over 10 years,
although the accuracy of this rate is affected by cosmic variance.

G0.120-0.048, was selected for spectroscopy owing to its detection as a strong
source of Paschen-alpha excess in a recent narrowband imaging survey of the
Galactic center region with HST/NICMOS. The K-band spectrum is similar to that
of the Pistol Star and other known LBVs. The new LBV was previously cataloged
as a photometric variable star, exhibiting brightness fluctuations of up to ~1
mag between 1994 and 1997, with significant variability also occurring on
month-to-month time scales. The luminosity of LBV G0.120-0.048, as derived from
2MASS photometry, is approximately equivalent to that of the Pistol Star.
However, the time-averaged brightness of LBV G0.120-0.048 between 1994 and 1997
exceeded that of the Pistol Star; LBV G0.120-0.048 also suffers more
extinction, which suggests that it was intrinsically more luminous in the
infrared than the Pistol Star between 1994 and 1997. Paschen-alpha images
reveal a thin circular nebula centered on LBV G0.120-0.048 with a physical
radius of ~0.8 pc. We suggest that this nebula is a shell of ejected material
launched from a discrete eruption that occurred between 5000 and 10,000 years
ago. Because of the very short amount of time that evolved massive stars spend
in the LBV phase, and the close proximity of LBV G0.120-0.048 to the Quintuplet
cluster, we suggest that this object might be coeval with the cluster and may
have once resided within it.

reproduce the correct peak in the size distribution of local early-type
galaxies, although it significantly overpredicts the number of very compact and
very large galaxies. This in turn is reflected in the predicted size-mass
relation, much flatter than the observed one, due to too large (~3 kpc)
low-mass galaxies (<10^11 \msun), and to a non-negligible fraction of compact
(< 0.5-1 kpc) and massive galaxies (> 10^11 \msun). We also find that the
latter discrepancy is smaller than previously claimed, and limited to only
ultracompact (Re < 0.5 kpc) galaxies when considering elliptical-dominated
samples. We explore several causes behind these effects. We conclude that the
former problem might be linked to the initial conditions, given that large and
low-mass galaxies are present at all epochs in the model. The survival of
compact and massive galaxies might instead be linked to their very old ages and
peculiar merger histories. Overall, knowledge of the galactic stellar mass {\em

a dynamical binaries in a rotating coordinate system. It is shown that this
version of the solution is time-dependent. It reduces to the later one in the
static case if the rotation goes to zero. The original Curzon solution shows
that there are two singularities at the two masses, while in the modified
version the singularities become on the world-line of the two masses. The
solution shows no additional coordinate singularities. The killing vector field
of the axial symmetry is obtained in the modified version. In addition, the
rotation admits a further rotational symmetry, so a rotation killing vector
field is also obtained and discussed. The equations of motion for a test
particle in the field of a binary system are formulated and solved. Such
equations have been used to study the gravitational time delay of arrival
(Shapiro delay) of signals from binary pulsar systems resulted from our
suggested modifications containing additional terms. These terms are
interpreted as higher order corrections to the masses. In particular we
investigate the gravito-magnetic effect due to orbital angular motion of the
double pulsars. We give numerical estimates of this type of the time delay in
the case of the double-pulsar system PSR J0737-3039 A/B. We draw a model curve

equation with a broken phase symmetry has strictly positive space-time entropy

oscillations in grids of weakly interacting solitons in a class of
Ginzburg-Landau type equations. We provide an analytic proof for the existence
of two-soliton configurations with chaotic temporal behavior, and construct
solutions which are closed to a grid of such chaotic soliton pairs, with every
pair in the grid well spatially separated from the neighboring ones for all
time. The temporal evolution of the well-separated multi-soliton structures is
described by a weakly coupled lattice dynamical system (LDS) for the
coordinates and phases of the solitons. We develop a version of normal
hyperbolicity theory for the weakly coupled LDSs with continuous time and
establish for them the existence of space-time chaotic patterns similar to the
Sinai-Bunimovich chaos in discrete-time LDSs. While the LDS part of the theory
may be of independent interest, the main difficulty addressed in the paper
concerns with lifting the space-time chaotic solutions of the LDS back to the
initial PDE. The equations we consider here are space-time autonomous, i.e. we
impose no spatial or temporal modulation which could prevent the individual
solitons in the grid from drifting towards each other and destroying the
well-separated grid structure in a finite time. We however manage to show that
the set of space-time chaotic solutions for which the random soliton drift is
arrested is large enough, so the corresponding space-time entropy is strictly
positive.

  presentation",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using numerical ray tracing, the paper studies how the average distance
modulus in an inhomogeneous universe differs from its homogeneous counterpart.
The averaging is over all directions from a fixed observer not over all
possible observers (cosmic), thus it is more directly applicable to our
observations. Unlike previous studies, the averaging is exact,
non-perturbative, and includes all possible non-linear effects. The
inhomogeneous universes are represented by Sweese-cheese models containing
random and simple cubic lattices of mass-compensated voids. The Earth observer
is in the homogeneous cheese which has an Einstein - de Sitter metric. For the
first time, the averaging is widened to include the supernovas inside the voids
by assuming the probability for supernova emission from any comoving volume is
proportional to the rest mass in it. Despite the well known argument for photon
flux conservation, the average distance modulus correction at low redshifts is
not zero due to the peculiar velocities. A formula for the maximum possible
average correction as a function of redshift is derived and shown to be in
excellent agreement with the numerical results. The actual average correction
calculated in random and simple cubic void lattices is severely damped below
the predicted maximal average. That is traced to cancelations between the
corrections coming from the fronts and backs of different voids at the same
redshift from the observer. The calculated correction at low redshifts allows
one to readily predict the redshift at which the averaged fluctuation in the
Hubble diagram is below a required precision and suggests a method to extract
the background Hubble constant from low redshift data without the need to
correct for peculiar velocities.

from previous surveys and spectroscopic standard stars. The bright cutoff (M*)
of the PNLF is found by fitting a truncated exponential curve to the bright end
of the PNLF over a 3.4 magnitude range. This cutoff is used to estimate a new
distance modulus of 18.46 to the LMC, in close agreement with previous PNLF
studies and the best estimates by other indicators. The bright end cutoff is
robust to small samples of bright PNe since significantly increased PN samples
do not change this fiducial. We then fit a truncated exponential curve directly
to the bright end of the function over a 6 magnitude range and test the curve's
ability to indicate the position of M*. Because of the significant increase in
the number of LMC PN, the shape of the PNLF is now examined in greater detail
than has previously been possible. Through cumulative functions, the new LMC
PNLF is compared to those from the SMC and a new deep local Galactic sample
revealing the effects of incompleteness. The new [OIII]5007 LMC PNLF is then
compared to our new H-beta LMC PNLF using calibrated and measured fluxes for
the same objects, revealing the effects of metallicity on the [OIII]5007 line.

of more than 1000 km/s. The third phase (the least ionised one) is much slower
at 100 km/s. One of the high ionisation phases, with log xi of 2.4, is found to
have a partial covering fraction of about 60%. It has previously been suggested
that the passage of a cloud, part of a disk wind, in front of the source
(producing a change in the covering fraction) was the cause of a significant
dip in the lightcurve during one of the observations. From our modelling of the
EPIC-pn and RGS spectra, we find that variation in the covering fraction cannot
be solely responsible for this. We show that intrinsic change in the source
continuum plays a much more significant role in explaining the observed flux
and spectral variability than originally thought.

electromagnetic field, there is an apparent puzzle that the matrix element of
the canonical momentum and Hamiltonian operators is gauge dependent. A
resolution to this puzzle is recently provided by us in [2]. Based on the
separation of the electromagnetic potential into pure gauge and gauge invariant
parts, we have proposed a new set of momentum and Hamiltonian operators which
satisfy both the requirement of gauge invariance and the relevant commutation
relations. In this paper we report a check for the case of the hydrogen atom
problem: Starting from the Hamiltonian of the coupled electron, proton and
electromagnetic field, under the infinite proton mass approximation, we derive
the gauge invariant hydrogen atom Hamiltonian and verify explicitly that this
Hamiltonian is different from the Dirac Hamiltonian, which is the time
translation generator of the system. The gauge invariant Hamiltonian is the
energy operator, whose eigenvalue is the energy of the hydrogen atom. It is
generally time-dependent. In this case, one can solve the energy eigenvalue
equation at any specific instant of time. It is shown that the energy
eigenvalues are gauge independent, and by suitably choosing the phase factor of
the time-dependent eigenfunction, one can ensure that the time-dependent
eigenfunction satisfies the Dirac equation.

is crucial in many applications. In particular, for arithmetic lattices it is
useful to have bounds for the strong spectral gap that are uniform in the
family of congruence covers. When the lattice is itself a congruence group,
there are uniform and very good bounds for the spectral gap coming from the
known bounds toward the Ramanujan-Selberg conjectures. In this note, we
establish a uniform bound for the strong spectral gap for congruence covers of
an irreducible co-compact lattice $\Gamma$ in $PSL(2,R)^d$ with $d\geq 2$,
which is the simplest and most basic case where the congruence subgroup

the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR6 in the redshift range 0.00<z<0.06. The
majority of massive early-type galaxies show a negative color gradient
(red-cored) as generally expected for early-type galaxies. On the other hand,
roughly 30 per cent of the galaxies in this sample show a positive color
gradient (blue-cored). These ""blue-cored"" galaxies often show strong H beta
absorption line strengths and/or emission line ratios that are indicative of
the presence of young stellar populations. Combining the optical data with
Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) UV photometry, we find that all blue-cored
galaxies show UV-optical colors that can only be explained by young stellar
populations. This implies that most of the residual star formation in
early-type galaxies is centrally concentrated. Blue-cored galaxies are
predominantly low velocity dispersion systems. A simple model shows that the
observed positive color gradients (blue-cored) are visible only for a billion
years after a star formation episode for the typical strength of recent star
formation. The observed effective radius decreases and the mean surface
brightness increases due to this centrally-concentrated star formation episode.
As a result, the majority of blue-cored galaxies may lie on different regions
in the Fundamental Plane from red-cored ellipticals. However, the position of
the blue-cored galaxies on the Fundamental Plane cannot be solely attributed to
recent star formation but require substantially lower velocity dispersion. We
conclude that a low-level of residual star formation persists at the centers of
most of low-mass early-type galaxies, whereas massive ones are mostly quiescent
systems with metallicity-driven red cores.

This was due to an erroneous positional identification for the star in the

question any association of the nebula with WR 60 as such nebula are usually
quite well centred on the WR stars themselves. We now propose that this fact
combined with our new optical spectra, deeper HAlpha imaging and newly

evolution than the current paradigm predicts. Our new observations, along with
previous literature results, span a wide range of orbital period and CV type.
In general, dwarf novae in which the secondary star is seen show weak to no CO
absorption while polar and pre-CV donor stars appear to have normal CO
absorption for their spectral type. However, this is not universal. The
presence of normal looking CO absorption in the dwarf nova SS Aur and the
hibernating CV QS Vir and a complete lack of CO absorption in the long period
polar V1309 Ori cloud the issue. A summary of the literature pointing to
non-solar abundances including enhanced NV/CIV ratios is presented. It appears
that some CVs have non-solar abundance material accreting onto the white dwarf
suggesting an evolved secondary star while for others CO emission in the
accretion disk may play a role. However, the exact mechanism or combination of
factors causing the CO absorption anomaly in CVs is not yet clear.

possibility that this and other correlations of GRB phenomenology might be used
to make GRBs into standard candles. One recurring apparent difficulty with this
program has been that some of the primary observational quantities to be fit as
""data"" - the isotropic-equivalent prompt energy $E_{iso}$ and the
collimation-corrected ""total"" prompt energy energy $E_{\gamma}$ - depend for
their construction on the very cosmological models that they are supposed to
help constrain. This is the so-called ""circularity problem"" of standard candle
GRBs. This paper is intended to point out that the circularity problem is not
in fact a problem at all, except to the extent that it amounts to a
self-inflicted wound. It arises essentially because of an unfortunate choice of
data variables, such as $E_{iso}$, which are unnecessarily model-dependent. If,
instead, the empirical correlations of GRB phenomenology which are formulated
in source-variables are {\it mapped to the primitive observational variables}
(such as fluence) and compared to the observations in that space, then all
circularity disappears. I also indicate here a set of procedures for encoding
high-dimensional empirical correlations in a ""Gaussian Tube"" smeared model that
includes both the correlation and its intrinsic scatter, and how that
source-variable model may easily be mapped to the space of primitive
observables and fashioned into a likelihood. I discuss the projections of such
Gaussian tubes into sub-spaces, which may be used to incorporate data from GRB
events that may lack some element of the data (for example, GRBs without
ascertained jet-break times). In this way, a large set of inhomogeneously
observed GRBs may be assimilated into a single analysis, so long as each
possesses at least two correlated data attributes.

space by distributions with log-concave density. Approximation means minimizing
a Kullback--Leibler-type functional. We show that such an approximation exists
if and only if $P$ has finite first moments and is not supported by some
hyperplane. Furthermore we show that this approximation depends continuously on
$P$ with respect to Mallows distance $D_1(\cdot,\cdot)$. This result implies
consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator of a log-concave density under
fairly general conditions. It also allows us to prove existence and consistency
of estimators in regression models with a response $Y=\mu(X)+\epsilon$, where
$X$ and $\epsilon$ are independent, $\mu(\cdot)$ belongs to a certain class of
regression functions while $\epsilon$ is a random error with log-concave
density and mean zero.

to multiple receivers in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The objective is to
minimize the weighted sum download time (WSDT) for the one-to-many file
transfer. Previous work has shown that, given an order at which the receivers
finish downloading, the minimum WSD can be solved in polynomial time by convex
optimization, and can be achieved by linear network coding, assuming that node
uplinks are the only bottleneck in the network. This paper, however, considers
heterogeneous peers with both uplink and downlink bandwidth constraints
specified. The static scenario is a file-transfer scheme in which the network
resource allocation remains static until all receivers finish downloading. This
paper first shows that the static scenario may be optimized in polynomial time
by convex optimization, and the associated optimal static WSD can be achieved
by linear network coding. This paper then presented a lower bound to the
minimum WSDT that is easily computed and turns out to be tight across a wide
range of parameterizations of the problem. This paper also proposes a static
routing-based scheme and a static rateless-coding-based scheme which have
almost-optimal empirical performances. The dynamic scenario is a file-transfer
scheme which can re-allocate the network resource during the file transfer.
This paper proposes a dynamic rateless-coding-based scheme, which provides
significantly smaller WSDT than the optimal static scenario does.

in August 2006 with HARPS, followed by an analysis of the data, and a
preliminary modeling of the star (Mosser et al. 2008). The stellar parameters
were significantly constrained, but the behavior of one of the seismic indexes
(the small spacing d01) could not be fitted with the observed one, even with
the best considered models. We study the possibility of improving the agreement
between models and observations by changing the physical properties of the
inner parts of the star (to which d01 is sensitive). We show that, in spite of
its low mass, it is possible to produce models of HD 203608 with a convective
core. No such model was considered in the preliminary modeling. In practice, we
obtain these models here by assuming some extra mixing at the edge of the early
convective core. We optimize the model parameters using the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm. The agreement between the new best model with a convective core and
the observations is much better than for the models without. All the
observational parameters are fitted within 1-sigma observational error bars.
This is the first observational evidence of a convective core in an old and
low-mass star such as HD 203608. In standard models of low-mass stars, the core
withdraws shortly after the ZAMS. The survival of the core until the present
age of HD 203608 provides very strong constraints on the size of the mixed zone
associated to the convective core. Using overshooting as a proxy to model the
processes of transport at the edge of the core, we find that to reproduce both
global and seismic observations, we must have alpha_ov = 0.17 +/- 0.03 Hp for
HD 203608. We revisit the process of the extension of the core lifetime due to
overshooting in the particular case of HD 203608.

governed, perturbatively, at different orders of \alpha', by the perturbatively
evaluated \beta--functions. In regions where \frac{\alpha'}{R_c^2} << 1 the
flow equations at various orders in \alpha' can be thought of as \em
approximating the full, non-perturbative RG flow. On the other hand, taking a
different viewpoint, we may consider the abovementioned RG flow equations as
viable {\em geometric} flows in their own right and without any reference to
the RG aspect. Looked at as purely geometric flows where higher order terms
appear, we no longer have the perturbative restrictions . In this paper, we
perform our analysis from both these perspectives using specific target
manifolds such as S^2, H^2, unwarped S^2 x H^2 and simple warped products. We
analyze and solve the higher order RG flow equations within the appropriate
perturbative domains and find the \em corrections arising due to the inclusion
of higher order terms. Such corrections, within the perturbative regime, are
shown to be small and they provide an estimate of the error which arises when
higher orders are ignored.
  We also investigate the higher order geometric flows on the same manifolds
and figure out generic features of geometric evolution, the appearance of
singularities and solitons. The aim, in this context, is to demonstrate the
role of the higher order terms in modifying the flow. One interesting aspect of
our analysis is that, separable solutions of the higher order flow equations
for simple warped spacetimes, correspond to constant curvature Anti-de Sitter
(AdS) spacetime, modulo an overall flow--parameter dependent scale factor. The
functional form of this scale factor (which we obtain) changes on the inclusion
of successive higher order terms in the flow.

haloes selected from the Millennium Simulation and populated using
semi-analytic models, investigating the relation between observed projected
density and physical 3D density, using densities computed from the 10 and 3
closest neighbours. Both observationally and in the simulations, we study the
relation between number of cluster members and cluster mass, and number of
members per unit of cluster mass. We find that the observed evolution of
projected densities reflects a shift to higher values of the physical 3D
density distribution. In turn, this must be related with the globally higher
number of galaxies per unit of cluster volume N/V in the past. We show that the
evolution of N/V is due to a combination of two effects: a) distant clusters
were denser in dark matter (DM) simply because the DM density within R_{200}
(~the cluster virial radius) is defined to be a fixed multiple of the critical
density of the Universe, and b) the number of galaxies per unit of cluster DM
mass is remarkably constant both with redshift and cluster mass if counting
galaxies brighter than a passively evolving magnitude limit. Our results
highlight that distant clusters were much denser environments than today's
clusters, both in galaxy number and mass, and that the density conditions felt
by galaxies in virialized systems do not depend on the system mass.

equation describes a bosonic system. Here, we analyze on a very fundamental
level, how this equation could be extended to yield a formulation for a general
fermionic distribution of charge and spin. This analysis starts at the level of
single electrons and with the question, how spin actually comes into a charge
distribution in a non-relativistic model. To this end we present a space-time
model of extended electrons, which is formulated in terms of geometric algebra.
Wave properties of the electron are referred to mass density oscillations. We
provide a comprehensive and non-statistical interpretation of wavefunctions,
referring them to mass density components and internal field components. It is
shown that these wavefunctions comply with the Schr\""odinger equation, for the
free electron as well as for the electron in electrostatic and vector
potentials. Spin-properties of the electron are referred to intrinsic field
components and it is established that a measurement of spin in an external
field yields exactly two possible results. The model agrees with the results of
standard theory concerning the hydrogen atom. Finally, we analyze many-electron
systems and derive a set of coupled equations suitable to characterize the
system without any reference to single electron states. The model is expected
to have the greatest impact in condensed matter theory, where it allows to
describe an $N$-electron system by a many-electron wavefunction $\Psi$ of four,
instead of 3N variables. The many-body aspect of a system is in this case
encoded in a bivector potential.

formation of Plutos. A model for the dust produced during self-stirring is
applied to statistics for A stars. As there is no significant difference
between excesses of A-stars <50Myr old, we focus on reproducing the broad
trends, the ""rise and fall"" of the fraction of stars with excesses. Using a
population model, we find that the statistics and trends can be reproduced with
a self-stirring model of planetesimal belts with radii distributed between
15-120AU. Disks must have this 15AU minimum radius to show a peak in disk
fraction, rather than a monotonic decline. Populations of extended disks with
fixed inner and/or outer radii fail to fit the statistics, due mainly to the
slow 70um evolution as stirring moves further out in the disk. This conclusion,
that debris disks are narrow belts, is independent of the significance of 24um
trends for young A-stars. We show that the statistics can also be reproduced
with a model in which disks are stirred by secular perturbations from a nearby
eccentric planet. Detailed imaging is therefore the best way to characterise
the stirring mechanism. From a more detailed look at beta Pictoris Moving Group
and TW Hydrae Association A-stars we find that the disk around beta Pictoris is
likely the result of secular stirring by the proposed planet at ~10AU; the
structure of the HR 4796A disk also points to sculpting by a planet. The two
other stars with disks, HR 7012 and eta Tel, possess transient hot dust, though
the outer eta Tel disk is consistent with a self-stirred origin. Planet
formation provides a natural explanation for the belt-like nature of debris
disks, with inner regions cleared by planets that may also stir the disk, and
the outer edges set by where planetesimals can form. [abridged]

strategic games. This dynamics works as follows: at every stage of the game a
player is selected uniformly at random and she plays according to a ""noisy""
best-response where the noise level is tuned by a parameter $\beta$. Such a
dynamics defines a family of ergodic Markov chains, indexed by $\beta$, over
the set of strategy profiles. We believe that the stationary distribution of
these Markov chains gives a meaningful description of the long-term behavior
for systems whose agents are not completely rational.
  Our aim is twofold: On the one hand, we are interested in evaluating the
performance of the game at equilibrium, i.e. the expected social welfare when
the strategy profiles are random according to the stationary distribution. On
the other hand, we want to estimate how long it takes, for a system starting at
an arbitrary profile and running the logit dynamics, to get close to its
stationary distribution; i.e., the ""mixing time"" of the chain.
  In this paper we study the stationary expected social welfare for the
3-player CK game, for 2-player coordination games, and for two simple
$n$-player games. For all these games, we also give almost tight upper and
lower bounds on the mixing time of logit dynamics. Our results show two
different behaviors: in some games the mixing time depends exponentially on
$\beta$, while for other games it can be upper bounded by a function
independent of $\beta$.

generalized Poland-Scheraga approach and compared to experimental data.
Simultaneous fitting to force-extension data at room temperature and to the
denaturation phase transition at zero force is possible and allows to establish
a global phase diagram in the force-temperature plane. Under a stretching
force, the effects of the stacking energy, entering as a domain-wall energy
between paired and unpaired bases, and the loop entropy are separated.
Therefore we can estimate the loop exponent c independently from the precise

nicks dominate the experimental force extension traces of natural DNA.

M_sun, have not been enriched in both oxygen and nitrogen over the last 3 Gyr:
they have formed their stars in the so distant past that these have returned
their nucleosynthesis products to the interstellar medium before z=0.25. The
galaxies in the mass range from 10^11.0 M_sun to 10^11.2 M_sun do not show an
appreciable enrichment in oxygen, but do show some enrichment in nitrogen: they
also formed their stars before z=0.25 but later in comparison to the galaxies
of highest masses; these stars have not returned nitrogen to the interstellar
medium before z=0.25 because they have not had enough time to evolve. This
suggests that stars with lifetimes of 2-3 Gyr contribute to the nitrogen
production. Finally, galaxies with masses < 10^11 M_sun show enrichment in both
oxygen and nitrogen during the last 3 Gyr: they have undergone appreciable star
formation and have converted up to 20% of their mass into stars over this
period.

prominences/filaments. These oscillations appear to be of local nature, are

that small amplitude oscillations, after excited, are damped in short spatial

Commonly, these oscillations have been interpreted in terms of linear
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, and this paper reviews the theoretical damping
mechanisms that have been recently put forward in order to explain the observed
attenuation scales. These mechanisms include thermal effects, through
non-adiabatic processes, mass flows, resonant damping in non-uniform media, and
partial ionization effects. The relevance of each mechanism is assessed by
comparing the spatial and time scales produced by each of them with those
obtained from observations. Also, the application of the latest theoretical
results to perform prominence seismology is discussed, aiming to determine
physical parameters in prominence plasmas that are difficult to measure by
direct means.

the continuation problem to that of solving a Hamilton--Jacobi equation. The
characteristics of this equation obey Hamiltonian equations of motion, and a
necessary condition for the existence of a continued field across a general

persistent emission. SGR 0418+5729 was monitored almost since its discovery
with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (2-10 keV energy range) and observed many
times with Swift (0.2-10 keV). The source persistent X-ray emission faded by a
factor 10 in about 160 days, with a steepening in the decay about 19 days after
the activation. The X-ray spectrum is well described by a simple absorbed
blackbody, with a temperature decreasing in time. A phase-coherent timing
solution over the 160 day time span yielded no evidence for any significant
evolution of the spin period, implying a 3-sigma upper limit of 1.1E-13 s/s on
the period derivative and of 3E+13 G on the surface dipole magnetic field.
Phase-resolved spectroscopy provided evidence for a significant variation of

two emitting caps, one of which became hotter during the outburst. Finally, a
deep observation of the field of SGR 0418+5729 with the new Gran Telescopio

and quantum compass models on the square lattice by means of Monte Carlo
simulations. An improved algorithm is presented which builds on the Wolff
cluster algorithm in one-dimensional subspaces of the configuration space. This
improvement allows us to study classical systems up to $L=512$. Based on the
new algorithm we give evidence for the presence of strongly anomalous scaling
for periodic boundary conditions which is much worse than anticipated before.
We propose and study alternative boundary conditions for the compass model
which do not make use of extended configuration spaces and show that they
completely remove the problem with finite-size scaling. In the last part, we
apply these boundary conditions to the quantum problem and present a
considerably improved estimate for the critical temperature which should be of
interest for future studies on the compass model. Our investigation identifies
a strong one-dimensional magnetic ordering tendency with a large correlation
length as the cause of the unusual scaling and moreover allows for a precise
quantification of the anomalous length scale involved.

within the hot intracluster medium removes the galaxy's interstellar medium

passive evolution of the stellar populations should be detectable in optical
spectroscopy and multi-wavelength photometry. The goal of our study is to
recover the stripping age of the Virgo spiral galaxy NGC 4388, i.e. the time
elapsed since the halt of star formation in the outer galactic disk using a
combined analysis of optical spectra and photometry. We performed VLT FORS2
long-slit spectroscopy of the inner star-forming and outer gas-free disk of NGC
4388. We developed a non-parametric inversion tool that allows us to
reconstruct the star formation history of a galaxy from spectroscopy and
photometry. The tool was tested on a series of mock data using Monte Carlo
simulations. The results from the non-parametric inversion were refined by
applying a parametric inversion method. The star formation history of the
unperturbed galactic disk is flat. The non-parametric method yields a rapid
decline of star formation < 200 Myr ago in the outer disk. The parametric
method is not able to distinguish between an instantaneous and a long-lasting
star formation truncation. The time since the star formation has dropped by a
factor of two from its pre-stripping value is 190 +- 30 Myr. We are able to
give a precise stripping age that is consistent with revised dynamical models.

significantly distinct in kinematics from their counterparts in quasars. We
argued this previously for the BL lac sources 1803+784 and 0716+714, report
here a similar pattern for another well-known BL Lac object, PKS 0735+178,
whose nuclear jet is found to exhibit kinematics atypical of quasars. Aims. A
detailed study of the jet components' motion reveals that the standard AGN
paradigm of apparent superluminal motion does not always describe the
kinematics in BL Lac objects. We study 0735+178 here to augment and improve the
understanding of the peculiar motions in the jets of BL Lac objects as a class.
Methods. We analyzed 15 GHz VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array) observations
(2cm/MOJAVE survey) performed at 23 epochs between 1995.27 and 2008.91.
Results. We found a drastic structural mode change in the VLBI jet of 0735+178,
between 2000.4 and 2001.8 when its twice sharply bent trajectory turned into a
linear shape.We further found that this jet had undergone a similar transition
sometime between December 1981 and June 1983. A mode change, occurring in the
reverse direction (between mid-1992 and mid-1995) has already been reported in
the literature. These structural mode changes are found to be reflected in
changed kinematical behavior of the nuclear jet, manifested as an apparent
superluminal motion and stationarity of the radio knots. In addition, we found
the individual mode changes to correlate in time with the maxima in the optical
light curve. The last two transitions occurred before a (modest) radio flare.
The behavior of this pc-scale jet appears to favor a scenario involving
non-ballistic motions of the radio knots, produced by the precession of a
continuous jet within the ambient medium.

abundance of the early-type galaxies (E-S0a's) with time is mainly due to major
mergers, reaching opposite conclusions. We have tested it directly through
semi-analytical modelling, by studying how the massive early-type galaxies with
log(M_*/Msun)>11 at z~0 (mETGs) would have evolved backwards-in-time, under the
hypothesis that each major merger gives place to an early-type galaxy. The
study was carried out just considering the major mergers strictly reported by
observations at each redshift, and assuming that gas-rich major mergers
experience transitory phases of dust-reddened, star-forming galaxies (DSFs).
The model is able to reproduce the observed evolution of the galaxy LFs at
z<~1, simultaneously for different rest-frame bands (B, I, and K) and for
different selection criteria on color and morphology. It also provides a
framework in which apparently-contradictory results on the recent evolution of
the luminosity function (LF) of massive, red galaxies can be reconciled, just
considering that observational samples of red galaxies can be significantly
contaminated by DSFs. The model proves that it is feasible to build up ~50-60%
of the present-day mETG population at z<~1 and to reproduce the observational
excess by a factor of ~4-5 of late-type galaxies at 0.8<z<1 through the
coordinated action of wet, mixed, and dry major mergers, fulfilling global
trends that are in general agreement with mass-downsizing. The bulk of this
assembly takes place during ~1 Gyr elapsed at 0.8<z<1. The model suggests that
major mergers have been the main driver for the observational migration of mass
from the massive-end of the blue galaxy cloud to that of the red sequence in
the last ~8 Gyr.(Abridged)

to rotate in order to flip their dipoles in the field direction. Such a

epileptogenic or non epileptogenic areas of the patients in ictal interval or
inter-ictal interval are further investigated employing spatial or temporal
differences of the entropies.

investigation on the charge-density-wave (CDW) superconductor Cu$_x$TiSe$_2$
($x=0.05$ and 0.07). At high magnetic fields where superconductivity is
suppressed, the temperature dependence of $^{77}$Se and $^{63}$Cu spin-lattice
relaxation rates 1/T_{1}$ follow a linear relation. The slope of $^{77}1/T_{1}$
vs \emph{T} increases with the Cu doping. This can be described by a modified
Korringa relation which suggests the significance of electronic correlations
and the Se 4\emph{p}- and Ti 3\emph{d}-band contribution to the density of
states at the Fermi level in the studied compounds.
