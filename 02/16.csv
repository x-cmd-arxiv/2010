the recently released Fermi Large Area Telescope First Source Catalog (1FGL)
with the public sample of UHECRs made available by the Pierre Auger

within 3.1 degrees of Fermi sources. However, we find similar or larger number
of matches in 63 out of 100 artificial UHECR samples constructed using
positions randomly drawn from the BATSE 4B catalog of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)

UHECRs are associated with Fermi sources. We conclude with some remarks about
the astrophysical origin of cosmic rays.

Euler-Beltrami flows. They have the form of coherent structures presenting one

corresponding equations of state. We prove the coexistence of several
equilibrium states for a given value of the control parameter like in 2D
turbulence [Chavanis and Sommeria, J. Fluid Mech. 314, 267 (1996)]. We explore
the stability of these equilibrium states and show that all states are saddle
points of entropy and can, in principle, be destabilized by a perturbation with
a larger wavenumber, resulting in a structure at the smallest available scale.
This mechanism is therefore reminiscent of the 3D Richardson energy cascade
towards smaller and smaller scales. Therefore, our system is truly intermediate
between 2D turbulence (coherent structures) and 3D turbulence (energy cascade).
We further explore numerically the robustness of the equilibrium states with
respect to random perturbations using a relaxation algorithm in both canonical
and microcanonical ensembles. We show that saddle points of entropy can be very
robust and therefore play a role in the dynamics. We evidence differences in
the robustness of the solutions in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles.
A scenario of bifurcation between two different equilibria (with one or two
cells) is proposed and discussed in connection with a recent observation of a
turbulent bifurcation in a von Karman experiment [Ravelet et al., Phys. Rev.

Here we provide for the first time a unified understanding of these puzzling

that the HO phase at finite fields can be explained with a chiral dxy+idx2-y2

contraction of a certain tensor network. The tensors correspond to tetrahedra
in a triangulation of the manifold, with values determined by a fixed spherical
category. For a manifold with boundary, the tensor network has free indices
that can be associated to qudits, and its contraction gives the coefficients of
a quantum error-correcting code. The code has local stabilizers determined by
Levin and Wen. For example, applied to the genus-one handlebody using the Z_2
category, this construction yields the well-known toric code.
  For other categories, such as the Fibonacci category, the construction
realizes a non-abelian anyon model over a discrete lattice. By studying braid
group representations acting on equivalence classes of colored ribbon graphs
embedded in a punctured sphere, we identify the anyons, and give a simple
recipe for mapping fusion basis states of the doubled category to ribbon
graphs. We explain how suitable initial states can be prepared efficiently, how
to implement braids, by successively changing the triangulation using a fixed
five-qudit local unitary gate, and how to measure the topological charge.
Combined with known universality results for anyonic systems, this provides a
large family of schemes for quantum computation based on local deformations of
stabilizer codes. These schemes may serve as a starting point for developing
fault-tolerance schemes using continuous stabilizer measurements and active
error-correction.

over the years has expanded into several areas of mathematics. Here, we propose

Cayley graphs into graph theory. It is proved, that subset S of abelian group G

introduced by Cherkaev and Zhang in J. Comp. Phys. 2009 for approximating the
spectral function of composites from effective properties at different
frequencies. The spectral functions contain microstructure information. Since
this reconstruction problem is ill-posed [9], the well-performed Pade approach
is noteworthy and requires further investigations. In this paper, we validate
the assumption that the effective dielectric component of interest can be
approximated by Pade approximants whose denominator has nonzero power one term.
We refer to this as the nonstandard Pade approximant, in contrast to the
standard approximants with nonzero constant terms. For composites whose
spectral function assumes infinitely many different values, the proof is
carried by using classic results for Stieltjes functions. For those with
spectral functions having only finitely many different values, we prove the
results by utilizing a special product decomposition of the coefficient matrix
of the Pade system. The results in this paper can be considered as an extension
of the Pade theory for Stieltjes functions whose spectral function take
infinitely many different values to those taking only finitely many values. In
the literature, the latter is usually excluded from the definition of Stieltjes
functions because they correspond to rational functions, hence convergence of
their Pade approximants is trivial. However, from an inverse problem point of
view, our main concern is the existence of the nonstandard Pade approximants,
rather than their convergence. The results in this paper provide a mathematical
foundation for applying the Pade approach for reconstructing the spectral
functions of composites whose microstructure is not a priori known.

great advantage of kernels of bell-shaped form has been demonstrated in
few-body nuclear systems. In fact the use of the Lorentz kernel has allowed to
overcome the stumbling block of the ab initio description of reactions to the
full continuum of systems of more than three particles. The problem of finding

requires knowledge of their power spectra and other parameters. If these are
not known a priori, they have to be measured simultaneously from the same data

inference in the presence of unknown parameters within the framework of
information field theory. We develop a generic parameter uncertainty
renormalized estimation (PURE) technique and address the problem of
reconstructing Gaussian signals with unknown power-spectrum with five different
approaches: (i) separate maximum-a-posteriori power spectrum measurement and
subsequent reconstruction, (ii) maximum-a-posteriori power reconstruction with
marginalized power-spectrum, (iii) maximizing the joint posterior of signal and
spectrum, (iv) guessing the spectrum from the variance in the Wiener filter
map, and (v) renormalization flow analysis of the field theoretical problem
providing the PURE filter. In all cases, the reconstruction can be described or
approximated as Wiener filter operations with assumed signal spectra derived
from the data according to the same recipe, but with differing coefficients.
All of these filters, except the renormalized one, exhibit a perception
threshold in case of a Jeffreys prior for the unknown spectrum. Data modes,
with variance below this threshold do not affect the signal reconstruction at
all. Filter (iv) seems to be similar to the so called Karhune-Loeve and
Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock estimators for galaxy power spectra used in cosmology,
which therefore should also exhibit a marginal perception threshold if
correctly implemented. We present statistical performance tests and show that
the PURE filter is superior to the others.

hidden behind the Milky Way, and also provides redshifts for partially-obscured

survey, two low-latitude precursor regions were observed, totalling 138 square
degrees, with 72 HI galaxies detected. Detections through the inner Galaxy
generally have no cataloged counterparts in any other waveband, due to the
heavy extinction and stellar confusion. Detections through the outer Galaxy are
more likely to have 2MASS counterparts. We present the results of these
precursor observations, including a catalog of the detected galaxies, with
their HI parameters. The survey sensitivity is well described by a flux- and
linewidth-dependent signal-to-noise ratio of 6.5. ALFA ZOA galaxies which also
have HI measurements in the literature show good agreement between our
measurements and previous work. The inner Galaxy precursor region was chosen to
overlap the HI Parkes Zone of Avoidance Survey so ALFA performance could be
quickly assessed. The outer Galaxy precursor region lies north of the Parkes

an overdensity of galaxies near l = 183 deg and between 5000 - 6000 km/s in the

right-handed fermions and the PS-symmetry breaking Higgs field transform
identically under the PS symmetry, causing unnatural matter-Higgs mixing
effects. We argue that this problem could be solved in particular D-brane
setups where these fields arise in different intersections. We further observe
that whenever a large Higgs mass term is generated in a particular class of
mass spectra, a splitting mechanism -reminiscent of the doublet triplet
splitting- may protect the neutral Higgs components from a heavy mass term. We
analyze the implications of each individual representation which in principle
is available in these models in order to specify the minimal spectrum required
to build up a consistent PS model which reconciles the low energy data. A short
discussion is devoted on the effects of stringy instanton corrections,
particularly those generating missing Yukawa couplings and contributing to the
fermion mass textures. We discuss the correlations of the intersecting D-brane
spectra with those obtained from Gepner constructions and analyze the
superpotential, the resulting mass textures and the low energy implications of
some examples of the latter along the lines proposed above.

(QLC) is an exact regularity. Equal solar and atmospheric deviations from exact
QLC constitute one of the main inferences at next to leading approximation.
That universal violation of exact QLC advances the status of the QLC idea; and
the more so, as that deviation from QLC is quantitatively estimated and used
for accurate calculations of lepton mixing angles. Quark and neutrino Dirac
CP-violating phases are determined by the considered quadratic hierarchy
paradigm in flavor phenomenology. Inferences are partly supported by quark
heavy flavor unitarity triangle angles and testable at B-factory and LHC b

with the quark CP-violating phase to within ~5x10-4. The final quark CKM mixing

an astronomical observatory. The planned telescopes and instrumentation and the
unique site characteristics are conducive toward Type Ia supernova surveys for
cosmology. A self-contained search and survey over five years can yield a
spectro-photometric time series of ~1000 z<0.08 supernovae. These can serve to
anchor the Hubble diagram and quantify the relationship between luminosities
and heterogeneities within the Type Ia supernova class, reducing systematics.
Larger aperture (>4-m) telescopes are capable of discovering supernovae shortly
after explosion out to z~3. These can be fed to space telescopes, and can
isolate systematics and extend the redshift range over which we measure the
expansion history of the universe.

discrepancy between the observed and theoretical values of the apsidal motion
rate dw/dt of the eccentric eclipsing binary DI Her, which has even been
interpreted occasionally as a possible failure of General Relativity (GR).
Recent observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect have shown convincingly
that the reason for the anomaly is that the rotational axes of the stars and
the orbital axis are misaligned, which changes the predicted rate of precession
significantly. Although as a result of those measurements the disagreement is
now drastically smaller, it remains formally at the level of 50%, possibly due
to errors in the measured apsidal motion rate, outdated stellar models, or
inaccuracies in the stellar parameters. Here we address each of these issues in
order to improve the agreement further. New times of minimum have been
collected in order to redetermine the apsidal motion rate. We have computed new
stellar evolution models with updated physical inputs, and derived improved
apsidal motion constants for the components. We have performed Monte Carlo
simulations to infer the theoretical distribution of dw/dt, including the
contributions from GR as well as tidal and rotational distortions. All
observational errors have been accounted for. Our simulations yield a
retrograde apsidal motion rate due to the rotationally-induced oblateness of
-0.00056 deg/cycle (mode of the distribution), a GR contribution of +0.00068
deg/cycle, and a tidal contribution of +0.00034 deg/cycle, leading to a total
predicted rate of +0.00046 deg/cycle. This is in excellent agreement with the
newly measured value of +0.00042 deg/cycle. The formal difference is now
reduced to 10%, a small fraction of the observational uncertainties. (abridged)

undercompressive shock waves and formulate a well-posed initial value problem
for nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Such nonclassical waves
arise in weak solutions of a large variety of physical models: phase
transitions, thin liquid films, magnetohydrodynamics, Camassa-Holm model,
martensite-austenite materials, semi-conductors, combustion theory, etc. This
review presents the research done in the last fifteen years which led the
development of the theory of kinetic relations for undercompressive shocks and
has now covered many physical, mathematical, and numerical issues. The main
difficulty overcome here in our analysis of nonclassical entropy solutions
comes from their lack of monotonicity with respect to initial data.
Undercompressive shocks of hyperbolic conservation laws turn out to exhibit
features that are very similar to shocks of nonconservative hyperbolic systems,
who were investigated earlier by the author.

pattern analysis. A PCD is a random directed graph (i.e., digraph) which is
constructed from data using the relative positions of the points from various
classes. Different PCDs result from different definitions of the proximity
region associated with each data point. We consider the underlying and
reflexivity graphs based on a family of PCDs which is determined by a family of
parameterized proximity maps called proportional-edge (PE) proximity map. The
graph invariant we investigate is the relative edge density of the underlying
and reflexivity graphs. We demonstrate that, properly scaled, relative edge
density of these graphs is a $U$-statistic, and hence obtain the asymptotic
normality of the relative edge density for data from any distribution that
satisfies mild regulatory conditions. By detailed probabilistic and geometric
calculations, we compute the explicit form of the asymptotic normal
distribution for uniform data on a bounded region in the usual Euclidean plane.
We also compare the relative edge densities of the two types of the graphs and
the relative arc density of the PE-PCDs. The approach presented here is also
valid for data in higher dimensions.

lack of extremely metal-poor stars, below [Fe/H]=-3, found in classical dwarf
galaxies around the Milky Way using this technique. The question arises whether
these stars are really absent, or if the empirical Ca II triplet method used to

capacity of cellular networks. In contrast to existing cellular systems,
femtocells are end-user deployed and controlled, randomly located, and rely on
third party backhaul (e.g. DSL or cable modem). Femtocells can be configured to
be either open access or closed access. Open access allows an arbitrary nearby
cellular user to use the femtocell, whereas closed access restricts the use of
the femtocell to users explicitly approved by the owner. Seemingly, the network
operator would prefer an open access deployment since this provides an
inexpensive way to expand their network capabilities, whereas the femtocell
owner would prefer closed access, in order to keep the femtocell's capacity and
backhaul to himself. We show mathematically and through simulations that the
reality is more complicated for both parties, and that the best approach
depends heavily on whether the multiple access scheme is orthogonal (TDMA or
OFDMA, per subband) or non-orthogonal (CDMA). In a TDMA/OFDMA network,
closed-access is typically preferable at high user densities, whereas in CDMA,
open access can provide gains of more than 200% for the home user by reducing
the near-far problem experienced by the femtocell. The results of this paper
suggest that the interests of the femtocell owner and the network operator are

  In this paper, we construct asymmetric quantum codes to protect quantum

methods are presented to derive asymmetric quantum cyclic codes using the

predicts dark matter in the TeV range, including naturally tiny mass splittings
between pseudo-Dirac states. By the AdS/CFT correspondence both the dark photon

constant alpha_s at low energies, since it can be related to a weighted
integral of the Adler function in the complex energy plane. Using Operator
Product Expansion, one sees that the sensitivity to alpha_s comes from the
perturbative contribution, which can be obtained by integrating the
perturbative expansion of the Adler function. Two different prescriptions
proposed to perform this integral, called Fixed-Order Perturbation Theory and
Contour-Improved Perturbation Theory (FOPT and CIPT), yield different results
for the strong coupling constant. Recently, models for the Adler function based
on renormalon calculus have been proposed to determine which of the two methods
is the most accurate, by comparing the resulting asymptotic series with the
true value of the integral. We discuss the assumptions of such ansatz and the
determination of their free parameters. We show that variations of this
renormalon ansatz can yield opposite conclusions concerning the comparison of
CIPT versus FOPT, and that such models are not constrained enough to provide a
definite answer on this issue or to be exploited for a high-precision

viscous accretion discs. In this regime warps are know to propagate
diffusively, with a diffusion coefficient approximately inversely proportional
to the disc viscosity. Previous numerical investigations of this problem
(Lodato & Pringle 2007) did not find a good agreement between the numerical
results and the predictions of the analytic theories of warp propagation, both
in the linear and in the non-linear case. Here, we take advantage of a new,
low-memory and highly efficient SPH code to run a large set of very high
resolution simulations (up to 20 million SPH particles) of warp propagation,
implementing an isotropic disc viscosity in different ways, to investigate the
origin of the discrepancy between the theory and the numerical results. Our new
and improved analysis now shows a remarkable agreement with the analytic theory
both in the linear and in the non-linear regime, in terms of warp diffusion
coefficient and precession rate. It is worth noting that the resulting
diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the disc viscosity only for
small amplitude warps and small values of the disc $\alpha$ coefficient
($\alpha < 0.1$). For non-linear warps, the diffusion coefficient is a function
of both radius and time, and is significantly smaller than the standard value.
Warped accretion discs are present in many contexts, from protostellar discs to
accretion discs around supermassive black holes. In all such cases, the exact
value of the warp diffusion coefficient may strongly affect the evolution of
the system and therefore its careful evaluation is critical in order to
correctly estimate the system dynamics (abridged).

(Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithms) or stub-matching based (the Configuration
Model). Both types are ill-controlled, with typically unknown mixing times for
link-swap methods and uncontrolled rejections for the Configuration Model. Here
we propose an efficient, polynomial time algorithm that generates statistically
independent graph samples with a given, arbitrary, degree sequence. The
algorithm provides a weight associated with each sample, allowing the
observable to be measured either uniformly over the graph ensemble, or,
alternatively, with a desired distribution. Unlike other algorithms, this
method always produces a sample, without back-tracking or rejections. Using a
central limit theorem-based reasoning, we argue, that for large N, and for
degree sequences admitting many realizations, the sample weights are expected
to have a lognormal distribution. As examples, we apply our algorithm to
generate networks with degree sequences drawn from power-law distributions and
from binomial distributions.

We are particularly concerned with the development of understanding of the
thermodynamic phases of matter. The question is how can matter, ordinary
matter, support a diversity of forms. We see this diversity each time we
observe ice in contact with liquid water or see water vapor (steam) rise from a
pot of heated water. The nature of the phases is brought into the sharpest
focus in phase transitions: abrupt changes from one phase to another and hence
changes from one behavior to another. This article starts with the development
of mean field theory as a basis for a partial understanding of phase transition
phenomena. It then goes on to the limitations of mean field theory and the
development of very different supplementary understanding through the
renormalization group concept.
  Throughout, the behavior at the phase transition is illuminated by an
""extended singularity theorem"", which says that a sharp phase transition only
occurs in the presence of some sort of infinity in the statistical system. The
usual infinity is in the system size. Apparently this result caused some
confusion at a 1937 meeting celebrating van der Waals, since mean field theory
does not respect this theorem. In contrast, renormalization theories can make
use of the theorem. This possibility, in fact, accounts for some of the
strengths of renormalization methods in dealing with phase transitions. The
paper outlines the different ways phase transition phenomena reflect the
effects of this theorem.

model for conformal/walking Technicolor. If this theory possess an infrared
fixed point, as indicated by 2-loop perturbation theory, it is a
conformal(unparticle) field theory. If, on the other hand, a chiral condensate
forms on the weak-coupling side of this would-be fixed point, the theory
remains confining. The only difference between such a theory and regular QCD is
that there is a range of momentum scales over which the coupling constant runs
very slowly (walks). In this first analysis, we simulate the lattice version of
QCD with two flavours of staggered quarks at finite temperatures on lattices of
temporal extent $N_t=4$ and 6. The deconfinement and chiral-symmetry
restoration couplings give us a measure of the scales associated with
confinement and chiral-symmetry breaking. We find that, in contrast to what is
seen with fundamental quarks, these transition couplings are very different.
$\beta=6/g^2$ for each of these transitions increases significantly from
$N_t=4$ and $N_t=6$ as expected for the finite temperature transitions of an
asymptotically-free theory. This suggests a walking rather than a conformal
behaviour, in contrast to what is observed with Wilson quarks. In contrast to
what is found for fundamental quarks, the deconfined phase exhibits states in
which the Polyakov loop is oriented in the directions of all three cube roots
of unity. At very weak coupling the states with complex Polyakov loops undergo
a transition to a state with a real, negative Polyakov loop.

optimal bond potential amplitudes (represented by an effective Peclet number)
and initial bond configurations that yield the most efficient numerical
reconstruction of simple potentials. Furthermore, we show that reconstruction
of more complex potentials containing multiple minima can be achieved by
simultaneously using two or more measured FPT distributions, obtained under
different physical conditions. For example, by changing the effective potential
energy surface by known amounts, additional measured FPT distributions improve
the reconstruction. We demonstrate the possibility of reconstructing potentials

effect of gas in three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, in which the
wide region from a protoplanetary gas disk to a Jovian radius planet is
resolved using the nested-grid method. We estimate the mass accretion rate and
growth timescale of gas giant planets. The mass accretion rate increases with
protoplanet mass for M_p < M_cri, while it becomes saturated or decreases for
M_p > M_cri, where M_cri = 0.036 M_Jup (a_p/1AU)^0.75, and M_Jup and a_p are
the Jovian mass and the orbital radius, respectively. The growth timescale of a
gas giant planet or the timescale of the gas accretion onto the protoplanet is
about 10^5 yr, that is two orders of magnitude shorter than the growth
timescale of the solid core. The thermal effects barely affect the mass
accretion rate because the gravitational energy dominates the thermal energy
around the protoplanet. The mass accretion rate obtained in our local
simulations agrees quantitatively well with those obtained in global
simulations with coarser spatial resolution. The mass accretion rate is mainly
determined by the protoplanet mass and the property of the protoplanetary disk.
We find that the mass accretion rate is correctly calculated when the Hill or
Bondi radius is sufficiently resolved. Using the oligarchic growth of
protoplanets, we discuss the formation timescale of gas giant planets.

diffraction may be important when nearby substellar objects lens occult distant
stars. In particular the effects of diffraction become more important as the
wavelength of the observation increases. Typically if the wavelength of the
observation is comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of lensing object,
diffraction leaves an observable imprint on the lensing signature. The
commissioning of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) over the next decade begs the
question of whether it will become possible to follow up lensing events with
radio observations because the SKA may have sufficient sensitivity to detect
the typical sources, giant stars in the bulge. The detection of diffractive
lensing in a lensing event would place unique constraints on the mass of the
lens and its distance. In particular it would distinguish rapidly moving
stellar mass lenses (e.g. neutron stars) from slowly moving substellar objects
such freely floating planets. An analysis of the sensitivity of the SKA along
with new simple closed-form estimates of the expected signal applied to local
exemplars for stellar radio emission reveals that this effect can nearly be
detected with the SKA. If the radio emission from bulge giants is stronger than
expected, the SKA could detect the diffractive microlensing signature from
Earth-like interstellar planets in the solar neighborhood.

  Stars Orbiting Blue Stragglers","29 pages, 6 figures, 1 table; submitted to The Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1088/0004-6256/141/5/142",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Kepler's first major discoveries are two hot objects orbiting stars in its
field. These may be the cores of stars that have each been eroded or disrupted
by a companion star. The companion, which is the star monitored today, is
likely to have gained mass from its now-defunct partner, and can be considered
to be a blue straggler. KOI-81 is almost certainly the product of stable mass
transfer; KOI-74 may be as well, or it may be the first clear example of a blue
straggler created throughthree-body interactions.
  We show that mass transfer binaries are common enough that Kepler should
discover ~1000 white dwarfs orbiting main sequence stars. Most, like KOI-74 and
KOI-81, will be discovered through transits, but many will be discovered
through a combination of gravitational lensing and transits, while lensing will
dominate for a subset. In fact, some events caused by white dwarfs will have
the appearance of ""anti-transits"" --i.e., short-lived enhancements in the
amount of light received from the monitored star. Lensing and other mass
measurements methods provide a way to distinguish white dwarf binaries from
planetary systems. This is important for the success of Kepler's primary
mission, in light of the fact that white dwarf radii are similar to the radii
of terrestrial planets, and that some white dwarfs will have orbital periods
that place them in the habitable zones of their stellar companions. By
identifying transiting and/or lensing white dwarfs, Kepler will conduct
pioneering studies of white dwarfs and of the end states of mass transfer. It
may also identify orbiting neutron stars or black holes. The calculations
inspired by the discovery of KOI-74 and KOI-81 have implications for
ground-based wide-field surveys as well as for future space-based surveys.

in Sgr A*. Roughly speaking, they correspond to the quiescent and flare states
of the source respectively. The high-resolution {\it Chandra} observations to
the gas at the Bondi radius combined with the Bondi accretion theory, the
spectral energy distribution from radio to X-ray, and the radio polarization
provide us strict constraints and abundant information to the theory of
accretion. We review these observational results and describe how the
advection-dominated accretion flow model explains these observations. Recently
more attentions have been paid to flares in Sgr A*. Many simultaneous
multi-wavelength campaigns have been conducted, aiming at uncovering the nature
of flares. The main observational properties of flares are briefly reviewed.
Especially, the time lag between the peaks of flare at two radio frequencies
strongly indicates that the flare is associated with ejection of radio-emitting
blobs from the underlying accretion flow. Such kind of episodic jets is
distinctive from the continuous jets and are quite common in black hole
systems. We introduce the magnetohydrodynamical model for the formation of
episodic jets recently proposed based on the analogy with the theory of coronal
mass ejection in the Sun. We point out that the various observational
appearances of flares should be explained in the framework of this model, since
ejection and flare originate from the same physical process.

employ this methodology to determine the bulk viscosity of Millipore water over
a temperature range of 7 to 50 degrees Celsius. The measured attenuation
spectra are consistent with the theoretical predictions, while the bulk

in the vicinity of a quantum critical point, these correlations strongly

  We review our current understanding of the functional role of emotions,
stressing the role of the neuromodulators mediating emotions for the diffusive

emotional diffusive control is characterized, in contrast to neutral diffusive

effect was found to be small in comparison to the magnetic splitting. The
measured mean magnetic field modulus varies from 2.5 to 3.5kG, while the mean
quadratic field was found to vary in the range of 3.5 to 4.8kG. To determine
the period of variations, we used radial velocity, equivalent width, line
width, and line asymmetry measurements of variable spectral lines of several
elements, as well as magnetic field measurements. The most pronounced
variability was detected for spectral lines of He I and the iron peak elements,
whereas the spectral lines of CNO elements are only slightly variable. From
spectral variations and magnetic field measurements we derived a potential
rotation period P_rot=13.86d, which has to be proven in future studies with a
larger number of observations. It is the first time that the presence of

study of Herbig Ae stars revealed a trend towards stronger magnetic fields for
younger Herbig Ae stars, confirmed by statistical tests. This is in contrast to
a few other (non-statistical) studies claiming that magnetic Herbig Ae stars
are progenitors of the magnetic Ap stars. New developments in MHD theory show
that the measured magnetic field strengths are compatible with a current-driven

demonstrate that in the limit $-t \ge m_V^2 +Q^2$ the cross section does not
contain double logarithmic terms in any order of the DGLAP approximation
leading to the energy independent cross section. Thus the energy dependence of
cross section $\gamma^*+p\to J/\psi+{\rm rapidity ~gap} +X$ is governed at
large $t$ by the gluon distribution within a proton, i.e. it is unambiguously
predicted within the DGLAP approximation including the stronger $W_{\gamma N}$

calculations which follow perturbative Pomeron logic predict opposite trend of
a weaker $W_{\gamma N}$ dependence at larger $t$. We explain that at the HERA
energies double logarithmic terms characteristic for DGLAP approximation
dominate in the hard processes as the consequence of constraints due to
energy-momentum conservation. We give predictions for ultraperipheral hard

that would follow a brief burst of star formation - can shed light on SN
progenitors, and on chemical enrichment timescales. Previous attempts to
recover the DTD have used comparisons of mean SN rates vs. redshift to cosmic
star-formation history (SFH), or comparison of SN rates among galaxies of
different mean ages. We present an approach to recover the SN DTD that avoids
such averaging. We compare the SFHs of individual galaxies to the numbers of
SNe discovered in each galaxy (generally zero, sometimes one or a few SNe). We
apply the method to a subsample of 3505 galaxies, hosting 82 SNe Ia and 119
core-collapse SNe (CC SNe), from the Lick Observatory SN Search (LOSS), with
SFHs reconstructed from SDSS spectra. We find a >2sigma SN Ia DTD signal in our
shortest-delay, ""prompt"", bin at <420 Myr. Despite a systematic error, due to
the limited aperture of the SDSS spectroscopic fibres, which causes some of the
prompt signal to leak to the later DTD bins, the data require prompt SNe Ia at
the >99% confidence. We further find, at 4sigma, SNe Ia that are ""delayed"" by >
2.4 Gyr. Thus, the data support the existence of both prompt and delayed SNe
Ia. The time integral over the CC SN DTD is 0.010+/-0.002 SNe per Msun, as
expected if all stars of mass >8 Msun lead to visible SN explosions. This
argues against a minimum mass for CC SNe of >10 Msun, and against a significant
fraction of massive stars that collapse without exploding. For SNe Ia, the
time-integrated DTD is 0.0023+/-0.0006 SNe per Msun formed, most of them with
delays < 2.4 Gyr. We show, using simulations, that application of the method to
the full existing LOSS sample, but with complete and unbiased SFH estimates for
the survey galaxies, could provide a detailed measurement of the SN Ia DTD.

described with a new chemical reaction network. We consider the effect of the

20 Msun counterpart produces ~ 0.103 Msun. Our results point to smaller amounts
of dust formed in the ejecta of Pop. III supernovae by a factor ~ 5 compared to
values derived by previous studies, and to different dust chemical composition.
Such deviations result from some erroneous assumptions made, the inappropriate
use of classical nucleation theory to model dust formation, and the omission of
the synthethis of molecules in supernova ejecta. Unmixed ejecta of massive Pop.
III supernovae chiefly form silica and/or silicates, and pure silicon grains
whereas their lower mass counterparts form a dust mixture dominated by silica
and/or silicates, pure silicon and iron sulphides. Amorphous carbon can only
condense in ejecta where the carbon-rich zone is deprived of He+. The first
dust enrichment to the primordial gas in the early universe from Pop. III
massive supernova comprises primarily pure silicon, silica and silicates. If
carbon dust is present at redshift z> 6, alternative dust sources must be

spatial degrees of freedom limitation. To address the worst case scenario, we
consider a free-space line-of-sight type environment with no scattering and no

determined by how the area of the network A, normalized with respect to the
wavelength lambda, compares to the number of users n. In networks with
sqrt{A}/lambda < sqrt{n}, the limitation in spatial degrees of freedom does not
allow to achieve a capacity scaling better than sqrt{n} and this performance
can be readily achieved by multi-hopping. This result has been recently shown
by Franceschetti et al. However, for networks with sqrt{A}/lambda > sqrt{n},
the number of available degrees of freedom is min(n, sqrt{A}/lambda), larger
that what can be achieved by multi-hopping. We show that the optimal capacity
scaling in this regime is achieved by hierarchical cooperation. In particular,
in networks with sqrt{A}/lambda> n, hierarchical cooperation can achieve linear
scaling.

to a better understanding of failed star formation processes and binary
statistics with different environmental conditions. Methods: Using UKIDSS data
and their cross-correlation with the SDSS, we searched for high proper motion
mid- to late-T dwarf candidates with extremely blue near-infrared (J-K<0) and
very red optical-to-near-infrared (z-J>+2.5) colours. Results: With 11 newly
found T dwarf candidates, the proper motions of which range between 100 and 800
mas/yr, we increased the number of UKIDSS T dwarf discoveries by $\approx$30%.
Large proper motions were also measured for six of eight previously known

T5-T9 dwarfs based on their colours. Two of these objects were found to be
common proper motion companions of Hipparcos stars with accurate parallaxes.
The latter allow us to determine absolute magnitudes from which we classify Hip

COSMOS field with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts from the zCOSMOS 10k

studies as the mass below which the population of blue early-type galaxies
starts to be abundant relative to passive E/S0s, evolves from log(M*/Msol)~10.1
at z~0.3 to log(M*/Msol)~10.9 at z~1. Second, there seems to be a turn-over
mass in the nature of blue E/S0 galaxies. Above log(M*/Msol)~10.8 blue E/S0
resemble to merger remnants probably migrating to the red-sequence in a
time-scale of ~3 Gyr. Below this mass, they seem to be closer to normal
late-type galaxies as if they were the result of minor mergers which triggered
the central star-formation and built a central bulge component or were
(re)building a disk from the surrounding gas, suggesting that they are moving
back or staying in the blue-cloud. This turn-over mass does not seem to evolve
significantly from z~1 in contrast with the threshold mass and therefore does
not seem to be linked with the relative abundance of blue E/S0s.

condensation in the Infinite-Range Bose-Hubbard Model. We obtain an expression
for the cycle density involving the partition function for a Bose-Hubbard
Hamiltonian with a single-site correction. Inspired by the Approximating
Hamiltonian method we conjecture a simplified expression for the short cycle
density as a ratio of single-site partition functions. In the absence of
condensation we prove that this simplification is exact and use it to show that
in this case the long-cycle density vanishes. In the presence of condensation
we can justify this simplification when a gauge-symmetry breaking term is
introduced in the Hamiltonian. Assuming our conjecture is correct, we compare
numerically the long-cycle density with the condensate and find that though
they coexist, in general they are not equal.

The CME maximum acceleration is achieved at heights h < 0.4 Rs, the peak

  Study",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic Spectrum Access systems exploit temporarily available spectrum
(`white spaces') and can spread transmissions over a number of non-contiguous
sub-channels. Such methods are highly beneficial in terms of spectrum
utilization. However, excessive fragmentation degrades performance and hence
off-sets the benefits. Thus, there is a need to study these processes so as to
determine how to ensure acceptable levels of fragmentation. Hence, we present
experimental and analytical results derived from a mathematical model. We model
a system operating at capacity serving requests for bandwidth by assigning a
collection of gaps (sub-channels) with no limitations on the fragment size. Our
main theoretical result shows that even if fragments can be arbitrarily small,
the system does not degrade with time. Namely, the average total number of
fragments remains bounded. Within the very difficult class of dynamic
fragmentation models (including models of storage fragmentation), this result
appears to be the first of its kind. Extensive experimental results describe
behavior, at times unexpected, of fragmentation under different algorithms. Our
model also applies to dynamic linked-list storage allocation, and provides a
novel analysis in that domain. We prove that, interestingly, the 50% rule of
the classical (non-fragmented) allocation model carries over to our model.
Overall, the paper provides insights into the potential behavior of practical
fragmentation algorithms.

couplings of the Higgs and lepton fields to the SU(2) gauge bosons, these
differ from the standard model couplings. The theory also expounds upon the
standard model results for the masses of the charged fields in the model and
has other significant physical implications. The model is rooted in the notion
that very light charged particles traveling next to superconducting cosmic
strings [12] at distances on the order of the compactification size of the

magnetic fields that interact with the particle fields on the UED manifold.

  Shanghai",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The observed super-massive black hole (SMBH) mass -- galaxy velocity
dispersion ($M_{\rm cmo} - \sigma$) correlation, and the similar correlation
for nuclear star clusters, may be established when winds/outflows from the CMO
(""central massive object"") drive gas out of the potential wells of classical
bulges. Timescales of growth for these objects may explain why smaller bulges
appear to host preferentially NCs while larger ones contain SMBHs only.
  Despite much recent progress, feedback processes in bulge/galaxy formation
are far from being understood. Our numerical simulations show that that
understanding how the CMO feeds is as important a piece of the puzzle as
understanding how its feedback affects its host galaxy.

to significantly increase our capabilities to understand the many basic
phenomena taking place in the Sun at all atmospheric layers and how they relate
to each other. A (non-exaustive) summary of the main scientific arguments we
have to pursue these impressive technological goals is presented. We illustrate
how imaging, polarimetry, and spectroscopy can benefit from the new telescopes
and how several wavelength bands should be observed to study the atmospheric
coupling from the upper convection zone all the way to the corona. The
particular science case of sunspot penumbrae is barely discussed as a specific
example.
