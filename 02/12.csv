the initial state depends on what is measured in the final state. Parton
distribution functions (PDFs) evolved to the hard collision scale Q are
appropriate for inclusive observables, but not for measurements with a specific
number of hard jets, leptons, and photons. Here the incoming protons are probed
and lose their identity to an incoming jet at a scale \mu_B << Q, and the
initial state is described by universal beam functions. We discuss the
field-theoretic treatment of beam functions, and show that the beam function
has the same RG evolution as the jet function to all orders in perturbation
theory. In contrast to PDF evolution, the beam function evolution does not mix
quarks and gluons and changes the virtuality of the colliding parton at fixed
momentum fraction. At \mu_B, the incoming jet can be described perturbatively,
and we give a detailed derivation of the one-loop matching of the quark beam
function onto quark and gluon PDFs. We compute the associated NLO Wilson
coefficients and explicitly verify the cancellation of IR singularities. As an
application, we give an expression for the next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic
order (NNLL) resummed Drell-Yan beam thrust cross section.

of the pseudogap Kondo model with finite chemical potential mu. While carrier
doping restores conventional Kondo screening at lowest energies, properties of
the quantum critical fixed point turn out to influence the behavior over a
large parameter range. Most importantly, the Kondo temperature T_K shows an
extreme asymmetry between electron and hole doping. At criticality, depending
on the sign of mu, T_K follows either the scaling prediction T_K ~ |mu| with a
universal prefactor, or T_K ~ |mu|^x with x = 2.6. This asymmetry between
electron and hole doping extends well outside the quantum critical regime and
also implies a qualitative difference in the shape of the tunneling spectra for
both signs of mu.

the energy-momentum tensor. The most widely known such multiplet, the
Ferrara-Zumino (FZ) multiplet, is not always well-defined. This can happen once
Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) terms are present or when the Kahler form of the target
space is not exact. We present a new multiplet S which always exists. This
understanding of the supersymmetry current allows us to obtain new results
about the possible IR behavior of supersymmetric theories. Next, we discuss the
coupling of rigid supersymmetric theories to supergravity. When the theory has
an FZ-multiplet or it has a global R-symmetry the standard formalism can be
used. But when this is not the case such simple gauging is impossible. Then, we
must gauge the current S. The resulting theory has, in addition to the graviton
and the gravitino, another massless chiral superfield Phi which is essential
for the consistency of the theory. Some of the moduli of various string models
play the role of Phi. Our general considerations, which are based on the
consistency of supergravity, show that such moduli cannot be easily lifted thus
leading to constraints on gravity/string models.

morphology measurements of the simulated systems to measurements of the
original galaxies. AGN contributions >20 per cent bias most of the morphology
measurements tested, though the extent of the apparent bias depends on the
morphological characteristics of the original galaxies. We test colour
measurements by adding to non-AGN galaxy spectra a quasar spectrum scaled to
contribute specified fractions of the rest-frame B band light detected from the
resulting systems. A quasar fraction of 5 per cent can move the NUV-r colour of
an elliptical galaxy from the UV-optical red sequence to the green valley, and
20 per cent can move it into the blue cloud. Combining the colour and
morphology results, we find that a galaxy/AGN system with an AGN contribution
>20 per cent may appear bluer and more bulge-dominated than the underlying
galaxy. We conclude that (1) bulge-dominated, E/S0/Sa, and early-type
morphology classifications are accurate for red AGN host galaxies and may be
accurate for blue host galaxies, unless the AGN manifests itself as a
well-defined point source; and (2) although highly unobscured AGNs, such as the
quasar used for our experiments, can significantly bias the measured colours of
AGN host galaxies, it is possible to identify such systems by examining optical
images of the hosts for the presence of a point source and/or measuring the
level of nuclear obscuration.

1 \'{a} 1.5 GeV, while corroborating the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger prediction
for the gluon propagator. We also discuss the infinite volume extrapolation,

intense burst of star formation 10 to 40 Myr ago. We present observations that
reach surface brightnesses two to eighty times fainter than previous radio
continuum observations and the first radio continuum polarization observations.
These observations allow us to probe the relationship of the magnetic field of
NGC 1569 to the rest of its interstellar medium. We confirm the presence of an
extended radio continuum halo at 20 cm and see for the first time the radio
continuum feature associated with the western Halpha arm at wavelengths shorter
than 20cm. The spectral index trends in this galaxy support the theory that
there is a convective wind at work in this galaxy. We derive a total magnetic
field strength of 38 microG in the central regions and 10-15 microG in the
halo. The magnetic field is largely random in the center of the galaxy; the
uniform field is ~3-9 microG and is strongest in the halo. We find that the
magnetic pressure is the same order of magnitude but, in general, a factor of a
few less than the other components of the interstellar medium in this galaxy.
The uniform magnetic field in NGC 1569 is closely associated with the Halpha
bubbles and filaments. We suggest that a supernova-driven dynamo may be
operating in this galaxy. The outflow of hot gas from NGC 1569 is clearly
shaping the magnetic field, but the magnetic field in turn may be aiding the
outflow by channeling gas out of the disk of the galaxy. Dwarf galaxies with
extended radio continuum halos like that of NGC 1569 may play an important role
in magnetizing the intergalactic medium.

self-force acting on a pointlike particle in a generic (bound) geodesic orbit
around a Schwarzschild black hole. The calculation is carried out in the Lorenz
gauge: For a given geodesic orbit, we decompose the Lorenz-gauge metric
perturbation equations (sourced by the delta-function particle) into tensorial
harmonics, and solve for each harmonic using numerical evolution in the time
domain (in 1+1 dimensions). The physical self-force along the orbit is then
obtained via mode-sum regularization. The total self-force contains a
dissipative piece as well as a conservative piece, and we describe a simple
method for disentangling these two pieces in a time-domain framework. The
dissipative component is responsible for the loss of orbital energy and angular
momentum through gravitational radiation; as a test of our code we demonstrate
that the work done by the dissipative component of the computed force is
precisely balanced by the asymptotic fluxes of energy and angular momentum,
which we extract independently from the wave-zone numerical solutions. The
conservative piece of the self force does not affect the time-averaged rate of
energy and angular-momentum loss, but it influences the evolution of the
orbital phases; this piece is calculated here for the first time in eccentric
strong-field orbits. As a first concrete application of our code we recently
reported the value of the shift in the location and frequency of the innermost
stable circular orbit due to the conservative self-force [Phys. Rev. Lett.\

member of a binary asteroid. We performed more than eight thousand numerical
simulations of capture trajectories considering the four-body dynamical system
Sun, Jupiter, Binary-asteroid. We restricted the problem to the circular planar
prograde case, and time of integration to 10^4 years. With respect to the
binary features, we noted that 1) tighter binaries are much more susceptible to
produce permanent captures than the large separation-ones. We also found that
2) the permanent capture probability of the minor member of the binary is much
more expressive than the major body permanent capture probability. On the other
hand, among the aspects of capture-disruption process, 4) a pseudo
eastern-quadrature was noted to be a very likely capture angular configuration

generally reliable and any segment loss in a transmission is due to congestion
in the network rather than an unreliable medium (The assumptions is that the
packet loss caused by damage is much less than 1 percent) . This notion doesnt
hold in wireless parts of the network. Wireless links are highly unreliable and
they lose segments all the time due to a number of factors. Very few papers are
available which uses TCP for MANET. In this paper, an attempt have been made to
justify the use of TCP variants (Tahoe and Reno) for loss of packet due to
random noise introduces in the MANET. For the present analysis the simulation
has been carried out for TCP variants (Tahoe and Reno) by introduces 0, 10, 20
and 30 percent noise. The comparison of TCP variants is made by running
simulation for 0, 10, 20 and 30 percent of data packet loss due to noise in the
transmission link and the effect of throughput and congestion window has been
examined. During the simulation we have observed that throughput has been
decreased when a drop of multiple segments happens, further we have observed in
the case of TCP variant (Reno) throughput is better at 1 percent (Figure 5)
which implies a network with short burst of error and low BER, causing only one
segment to be lost. When multiple segments are lost due to error prone nature
of link, Tahoe perform better than Reno (Figure 13), that gives a significant
saving of time (64.28 percent) in comparison with Reno (Table 4). Several
simulations have been run with ns 2 simulator in order to acquire a better
understanding of these TCP variants and the way they perform their function. We
conclude with a discussion of whether these TCP versions can be used in Mobile
Ad hoc Network.

bases on the fundamental quantum feature: incompatibility of measurements of
quantum non-commuting observables. In 1991 Ekert showed that cryptographic key
can be generated at a distance with help of entangled (correlated) quantum
particles. Recently Barrett, Hardy and Kent showed that the non-locality used
by Ekert is itself a good resource of cryptographic key even beyond quantum
mechanics. Their result paved the way to new generation of quantum
cryptographic protocols - secure even if the devices are built by the very
eavesdropper. However, there is a question, which is fundamental from both
practical and philosophical point of view: does Nature offer security on
operational level based on the original concept behind quantum cryptography -
that information gain about one bservables must cause disturbance to another,
incompatible one?
  Here we resolve this problem by using in place of non-locality another
striking feature of quantum world - contextuality. It is a strong version of
incompatibility manifested in the famous Kochen-Specker paradox. The crucial
concept is the use of a new class of families of bipartite probability
distributions which locally exhibit the Kochen-Specker paradox conditions and,
in addition, exhibit perfect correlations. We show that if two persons share
systems described by such a family then they can extract secure key.
  This is the first operational protocol that directly implements the
fundamental feature of Nature: the information gain vs. disturbance trade-off.
At the same time it provides natural device-independent cryptographic scheme
within quantum mechanics suitable for current technology.

untie viruses, secondly the functionality of the file is not still functioning.
In this paper, a new information hiding system is presented. The aim of the
proposed system is to hide information (data file) within image page of
execution file (EXEfile) to make sure changes made to the file will not be
detected by universe and the functionality of the exe.file is still functioning
after hiding process. Meanwhile, since the cover file might be used to identify

A2alpha and A2beta recently detected in this system are still present, and have
moved roughly symmetrically away from source A2 at a projected velocity of
30-80 km s-1. This confirms that A2alpha and A2beta were formed as a
consequence of a very recent bipolar ejection from A2. Powerful bipolar
ejections have long been known to occur in low-mass young stars, but this is
-to our knowledge-- the first time that such a dramatic one is observed from
its very beginning. Under the reasonable assumption that the flux detected at
radio wavelengths is optically thin free-free emission, one can estimate the
mass of each ejecta to be of the order of 10^-8 Msun. If the ejecta were
created as a consequence of an episode of enhanced mass loss accompanied by an
increase in accretion onto the protostar, then the total luminosity of IRAS
16293-2422 ought to have increased by 10-60% over the course of at least
several months. Between A2alpha and A2beta, component A2 has reappeared, and
the relative position angle between A2 and A1 is found to have increased
significantly since 2003-2005. This strongly suggests that A1 is a protostar
rather than a shock feature, and that the A1/A2 pair is a tight binary system.
Including component B, IRAS 16293-2422 therefore appears to be a very young
hierarchical multiple system.

is simply the quantum analogue of this interpolation. Contrary to previous

generators. It has been showed by X. Dai, D. R. Larson, and D. M. Speegle in
[11] that for any $d\times d$ real-valued expansive matrix M, a homogeneous
orthonormal M-wavelet basis can be generated by a single wavelet function. On
the other hand, it has been demonstrated in [21] that nonhomogeneous wavelet
systems, though much less studied in the literature, play a fundamental role in
wavelet analysis and naturally link many aspects of wavelet analysis together.
In this paper, we are interested in nonhomogeneous wavelet systems in high
dimensions with a minimum number of generators. As we shall see in this paper,
a nonhomogeneous wavelet system naturally leads to a homogeneous wavelet system
with almost all properties preserved. We also show that a nonredundant
nonhomogeneous wavelet system is naturally connected to refinable structures
and has a fixed number of wavelet generators. Consequently, it is often
impossible for a nonhomogeneous orthonormal wavelet basis to have a single
wavelet generator. However, for redundant nonhomogeneous wavelet systems, we
show that for any $d\times d$ real-valued expansive matrix M, we can always
construct a nonhomogeneous smooth tight M-wavelet frame in $L_2(R^d)$ with a
single wavelet generator whose Fourier transform is a compactly supported
$C^\infty$ function. Moreover, such nonhomogeneous tight wavelet frames are
associated with filter banks and can be modified to achieve directionality in
high dimensions. Our analysis of nonhomogeneous wavelet systems employs a
notion of frequency-based nonhomogeneous wavelet systems in the distribution
space. Such a notion allows us to separate the perfect reconstruction property
of a wavelet system from its stability in function spaces.

larger groups. For many groups however, there is no list of members from which
to take a random sample. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a relatively new
sampling methodology that circumvents this difficulty by using the social
networks of the groups under study. The RDS method has been shown to provide
unbiased estimates of population proportions given certain conditions. The
method is now widely used in the study of HIV-related high-risk populations
globally. In this paper, we test the RDS methodology by simulating RDS studies
on the social networks of a large LGBT web community. The robustness of the RDS
method is tested by violating, one by one, the conditions under which the
method provides unbiased estimates. Results reveal that the risk of bias is
large if networks are directed, or respondents choose to invite persons based
on characteristics that are correlated with the study outcomes. If these two
problems are absent, the RDS method shows strong resistance to low response
rates and certain errors in the participants' reporting of their network sizes.
Other issues that might affect the RDS estimates, such as the method for
choosing initial participants, the maximum number of recruitments per
participant, sampling with or without replacement and variations in network
structures, are also simulated and discussed.

higher-dimensional conventional superstring vacua, where spacetime
supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by geometrical fluxes. We find that the

induced by the fluxes. This correspondence is extended to less symmetric cases
where the initial MSDS symmetry is reduced by orbifolds. We also exhibit and
analyse thermal interpretations of some Euclidean versions of the models and
identify classes of MSDS vacua that remain tachyon-free under arbitrary
marginal deformations about the extended symmetry point. The connection between
the two-dimensional MSDS vacua and the resulting four-dimensional effective
supergravity theories arises naturally within the context of an adiabatic
cosmological evolution, where the very early Universe is conjectured to be

here is generally different from other models, and in particular those with a
wino dominated LSP, in that here the gluinos can be significantly lighter. The
positron excess reported by the PAMELA satellite data is accounted for by
annihilations of the wino LSP and their relic abundance can generally be
brought near the WMAP constraints due to the late decay of a modulus field
re-populating the density of relic dark matter. We also mention the recent

the variational parameter space, cluster size, and boundary conditions of the

Specifically, the variational cluster approach is applied to the
one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, which exhibits a quantum phase transition
from Mott to superfluid phase. In order to benchmark the variational cluster
approach, results for the phase boundary delimiting the first Mott lobe are
compared with essentially exact density matrix renormalization group data.
Furthermore, static quantities, such as the ground state energy and the
one-particle density matrix are compared with high-order strong coupling
perturbation theory results. For reference systems with open boundary
conditions the variational parameter space is extended by an additional
variational parameter which allows for a more uniform particle density on the
reference system and thus drastically improves the results. It turns out that
the variational cluster approach yields accurate results with relatively low
computational effort for both spectral as well as static properties of the

These results suggest that non-LTE effects may need to be considered when
interpreting measurements of strongly irradiated exoplanets.

23 proteins that display a variety of conformational motions upon ligand
binding (e.g. shear, hinge, allosteric). In most cases, PRS determines residues
that may be manipulated to achieve the resulting conformational change. PRS
reveals that for some proteins, binding induced conformational change may be
achieved through the perturbation of residues scattered throughout the protein,
whereas in others, perturbation of specific residues confined to a highly
specific region are necessary. Correlations between the experimental and
calculated atomic displacements are always better or equivalent to those
obtained from a modal analysis of elastic network models. Furthermore, best
correlations obtained by the latter approach do not always appear in the most
collective modes. We show that success of the modal analysis depends on the
lack of redundant paths that exist in the protein. PRS thus demonstrates that
several relevant modes may simultaneously be induced by perturbing a single
select residue on the protein. We also illustrate the biological relevance of
applying PRS on the GroEL and ADK structures in detail, where we show that the
residues whose perturbation lead to the precise conformational changes usually
correspond to those experimentally determined to be functionally important.

consequence of this imbalance, a perfectly conducting channel is stabilized in
the coherent regime if intervalley scattering is absent. We show that even in

evolution for low- and intermediate-mass stars, which are fundamental
contributors to the mass return to the interstellar medium and to the chemical
evolution of galaxies. The detailed understanding of mass loss processes is
hampered by the poor knowledge of the luminosities and distances of AGB stars.
Aims. In a series of papers we are trying to establish criteria permitting a
more quantitative determination of luminosities for the various types of AGB
stars, using the infrared (IR) fluxes as a basis. An updated compilation of the
mass loss rates is also required, as it is crucial in our studies of the
evolutionary properties of these stars. In this paper we concentrate our
analysis on the study of the mass loss rates for a sample of galactic S stars.
Methods. We reanalyze the properties of the stellar winds for a sample of
galactic MS, S, SC stars with reliable estimates of the distance on the basis
of criteria previously determined. We then compare the resulting mass loss
rates with those previously obtained for a sample of C-rich AGB stars. Results.
Stellar winds in S stars are on average less efficient than those of C-rich AGB
stars of the same luminosity. Near-to-mid infrared colors appear to be crucial
in our analysis. They show a good correlation with mass loss rates in
particular for the Mira stars. We suggest that the relations between the rates
of the stellar winds and both the near-to-mid infrared colors and the periods
of variability improve the understanding of the late evolutionary stages of low
mass stars and could be the origin of the relation between the rates of the
stellar winds and the bolometric magnitudes.

spatially resolved nebulosity in near-infrared scattering light. To directly
derive the parameters of a circumstellar disk around FN Tau, observations of
dust continuum emission at 340 GHz are carried out with the Submillimeter Array
(SMA). A point-like dust continuum emission was detected with a synthesized
beam of ~ 0.7"" in FWHM. From the analysis of the visibility plot, the radius of
the emission is estimated to be <= 0.29"", corresponding to 41 AU. This is much
smaller than the radius of the nebulosity, 1.85"" for its brighter part at 1.6
micron. The 340 GHz continuum emission observed with the SMA and the
photometric data at lambda <= 70 micron are explained by a power-law disk model
whose outer radius and mass are 41 AU and (0.24 - 5.9) x 10^{-3} M_{sun},
respectively, if the exponent of dust mass opacity (beta) is assumed to be 0-2.
The disk model cannot fully reproduce the flux density at 230 GHz obtained with
the IRAM 30-meter telescope, suggesting that there is another extended ""halo""
component that is missed in the SMA observations. By requiring the halo not to
be detected with the SMA, the lower limit to the size of the halo is evaluated
to be between 174 AU and 574 AU, depending on the assumed beta value. The
physical nature of the halo is unclear, but it may be the periphery of a flared
circumstellar disk that is not described well in terms of a power-law disk
model, or a remnant of a protostellar envelope having flattened structure.

flavor-diagram approach. Fits to the $SP$ modes with $S$ being a non-strange
scalar meson show that neither the simple $q\bar q$ picture nor the $q^2\bar
q^2$ scheme is favored by data. Current measurements on the $AP$ decays are
insufficient for a meaningful analysis. Some $TP$ data are inconsistent with
the others. In certain cases, the $W$-annihilation diagrams indicated by the
data are unexpectedly large. As a comparison, we also compute their decay rates
in the factorization approach using form factors extracted from the covariant
light-front model. We find that factorization works well for Cabibbo-allowed
$D^+ \to SP,AP$ decays free of the weak annihilation contributions
($W$-exchange or $W$-annihilation). For the other $SP$ and $AP$ modes, it is
necessary to include weak annihilation contributions to account for the data.
However, factoriztion fails for $D\to TP$ decays for some unknown reason; the
predicted rates are in general too small by at least two orders of magnitude
compared to experiment. We also examine the finite width effects of resonances.
Some decay modes which are kinematically forbidden become physically allowed
due to the finite width of the resonance. We show that the branching fraction
of $D^+\to\sigma\pi^+$ extracted from three-body decays is enhanced by a factor
of 2, whereas $\B(D^0\to f_2(1270)\ov K^0)$ is reduced by a factor of 4 by
finite width effects.

well-known intensity correction factor due to the dispersion of the measured

to explain the divergence. Another source of systematic energy determination
error is proposed concerning the charged particle density measured with the
surface arrays, which arises due to simplifications (namely, the superposition
approximation) in nucleus-nucleus interaction description applied to the shower
modeling. Making use of the essential correction factors results in congruous
CR energy spectra within experimental errors. Residual differences in the
energy scales of giant arrays can be attributed to the actual overall accuracy
of the EAS detection technique used. CR acceleration and propagation model

Within 6$^{\circ}$ of the Centre, we found 88 maser sites, of which more than
half (48) are new discoveries. The masers are confined to a narrow Galactic
latitude range, indicative of many sources at the Galactic Centre distance and
beyond, and confined to a thin disk population; there is no high latitude
population that might be ascribed to the Galactic Bulge.
  Within 2$^{\circ}$ of the Galactic Centre the maser velocities all lie
between -60 and +77 \kms, a range much smaller than the 540 \kms range observed
in CO. Elsewhere, the maser with highest positive velocity (+107 \kms) occurs,
surprisingly, near longitude 355$^{\circ}$ and is probably attributable to the
Galactic bar. The maser with the most negative velocity (-127 \kms) is near
longitude 346$^{\circ}$, within the longitude-velocity locus of the near side
of the `3-kpc arm'. It has the most extreme velocity of a clear population of
masers associated with the near and far sides of the 3-kpc arm. Closer to the
Galactic Centre the maser space density is generally low, except within 0.25
kpc of the Centre itself, the `Galactic Centre Zone', where it is 50 times
higher, which is hinted at by the longitude distribution, and confirmed by the
unusual velocities.

catalog including information on photometric redshifts (photo-z) and SED types

weak lensing tomography feasible with optical (and NIR) multi-band data. Since
most of useful cosmological information arises from the sample variance limited
regime for upcoming lensing surveys, a suitable subsample can be obtained by
discarding a large fraction of galaxies that have less reliable photo-z
estimations. We develop a method to efficiently identify photo-z outliers by
monitoring the width of posterior likelihood function of redshift estimation
for each galaxies. This clipping method may allow to obtain clean tomographic
redshift bins (here three bins considered) that have almost no overlaps between
different bins, by discarding more than 70% galaxies of ill-defined photo-z's
corresponding to the number densities of remaining galaxies less than 20 per
square arcminutes for a Subaru-type deep survey. Restricting the ranges of
magnitudes and redshifts and/or adding near infrared data help obtain a cleaner
redshift binning. By using the Fisher information matrix formalism, we
propagate photo-z errors into biases in the dark energy equation of state
parameter w. We found that, by discarding most of ill-defined photo-z galaxies,
the bias in w can be reduced to the level comparable to the marginalized
statistical error, however, the residual, small systematic bias remains due to
asymmetric scatters around the relation between photometric and true redshifts.
We also use the mock catalog to estimate the cumulative signal-to-noise (S/N)
ratios for measuring the angular cross-correlations of galaxies between finner
photo-z bins, finding the higher S/N values for photo-z bins including photo-z
outliers.

expected revenue of the seller, and is appropriate for risk-neutral sellers. In
this paper, we identify good mechanisms for risk-averse sellers. As is standard
in the economics literature, we model the risk-aversion of a seller by endowing
the seller with a monotone concave utility function. We then seek robust
mechanisms that are approximately optimal for all sellers, no matter what their
levels of risk-aversion are. We have two main results for multi-unit auctions
with unit-demand bidders whose valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a regular
distribution. First, we identify a posted-price mechanism called the Hedge
mechanism, which gives a universal constant factor approximation; we also show
for the unlimited supply case that this mechanism is in a sense the best
possible. Second, we show that the VCG mechanism gives a universal constant
factor approximation when the number of bidders is even only a small multiple
of the number of items. Along the way we point out that Myerson's
characterization of the optimal mechanisms fails to extend to
utility-maximization for risk-averse sellers, and establish interesting
properties of regular distributions and monotone hazard rate distributions.

Resulting from this, it is found that van der Waals cohesive forces between

with particle weights and be greater, in general, than electrostatic and solar
radiation pressure forces. Based on this scaling, we interpret previous
experiments performed on cohesive powders in the terrestrial environment as
being relevant for the understanding of processes on asteroid surfaces. The
implications of these terrestrial experiments for interpreting observations of

that differ from previously assumed processes for these environments. Based on

of magnetic permeability on frequency, we conclude that the impact of magnetic

the zero-frequency term in the Lifshitz formula. The computations of the

permittivity of metals is described using both the Drude and the plasma model
approaches. It is shown that the Casimir repulsion through the vacuum gap can
be realized in the configuration of a ferromagnetic dielectric plate near a

the respective analytical results in the asymptotic limit of large separations

equations which are often used to describe the vortex tubes observed in
numerical simulations of three-dimensional turbulence. In this model, the
velocity field is a two-dimensional perturbation of a linear straining flow
with axial symmetry. The only free parameter is the Reynolds number $Re =
\Gamma/\nu$, where $\Gamma$ is the total circulation of the vortex and $\nu$ is
the kinematic viscosity. The purpose of this paper is to show that Burgers
vortex is asymptotically stable with respect to general three-dimensional
perturbations, for all values of the Reynolds number. This definitive result
subsumes earlier studies by various authors, which were either restricted to
small Reynolds numbers or to two-dimensional perturbations. Our proof relies on
the crucial observation that the linearized operator at Burgers vortex has a
simple and very specific dependence upon the axial variable. This allows to
reduce the full linearized equations to a vectorial two-dimensional problem,
which can be treated using an extension of the techniques developped in earlier
works. Although Burgers vortices are found to be stable for all Reynolds
numbers, the proof indicates that perturbations may undergo an important
transient amplification if $Re$ is large, a phenomenon that was indeed observed
in numerical simulations.

analysis to the three-year sample of 56 SNe Ia over the range 0.2<z<1.8, using
a Markov chain Monte Carlo to determine the best-fit unimodal delay-time
distribution function. The test, which ultimately compares the star formation
rate density history to the unbinned volumetric SN Ia rate history from the
GOODS/HST-SN survey, reveals a SN Ia delay-time distribution that is tightly
confined to 3-4 Gyrs (to >95% confidence). This result is difficult to resolve
with any intrinsic delay-time distribution function (bimodal or otherwise), in
which a substantial fraction (e.g., >10%) of events are ``prompt'', requiring
less than approximately 1 Gyr to develop from formation to explosion. The
result is, however, strongly motivated by the decline in the number of SNe Ia
at z>1.2. Sub-samples of the HST-SN data confined to lower redshifts (z<1) show
plausible delay-time distributions that are dominated by prompt events, which
is more consistent with results from low-redshift supernova samples and
supernova host galaxy properties. Scenarios in which a substantial fraction of
z>1.2 supernovae are extraordinarily obscured by dust may partly explain the
differences in low-z and high-z results. Other possible resolutions may include
environmental dependencies (such as gas-phase metallicity) that affect the

temperature region, data of extensive numerical experiments are generally in
good agreement with the theoretical values of $\chi_{\rm SG}$ determined from
the Bethe tree. In the absence of external fields, the data also show a scaling
relation $\chi_{\rm SG}=N^{1/3}F(N^{1/3}|T-T_c|/T_c)$, which has been
conjectured in the literature, where $T_c$ is the critical temperature. In the
presence of external fields, on the other hand, the numerical data are not
consistent with this scaling relation. A numerical analysis of Hessian
eigenvalues implies that strong finite size corrections of the lower band edge
of the eigenvalue distribution, which seem relevant only in the presence of the
fields, are a major source of inconsistency. This may be related to the known
difficulty in using only numerical methods to detect the AT instability.

In a partially ionized plasma, the collisions with the neutrals modify the IA

increasing the neutral density, the mode becomes first evanescent and then
reappears for a still larger number of neutrals. A similar behavior is obtained

usually consider an extended molecule, which includes, in addition to the

remain confined within the molecule, and the extended molecule is sufficiently
large, the current can be expressed by means of Laudauer-type formulae.
Electron correlations are embodied into the retarded Green function of a
sufficiently large but isolated extended molecule, which represents the key
quantity that can be accurately determined by means of ab initio quantum
chemical calculations. To exemplify these ideas, we present and analyze
numerical results obtained within full CI calculations for an extended molecule
described by the interacting resonant level model. Based on them, we argue that
for organic electrodes the transport properties can be reliably computed,
because the extended molecule can be chosen sufficiently small to be tackled
within accurate ab initio methods. For metallic electrodes, larger extended
molecules have to be considered in general, but a (semi-)quantitative
description of the transport should still be possible particularly in the
typical cases where electron transport proceeds by off-resonant tunneling. Our
numerical results also demonstrate that, contrary to the usual claim, the ratio
between the characteristic Coulomb strength and the level width due to
molecule-electrode coupling is not the only quantity needed to assess whether
electron correlation effects are strong or weak.

additivity of GM of multipartite states with real and non-negative entries in
the computational basis. Many states of experimental and theoretical interests
have this property, e.g. Bell diagonal states, maximally correlated generalized
Bell diagonal states, generalized Dicke states, the Smolin state, and the
generalization of D\""{u}r's multipartite bound entangled states. We also prove
the additivity of other two measures for some of these examples. Second, we
show the non-additivity of GM of all antisymmetric states of three or more
parties, and provide a unified explanation of the non-additivity of the three
measures of the antisymmetric projector states. In particular, we derive
analytical formulae of the three measures of one copy and two copies of the
antisymmetric projector states respectively. Third, we show, with a statistical
approach, that almost all multipartite pure states with sufficiently large
number of parties are nearly maximally entangled with respect to GM and
relative entropy of entanglement. However, their GM is not strong additive;
what's more surprising, for generic pure states with real entries in the
computational basis, GM of one copy and two copies, respectively, are almost
equal. Hence, more states may be suitable for universal quantum computation, if
measurements can be performed on two copies of the resource states. We also
show that almost all multipartite pure states cannot be produced reversibly

including interactions between these degenerate states was argued to lead to a
large ground state spin with potential spintronics applications. Here we
perform a systematic fRG flow where the excited single-particle states are
integrated out with a decreasing energy cutoff, yielding a renormalized
low-energy Hamiltonian for the zero-energy states that includes effects of the

with a simpler Hartree-Fock treatment of the interaction effects within the
zero-energy states only. In particular, for trigonal nanodiscs the degeneracy
of the one-particle-states with zero-energy turns out to be very robust against
influences of the higher levels. As an explanation, we give a general argument

large-scale study of the morphologies of SMGs in the near-infrared at ~0.1""
resolution (<1kpc). We find that the half light radii of the SMGs
(r_h=2.3+/-0.3 and 2.8+/-0.4kpc in the observed I- and H-bands respectively)
and asymmetries are not statistically distinct from the comparison sample of
star-forming galaxies. However, we demonstrate that the SMG morphologies differ
more between the rest-frame UV and optical-bands than typical star-forming
galaxies and interpret this as evidence for structured dust obscuration. We
show that the composite observed H-band light profile of SMGs is better fit
with a Sersic index with n~2, suggesting the stellar structure of SMGs is best
described by a spheroid/elliptical galaxy light distribution. We also compare
the sizes and stellar masses of SMGs to local and high-redshift populations,
and find that the SMGs have stellar densities which are comparable to local
early-type galaxies, as well as luminous, red and dense galaxies at z~1.5 which
have been proposed as direct SMG descendants, although the SMG stellar masses
and sizes are systematically larger. Overall, our results suggest that the
physical processes occuring within the galaxies are too complex to be simply
characterised by the rest-frame UV/optical morphologies which appear to be
essentially decoupled from all other observables, such as bolometric
luminosity, stellar or dynamical mass.

investigate the possibility that solid particles are trapped at local pressure
maxima in the dynamically evolving disk. We perform the first 3-D global
non-ideal MHD calculations of the disk treating the turbulence driven by the
magneto-rotational instability. The domain contains an inner MRI-active region
near the young star and an outer midplane dead zone, with the transition
between the two modeled by a sharp increase in the magnetic diffusivity. The
azimuthal magnetic fields generated in the active zone oscillate over time,
changing sign about every 150 years. We thus observe the radial structure of
the `butterfly pattern' seen previously in local shearing-box simulations. The
mean magnetic field diffuses from the active zone into the dead zone, where the
Reynolds stress nevertheless dominates. The greater total accretion stress in
the active zone leads to a net reduction in the surface density, so that after
800 years an approximate steady state is reached in which a local radial
maximum in the midplane pressure lies near the transition radius. We also
observe the formation of density ridges within the active zone. The dead zone
in our models possesses a mean magnetic field, significant Reynolds stresses
and a steady local pressure maximum at the inner edge, where the outward
migration of planetary embryos and the efficient trapping of solid material are
possible.

to incorporate the volatility of the users biometric features into the

incorporate multiple biometric modalities into cryptographic key generation so
as to provide better security. In this article, we propose an efficient
approach based on multimodal biometrics (Iris and fingerprint) for generation
of secure cryptographic key. The proposed approach is composed of three modules
namely, 1) Feature extraction, 2) Multimodal biometric template generation and
3) Cryptographic key generation. Initially, the features, minutiae points and
texture properties are extracted from the fingerprint and iris images
respectively. Subsequently, the extracted features are fused together at the
feature level to construct the multibiometric template. Finally, a 256bit
secure cryptographic key is generated from the multibiometric template. For
experimentation, we have employed the fingerprint images obtained from publicly
available sources and the iris images from CASIA Iris Database. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

  treatment of complementarity is relegated to future work",,,,"quant-ph math.CT math.QA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While multipartite quantum states constitute a (if not the) key resource for
quantum computations and protocols, obtaining a high-level, structural
understanding of entanglement involving arbitrarily many qubits is a
long-standing open problem in quantum computer science. In this paper we expose
the algebraic and graphical structure of the GHZ-state and the W-state, as well
as a purely graphical distinction that characterises the behaviours of these
states. In turn, this structure yields a compositional graphical model for
expressing general multipartite states.
  We identify those states, named Frobenius states, which canonically induce an
algebraic structure, namely the structure of a commutative Frobenius algebra
(CFA). We show that all SLOCC-maximal tripartite qubit states are locally
equivalent to Frobenius states. Those that are SLOCC-equivalent to the
GHZ-state induce special commutative Frobenius algebras, while those that are
SLOCC-equivalent to the W-state induce what we call anti-special commutative
Frobenius algebras. From the SLOCC-classification of tripartite qubit states
follows a representation theorem for two dimensional CFAs.
  Together, a GHZ and a W Frobenius state form the primitives of a graphical
calculus. This calculus is expressive enough to generate and reason about
arbitrary multipartite states, which are obtained by ""composing"" the GHZ- and
W-states, giving rise to a rich graphical paradigm for general multipartite
entanglement.

We consider pseudoscalar, vector and scalar meson fields interacting with 1/2
spin fermion ones via the Yukawa-type couplings to introduce trial interactions
between ""bare"" particles. The subsequent unitary clothing transformations are
found to express the total Hamiltonian through new interaction operators that
refer to particles with physical (observable) properties, the so-called clothed

energy-independent operators for the clothed nucleons, being built up in the
second order in the coupling constants. The corresponding analytic expressions
in momentum space are compared with the separate meson contributions to the
one-boson-exchange potentials in the meson theory of nuclear forces. In order
to evaluate the T-matrix of the N-N scattering we have used an equivalence
theorem that enables us to operate in the clothed particle representation (CPR)
instead of the bare particle representation with its huge amount of virtual
processes. We have derived the Lippmann-Schwinger-type equation for the CPR

As expected from the Landau approach, ab initio calculations show that a
non-zero ferroelectric polarization P along the y direction is induced by the
peculiar antiferromagnetic configuration of Mn spins occurring in Cu2MnSnS4.
The comparison between P, calculated either via density-functional-theory or
according to Landau approach, clearly shows that ferroelectricity is mainly
driven by Heisenberg-exchange terms and only to a minor extent by relativistic
terms. At variance with previous examples of collinear antiferromagnets with
magnetically-induced ferroelectricity (such as AFM-E HoMnO3), the ionic
displacements occurring upon magnetic ordering are very small, so that the
exchange-striction mechanism (i.e. displacement of ions so as to minimize the
magnetic coupling energy) is not effective here. Rather, the microscopic
mechanism at the basis of polarization has mostly an electronic origin. In this
framework, we propose the small magnetic moment at Cu sites induced by
neighboring Mn magnetic moments to play a relevant role in inducing P. Finally,
we investigate the effect of the anion by comparing Cu2MnSnSe4 and Cu2MnSnS4:
Se-4p states, more delocalized compared to S-3p states, are able to better
mediate the Mn-Mn interaction, in turn leading to a higher ferroelectric
polarization in the Se-based compound.

Kbar nuclear systems are formed by this ""super-strong"" nuclear force due to
migrating real bosons, Kbar, a la Heitler-London-Heisenberg, which
overcompensates the stiff nuclear incompressibility. Theoretical background of
the Lambda (1405) ansatz is discussed in connection with the double-pole
picture of Lambda (1405) based on chiral SU(3) dynamics. Detailed analysis
reveals single-pole nature of the observable Lambda (1405). There are two kinds
of Sigma pi invariant masses experimentally observable, the usual T22 invariant
mass and the conversion T21 invariant mass. It is of vital importance to
determine whether the Lambda* mass is 1405 MeV or 1420 MeV. The T21 invariant
mass from K- absorption at rest in deuteron can provide decisive information
about this Lambda* mass problem.

most essential for the intended Higgs boson mass determination. These are the
complex Higgs doublet as well as the top and bottom quark fields and their

Spitzer/IRAC photometry of the surroundings. RCW 34 consists of three different
regions. A large bubble has been detected on the IRAC images in which a cluster
of intermediate- and low-mass class II objects is found. At the northern edge
of this bubble, an HII region is located, ionized by 3 OB stars. Intermediate
mass stars (2 - 3 Msun) are detected of G- and K- spectral type. These stars
are still in the pre-main sequence (PMS) phase. North of the HII region, a
photon-dominated region is present, marking the edge of a dense molecular cloud
traced by H2 emission. Several class 0/I objects are associated with this
cloud, indicating that star formation is still taking place. The distance to
RCW 34 is revised to 2.5 +- 0.2 kpc and an age estimate of 2 - 1 Myrs is
derived from the properties of the PMS stars inside the HII region. The most
likely scenario for the formation of the three regions is that star formation
propagates from South to North. First the bubble is formed, produced by
intermediate- and low-mass stars only, after that, the HII region is formed
from a dense core at the edge of the molecular cloud, resulting in the
expansion as a champagne flow. More recently, star formation occurred in the
rest of the molecular cloud. Two different formation scenarios are possible:
(a) The bubble with the cluster of low- and intermediate mass stars triggered
the formation of the O star at the edge of the molecular cloud which in turn
induces the current star-formation in the molecular cloud. (b) An external
triggering is responsible for the star-formation propagating from South to
North. [abridged]

especially the focal ratio degradation (FRD) which places constraints on the
performance of fibre-fed spectrographs used for multiplexed spectroscopy. To
this end we present a modified version of the FRD model proposed by Carrasco
and Parry \cite{Carrasco1994} to quantify the the number of scattering defects
within an optical fibre using a single parameter. The model predicts many
trends which are seen experimentally, for example, a decrease in FRD as core
diameter increases, and also as wavelength increases. However the model also
predicts a strong dependence on FRD with length that is not seen
experimentally. By adapting the single fibre model to include a second fibre,
we can quantify the amount of FRD due to stress caused by the method of
termination. By fitting the model to experimental data we find that polishing
the fibre causes more stress to be induced in the end of the fibre compared to
a simple cleave technique. We estimate that the number of scattering defects
caused by polishing is approximately double that produced by cleaving. By
placing limits on the end-effect, the model can be used to estimate the
residual-length dependence in very long fibres, such as those required for
Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), without having to carry out costly
experiments. We also use our data to compare different methods of fibre
termination.

classic notions belonging to the heart of lambda-calculus and logic. We start
with an exploration of the structure of fixed point combinators (fpc's), vastly
generalizing the well-known fact that if Y is an fpc, Y(SI) is again an fpc,
generating the Boehm sequence of fpc's. Using the infinitary lambda-calculus we
devise infinitely many other generation schemes for fpc's. In this way we find
schemes and building blocks to construct new fpc's in a modular way.
  Having created a plethora of new fixed point combinators, the task is to
prove that they are indeed new. That is, we have to prove their
beta-inconvertibility. Known techniques via Boehm Trees do not apply, because
all fpc's have the same Boehm Tree (BT). Therefore, we employ `clocked BT's',
with annotations that convey information of the tempo in which the data in the
BT are produced. BT's are thus enriched with an intrinsic clock behaviour,
leading to a refined discrimination method for lambda-terms. The corresponding
equality is strictly intermediate between beta-convertibility and BT-equality,
the equality in the classical models of lambda-calculus. An analogous approach
pertains to Levy-Longo Berarducci trees. Finally, we increase the
discrimination power by a precision of the clock notion that we call `atomic
clock'.
