as a function of carrier concentration, magnetic field, and temperature, and
highlight its connection to numerous recent experiments. The phase diagram is
then used as a point of departure for a pedagogical review of various quantum
phases and phase transitions of insulators, superconductors, and metals. The
bond operator method is used to describe the transition of dimerized
antiferromagnetic insulators between magnetically ordered states and spin-gap
states. The Schwinger boson method is applied to frustrated square lattice
antiferromagnets: phase diagrams containing collinear and spirally ordered
magnetic states, Z_2 spin liquids, and valence bond solids are presented, and
described by an effective gauge theory of spinons. Insights from these theories
of insulators are then applied to a variety of symmetry breaking transitions in
d-wave superconductors. The latter systems also contain fermionic
quasiparticles with a massless Dirac spectrum, and their influence on the order
parameter fluctuations and quantum criticality is carefully discussed. I
conclude with an introduction to strong coupling problems associated with
symmetry breaking transitions in two-dimensional metals, where the order
parameter fluctuations couple to a gapless line of fermionic excitations along
the Fermi surface.

multi-cut matrix models with polynomial potentials. In the case of the cubic
matrix model, we give explicit expressions for the ring of non-holomorphic
modular objects that are needed to express all closed matrix model amplitudes.
This allows us to integrate the holomorphic anomaly equation up to holomorphic
modular terms that we fix by the gap condition up to genus four. There is an
one-dimensional submanifold of the moduli space in which the spectral curve
becomes the Seiberg--Witten curve and the ring reduces to the non-holomorphic
modular ring of the group $\Gamma(2)$. On that submanifold, the gap conditions
completely fix the holomorphic ambiguity and the model can be solved explicitly
to very high genus. We use these results to make precision tests of the
connection between the large order behavior of the 1/N expansion and
non-perturbative effects due to instantons. Finally, we argue that a full
understanding of the large genus asymptotics in the multi-cut case requires a
new class of non-perturbative sectors in the matrix model.

such as the internet. Modern information theory is generally considered to have
been founded in 1948 by Shannon in his seminal paper, ""A mathematical theory of

success with communications engineers. Shannon defined mathematically the
amount of information transmitted over a channel. The amount of information
doesn't mean the number of symbols of data. It depends on occurrence
probabilities of symbols of the data. Meanwhile, psychophysics is the study of
quantitative relations between psychological events and physical events or,
more specifically, between sensations and the stimuli that produce them. It
seems that Shannon's information theory bears no relation to psychophysics
established by German scientist and philosopher Fechner. Here I show that to
our astonishment it is possible to combine two fields. And therefore we come to
be capable of measuring mathematically perceptions of the physical stimuli
applicable to the Weber-Fechner law. I will define the concept of new entropy.
And as a consequence of this, new field will begin life.

transparency consisting of two spin-singlet superconducting leads connected via
a single classical spin precessing at the frequency $\Omega$. The presence of
the spin in the junction provides different transmission amplitudes for spin-up
and spin-down quasiparticles as well as a time-dependent spin-flip transmission
term. For a phase biased junction, we show that a steady-state superconducting
charge current flows through the junction and that an out-of-equilibrium
circularly polarized spin current, of frequency $\Omega$, is emitted in the
leads. Detailed understanding of the charge and spin currents is obtained in
the entire parameter range. In the adiabatic regime, $\hbar \Omega \ll 2\Delta$
where $\Delta$ is the superconducting gap, and for high transparencies of the
junction, a strong suppression of the current takes place around $\vp \approx
0$ due to an abrupt change in the occupation of the Andreev bound-states. At
higher values of the phase and/or precession frequency, extended
(quasi-particle like) states compete with the bound-states in order to carry
the current. Well below the superconducting transition, these results are shown
to be weakly affected by the back-action of the spin current on the dynamics of
the precessing spin. Indeed, we show that the Gilbert damping due to the
quasi-particle spin current is strongly suppressed at low-temperatures, which
goes along with a shift of the precession frequency due to the condensate. The
results obtained may be of interest for on-going experiments in the field of
molecular spintronics.

formed by gravitational collapse into almost-flat space-time and weak radiation
at a late time. We evaluate quantum amplitudes (not just probabilities) for
transitions from initial to final states, and show that no information is lost
in collapse to a black hole. Boundary data for the gravitational field and a
scalar field are posed on an initial space-like hypersurface $\Sigma_I$ and a
final surface $\Sigma_F$. These asymptotically-flat 3-surfaces are separated by
a Lorentzian proper-time interval $T$, measured at spatial infinity. The
boundary-value problem is made well-posed, classically and
quantum-mechanically, by rotating $T$ into the lower-half complex plane: $T\to
{\mid}T{\mid}\exp(-i\theta), 0<\theta\leq\pi/2$. This corresponds to Feynman's
$+i\epsilon$ prescription. For the classical boundary-value problem, we
calculate the second-variation classical Lorentzian action $S^{(2)}_{class}$ as
a functional of the boundary data. Following Feynman, the Lorentzian quantum
amplitude is recovered in the limit $\theta\to 0_{+}$ from the well-defined
complex-$T$ amplitude. Dirac's canonical approach to the quantisation of
constrained systems shows that for locally-supersymmetric theories of gravity
the amplitude is exactly semi-classical: $\exp(i S^{(2)}_{class})$ for weak
perturbations, apart from delta-functionals of the supersymmetry constraints.
We treat such quantum amplitudes for weak scalar-field configurations on
$\Sigma_F$, taking the weak final gravitational field to be spherically
symmetric. The treatment involves adiabatic solutions of the scalar wave
equation. This extends our previous work, giving explicit expressions for the
real and imaginary parts of such quantum amplitudes.

The watermarked image is then compressed and sent on the network. When the

watermarking the image increases the size of the uncompressed image but that

from computational point of view. In this paper we introduced a new clustering
based approach, which divides the stream in chunks and clusters each chunk
using kmedian into variable number of clusters. Instead of storing complete
data stream chunk in memory, we replace it with the weighted medians found
after mining a data stream chunk and pass that information along with the newly
arrived data chunk to the next phase. The weighted medians found in each phase
are tested for outlierness and after a given number of phases, it is either
declared as a real outlier or an inlier. Our technique is theoretically better
than the k-means as it does not fix the number of clusters to k rather gives a
range to it and provides a more stable and better solution which runs in
poly-logarithmic space.

respect to the magnetic field. These anisotropies trigger plasma instabilities
at scales just above the ion Larmor radius \rho_i and much below the mean free
path \lambda_{mfp}. They have growth rates of a fraction of the ion cyclotron
frequency - much faster than either the global dynamics or local turbulence.
The instabilities dramatically modify the transport properties and, therefore,
the macroscopic dynamics of the plasma. Their nonlinear evolution drives
pressure anisotropies towards marginal stability, controlled by the plasma beta
\beta_i. Here this nonlinear evolution is worked out for the simplest
analytically tractable example - the parallel firehose instability. In the
nonlinear regime, both analytical theory and the numerical solution predict
secular growth of magnetic fluctuations. They develop a k^{-3} spectrum,
extending from scales somewhat larger than \rho_i to the maximum scale that
grows secularly with time (~t^{1/2}); the relative pressure anisotropy
(\pperp-\ppar)/\ppar tends to the marginal value -2/\beta_i. The marginal state
is achieved via changes in the magnetic field, not particle scattering. When a
parallel ion heat flux is present, the firehose mutates into the new
gyrothermal instability (GTI), which continues to exist up to firehose-stable
values of pressure anisotropy, which can be positive and are limited by the
heat flux. The nonlinear evolution of the GTI also features secular growth of
magnetic fluctuations, but the spectrum is eventually dominated by modes around
the scale ~\rho_i l_T/\lambda_{mfp}, where l_T is the scale of the parallel
temperature variation. Implications for momentum and heat transport are
speculated about. This study is motivated by the dynamics of galaxy cluster

causality. It describes the conditional independences among the observations

In the conventional setting, the observations are random variables and the
independence is a statistical one, i.e., the information content of
observations is measured in terms of Shannon entropy. We formulate a
generalized CMC for any kind of observations on which independence is defined
via an arbitrary submodular information measure. Recently, this has been
discussed for observations in terms of binary strings where information is
understood in the sense of Kolmogorov complexity. Our approach enables us to
find computable alternatives to Kolmogorov complexity, e.g., the length of a
text after applying existing data compression schemes. We show that our CMC is
justified if one restricts the attention to a class of causal mechanisms that
is adapted to the respective information measure. Our justification is similar
to deriving the statistical CMC from functional models of causality, where
every variable is a deterministic function of its observed causes and an
unobserved noise term.

8P/Tuttle (8P). 17P was observed for 30 ksec right after its major outburst, on
31 Oct 2007 (10:07 UT) and comet 8P/Tuttle was observed in 2008 January for 47
ksec. During the two Chandra observations, 17P was producing at least 100 times
more water than 8P but was 2.2 times further away from the Sun. Also, 17P is
the first comet observed at high latitude (+19.1 degrees) during solar minimum,
while 8P was observed at a lower solar latitude (3.4 degrees). The X-ray
spectrum of 17P is unusually soft with little significant emission at energies
above 500 eV. Depending on our choice of background, we derive a 300 to 1000 eV
flux of 0.5 to 4.5 x 10^-13 ergs/cm2/sec, with over 90% of the emission in the
300 to 400 eV range. This corresponds to an X-ray luminosity between 0.4 to 3.3
x 10^15 ergs/sec. 17P's lack of X-rays in the 400 to 1000 eV range, in a simple
picture, may be attributed to the polar solar wind, which is depleted in highly
charged ions. 8P/Tuttle was much brighter, with an average count rate of 0.20
counts/s in the 300 to 1000 eV range. We derive an average X-ray flux in this
range of 9.4 x 10^-13 ergs/cm2/sec and an X-ray luminosity for the comet of 1.7
x 10^14 ergs/sec. The light curve showed a dramatic decrease in flux of over
60% between observations on January 1st and 4th. When comparing outer regions
of the coma to inner regions, its spectra showed a decrease in ratios of
CVI/CV, OVIII/OVII, as predicted by recent solar wind charge exchange emission
models. There are remarkable differences between the X-ray emission from these
two comets, further demonstrating the qualities of cometary X-ray observations,
and solar wind charge exchange emission in more general as a means of remote

electromagnetic vacuum of a complex medium made of point electric dipoles. To
this aim, we apply the linear response theory to the computation of the
polarization field propagator and study the spectrum of vacuum fluctuations.
The physical distinction among the local density of states which enter the
spectra of light propagation, total dipole emission, coherent emission, total
vacuum energy and Schwinger-bulk energy is made clear. Analytical expressions
for the spectrum of dipole emission and for the vacuum energy are derived.
Their respective relations with the spectrum of external light and with the
Schwinger-bulk energy are found. The light spectrum and the Schwinger-bulk
energy are determined by the Dyson propagator. The emission spectrum and the
total vacuum energy are determined by the polarization propagator. An exact
relationship of proportionality between both propagators is found in terms of
local field factors. A study of the nature of stimulated emission from a single
dipole is carried out. Regarding coherent emission, it contains two components.
A direct one which is transferred radiatively and directly from the emitter
into the medium and whose spectrum is that of external light. And an indirect
one which is radiated by induced dipoles. The induction is mediated by one (and
only one) local field factor. Regarding the vacuum energy, we find that in
addition to the Schwinger-bulk energy the vacuum energy of an effective medium
contains local field contributions proportional to the resonant frequency and
to the spectral line-width.

telescope to explore the high energy gamma-ray universe. The instrument covers
the energy range from 20 MeV to 300 GeV with greatly improved sensitivity and
ability to localize gamma-ray point sources. It detects gamma-rays through
conversion to electron-positron pairs and measurement of their direction in a
tracker and their energy in a calorimeter.
  This thesis presents the gamma-ray light curves and the phase-resolved
spectral measurements of radio-loud gamma-ray pulsars detected by the LAT. The
measurement of pulsar spectral parameters (i.e. integrated flux, spectral
index, and energy cut-off) depends on the instrument response functions (IRFs).
A method developed for the on-orbit validation of the effective area is
presented using the Vela pulsar. The cut efficiencies between the real data and
the simulated data are compared at each stage of the background rejection. The
results are then propagated to the IRFs, allowing the systematic uncertainties
of the spectral parameters to be estimated.
  The last part of this thesis presents the discoveries, using both the LAT
observations and the radio and X ephemeredes, of new individual gamma-ray
pulsars such as PSR J0205+6449, and the Vela-like pulsars J2229+6114 and

the gamma-ray emission model. In addition, we discuss the properties of a large

detected in the WMAP data by Vielva et al. 2004, is that it arises from the
interaction of the CMB radiation with a cosmic texture (Cruz et al. 2007b). In
this case, a lack of polarization is expected in the region of the spot, as
compared to the typical values associated to large fluctuations of a GIRF. In
addition, other physical processes related to a non-linear evolution of the
gravitational field could lead to a similar scenario. However, some of these
alternative scenarios (e.g., a large void in the large scale structure) have
been shown to be very unlikely. In this work we characterise the polarization
properties of the Cold Spot under both hypotheses: a large Gaussian spot and an
anomalous feature generated, for instance, by a cosmic texture. We propose a
methodology to distinguish between them, and we discuss its discrimination
power as a function of the instrumental noise level. In particular, we address
the cases of current experiments, like WMAP and Planck, and others in
development as QUIJOTE. We find that for an ideal experiment the Gaussian
hypothesis could be rejected at a significance level better than 0.8%. While
WMAP is far from providing useful information in this respect, we find that
Planck will be able to reach a significance of around 7%; in addition, we show
that the ground-based experiment QUIJOTE could provide a significance of around
1%. If these results are combined with the significance level found for the CS
in temperature, the capability of QUIJOTE and Planck to reject the alternative
hypothesis becomes 0.025% and 0.124%, respectively.

X-ray energies (0.2 - 10 keV) PKS 0208-512 is significantly detected by
Swift/XRT, showing a power-law spectrum with a photon index of ~ 1.64. Its
X-ray luminosity varied by roughly 30% during one month. At hard X-/soft

$H_{c2}$, with which we can treat the Pauli and the orbital depairing effect on
an equal footing. The strong coupling effect for general electronic structures
is also taken into account. We show that the experimentally observed features
in $H_{c2}\parallel \hat{z}$, the huge value up to 30(T), the downward
curvatures, and the strong pressure dependence, are naturally understood as an
interplay of the Rashba spin-orbit interaction due to the lack of inversion
symmetry and the spin fluctuations near the QCP. The large anisotropy between
$H_{c2}\parallel \hat{z}$ and $H_{c2}\perp \hat{z}$ is explained in terms of
the spin-orbit interaction. Furthermore, a possible realization of the
Fulde-Ferrell- Larkin-Ovchinnikov state for $H\perp \hat{z}$ is studied. We
also examine effects of spin-flip scattering processes in the pairing
interaction and those of the applied magnetic field on the spin fluctuations.
We find that the above mentioned results are robust against these effects. The

method from gravity side along, which will provide a clue to a better
understanding on the gauge/gravity duality. At last, we study the fluctuation
of the force, and we find the fluctuation acting on the point-like particle can
never be larger than the expectation value of the force. For black hole in AdS
space, by gauge/gravity duality, the fluctuation is induced by thermal
fluctuation from field theory living on conformal boundary. And for the metric
of black hole in flat space, the ratio between fluctuation and force goes to a
constant$\frac{T}{m}$ at infinity. .

to English like Roman script, one of the major stumbling blocks in Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) of handwritten Bangla script is the large number of
complex shaped character classes of Bangla alphabet. In addition to 50 basic
character classes, there are nearly 160 complex shaped compound character
classes in Bangla alphabet. Dealing with such a large varieties of handwritten
characters with a suitably designed feature set is a challenging problem.
Uncertainty and imprecision are inherent in handwritten script. Moreover, such
a large varieties of complex shaped characters, some of which have close
resemblance, makes the problem of OCR of handwritten Bangla characters more
difficult. Considering the complexity of the problem, the present approach
makes an attempt to identify compound character classes from most frequently to
less frequently occurred ones, i.e., in order of importance. This is to develop
a frame work for incrementally increasing the number of learned classes of
compound characters from more frequently occurred ones to less frequently
occurred ones along with Basic characters. On experimentation, the technique is
observed produce an average recognition rate of 79.25 after three fold cross

intracellular communication. We show that Continuous Stochastic Logic
properties can both detect and distinguish the types of cross-talk. The

one of their advantages as a modelling technique. It is certainly true that in
biochemical systems, as in many other systems, model construction is made
easier in a formalism which allows the problem to be tackled compositionally.
In this paper we consider the extent to which the compositional structure which
is inherent in process algebra models of biochemical systems can be exploited
during model solution. In essence this means using the compositional structure
to guide decomposed solution and analysis.
  Unfortunately the dynamic behaviour of biochemical systems exhibits strong
interdependencies between the components of the model making decomposed
solution a difficult task. Nevertheless we believe that if such decomposition
based on process algebras could be established it would demonstrate substantial
benefits for systems biology modelling. In this paper we present our
preliminary investigations based on a case study of the pheromone pathway in
yeast, modelling in the stochastic process algebra Bio-PEPA.

estimate the rate of diffusional association, e.g. to be later used in
mesoscopic simulations. Meanwhile a portfolio of diffusional association (DA)
methods have been developed that exploit BD.
  However, DA methods do not clearly distinguish between modeling, simulation,

methods with respect to, for instance model assumptions, simulation
approximations or specific optimization strategies for steering the computation
of trajectories.
  To address this deficiency we propose FADA (Flexible Architecture for
Diffusional Association) - an architecture that allows the flexible definition
of the experiment comprising a formal description of the model in SpacePi,
different simulators, as well as validation and analysis methods. Based on the
NAM (Northrup-Allison-McCammon) method, which forms the basis of many existing

of future validation experiments illuminates how the FADA can be exploited in
order to estimate reaction rates and how validation techniques may be applied
to validate additional features of the model.

reproduce the conditions of many Martian locations near the surface trough

make contact with the known experimental results for iron atoms on the
CuN/Cu(100) surface [Hirjibehedin et al., Science {\bf 317}, 1199 (2007)], we
calculated the spectral functions in the presence of an external magnetic field
of varying strength applied along all three spatial directions. It is possible
to establish an upper bound on the coupling constant J: in the range of the
magnetic fields for which the experimental results are currently known (up to
7T), the low-energy features in the calculated spectra agree well with the
measured dI/dV spectra if the exchange coupling constant J is at most half as
large as that for cobalt atoms on the same surface. We show that for even
higher magnetic field (between 8 and 9T) applied along the ``hollow

as the area per lipid, the monolayer overlap, the nematic order, and pressure
profiles. Both the low-temperature regime, where the membranes are in a gel
phase, and the high-temperature regime, where they are in the fluid phase, are
considered. In the gel state, the membrane is hardly influenced by tension. In
the fluid state, high tensions lead to structural changes in the membrane,
which result in different compressibility regimes. The ripple state, which is
found at tension zero in the transition regime between the fluid and the gel
phase, disappears under tension and gives way to an interdigitated phase. We
also study the membrane fluctuations in the fluid phase. In the low tension
regime the data can be fitted nicely to a suitably extended elastic theory. At
higher tensions the elastic fit consistently underestimates the strength of
long-wavelength fluctuations. Finally, we investigate the influence of tension
on the effective interaction between simple transmembrane inclusions and show
that tension can be used to tune the hydrophobic mismatch interaction between
membrane proteins.

the SUSY-breaking model in the conformal window, and study the dynamics for the

charged under both $SU(N_C)$ and the standard model gauge group, and our model
can be regarded as a semi-direct gauge mediation model. The color number $N_C$
can be small to avoid the Landau pole problem, and the R symmetry is also
broken under a reasonable assumption on the strong dynamics of the model. The
model possesses only one free parameter, and the gaugino and sfermion masses
are naturally of the same order.

set function) with respect to a ""volume"" (a positive distributive set
function), proves its continuity (whenever the strict derivative exists) and
shows the validity of the mass-density paradigm: ""mass"" is recovered from
""density"" by integration with respect to ""volume"". It is remarkable that
Peano's strict derivative provides a consistent mathematical ground to the
concept of ""infinitesimal ratio"" between two magnitudes, successfully used
since Kepler. In this way the classical (i.e., pre-Lebesgue) measure theory
reaches a complete and definitive form in Peano's Applicazioni geometriche.
  A primary aim of the present paper is a detailed exposition of Peano's work
of 1887 leading to the concept of strict derivative of distributive set
functions and their use. Moreover, we compare Peano's work and Lebesgue's ""La
mesure des grandeurs"" (1935): in this memoir Lebesgue, motivated by coexistent
magnitudes of Cauchy, introduces a uniform-derivative of certain additive set
functions, a concept that coincides with Peano's strict derivative. Intriguing
questions are whether Lebesgue was aware of the contributions of Peano and
which role is played by the notions of strict derivative or of
uniform-derivative in today mathematical practice.

observed that both the models show a mass ordering of $v_2$ at low $p_{T}$ and
a switch over resulting a baryon-meson crossing at intermediate $p_{T}$. AMPT
generates higher $v_2$ values compared to UrQMD. In addition, constituent quark

behavior in terms of the transverse momentum $p_T$ is found to absent for both

respect to transverse kinetic energy $KE_T$. But default AMPT, where partonic

galaxies at all epochs. It has been posited that dust in the early Universe
must be different from dust at lower z. To date two reports directly support
this contention, one of which is based on the spectral shape of GRB 050904 at z
= 6.295. Aims: We reinvestigate the afterglow to understand dust at high z. We
address the claimed evidence for unusual (SN-origin) dust in its host galaxy by
simultaneously examining the X-ray and optical/NIR spectrophotometric data.
Methods: We derive the intrinsic SED of the afterglow at 0.47, 1.25 and 3.4
days, by re-reducing the Swift X-ray data, the 1.25 days FORS2 z-Gunn
photometric data, the spectroscopic and z'-band photometric data at ~3 days
from the Subaru telescope, as well as the critical UKIRT Z-band photometry at
0.47 days, upon which the claim of dust detection largely relies. Results: We
find no evidence of dust extinction in the SED. We compute flux densities at
lambda_rest = 1250 AA directly from the observed counts at all epochs. In the
earliest epoch, 0.47 days, the Z-band suppression is found to be smaller (0.3
+- 0.2 mag) than previously reported and statistically insignificant (<1.5
sigma). Furthermore we find that the photometry of this band is unstable and
difficult to calibrate. Conclusions: From the afterglow SED we demonstrate that
there is no evidence for dust extinction -- the SED at all times can be
reproduced without dust, and at 1.25 days in particular, significant extinction
can be excluded, with A(3000 AA) < 0.27 mag at 95% confidence using the SN-type
extinction curve. We conclude that there is no evidence of any extinction in
the afterglow of GRB 050904 and that the presence of SN-origin dust in the host

Special emphasis is paid to the quasicommutator ideal of the algebra generated
by the finite sections sequences and to the stability of sequences in that
algebra. For both problems, the sequence of the discrete boundaries plays an
essential role. Finally, for commutative groups and for free non-commutative

  Giuseppe Peano (1858-1932)",,,,"math.HO math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper a construction of affine exterior algebra of Grassmann, with a
special attention to the revisitation of this subject operated by Peano and his
School, is examined from a historical viewpoint. Even if the exterior algebra
over a vector space is a well known concept, the construction of an exterior
algebra over an affine space, in which points and vectors coexist, has been
neglected. This paper wants to fill this lack.
  Some attention is given to the introduction of defining by abstraction (today
called definition by quotienting or by equivalence relation), a procedure due
to and used by Peano to define geometric forms, basic elements of an affine
exterior algebra. This Peano's innovative way of defining, is a relevant
contribution to mathematics.
  It is observed that in the construction of an affine exterior algebra on the
Euclidean three-dimensional space, Grassmann and Peano make use of metric
concepts: an accurate analysis shows that, in some cases, the metric aspects
can be eliminated, putting into evidence the sufficiency of the underlying
affine structure of the Euclidean space.
  In the final part of the paper some geometrical and mechanical applications
and interpretations of the affine exterior algebra given by Grassmann and Peano
are presented.

emittances, energy spread, dispersions, betatron functions and etc. All these

to analytical and numerical investigations. The modeling framework can be

injected perpendicular to the sample plane in a localized part of a nanowire.
Depending on the geometrical and physical characteristic of the system, we
identify two different dynamical regimes (auto-oscillations) when an
out-of-plane external field is applied. The first regime is characterized by
nucleation of domain walls (DWs) below the current injection site and the
propagation of those up to the end of the nanowire, we also found an
oscillation frequency larger than 5GHz with a linear dependence on the applied
current density. This simple system can be used as a tuneable steady-state
domain wall oscillator. In the second dynamical regime, we observe the
nucleation of two DWs which propagate back and forth in the nanowire with a
sub-GHz oscillation frequency. The micromagnetic spectral mapping technique
shows the spatial distribution of the output power is localized symmetrically
in the nanowire. We suggest that this configuration can be used as
micromagnetic transformer to decouple electrically two different circuits.

can be a challenging task. The reason is that the construction of latent
components from the predictor variables also depends on the response variable.
While this typically leads to good performance and interpretable models in
practice, it makes the statistical analysis more involved. In this work, we
study the intrinsic complexity of Partial Least Squares Regression. Our
contribution is an unbiased estimate of its Degrees of Freedom. It is defined
as the trace of the first derivative of the fitted values, seen as a function
of the response. We establish two equivalent representations that rely on the
close connection of Partial Least Squares to matrix decompositions and Krylov
subspace techniques. We show that the Degrees of Freedom depend on the
collinearity of the predictor variables: The lower the collinearity is, the
higher the Degrees of Freedom are. In particular, they are typically higher
than the naive approach that defines the Degrees of Freedom as the number of
components. Further, we illustrate how the Degrees of Freedom approach can be
used for the comparison of different regression methods. In the experimental
section, we show that our Degrees of Freedom estimate in combination with
information criteria is useful for model selection.

equilibrium, and a stellar component. Cooling of the hot tenuous gas phase
feeds the cold gas phase. Stars are formed out of molecular gas with a given
efficiency, which scales with the dynamical time of the cold phase. Our
prescription for star formation is not based on imposing the Schmidt-Kennicutt
relation, which is instead naturally produced by MUPPI. Energy from supernova
explosions is deposited partly into the hot phase of the gas particles, and
partly to that of neighboring particles. Mass and energy flows among the
different phases of each particle are described by a set of ordinary
differential equations which we explicitly integrate for each gas particle,
instead of relying on equilibrium solutions. This system of equations also
includes the response of the multi-phase structure to energy changes associated
to the thermodynamics of the gas. We apply our model to two isolated disk
galaxy simulations and two spherical cooling flows. MUPPI is able to reproduce
the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation for disc galaxies. It also reproduces the basic
properties of the inter-stellar medium in disc galaxies, the surface densities
of cold and molecular gas, of stars and of star formation rate, the vertical
velocity dispersion of cold clouds and the flows connected to the galactic

illustrate some certain circumstances where this irreversible process can in
fact induce entanglement between separated systems. We also show how
spontaneous emission reveals a competition between the Bell states of a two
qubit system that leads to the recently discovered ""sudden"" features in the
temporal evolution of entanglement. An another problem illustrated in details
is a deterministic preparation of atoms and atomic ensembles in long-lived
stationary squeezed states and entangled cluster states. We then determine how
to trigger the evolution of the stable entanglement and also address the issue
of a steered evolution of entanglement between desired pairs of qubits that can

detect small differences in the ionization parameter and column density in the
highest ionized component of the outflow. This constrains the location of this
component of the outflow to within 0.5 pc of the central source. Our method for
modeling the relative effective area is not restricted to just this source and
can in principle be extended to other types of sources as well.

derived a method to calculate the catenary and tame degree from the monoid of
relations, and they applied this method successfully in the case of numerical
monoids. In this paper, we investigate the algebraic structure of this
approach. Thereby, we dispense with the restriction to finitely generated
monoids and give applications to other invariants of non-unique factorizations,
such as the elasticity and the set of distances.

observable: (i) Considering the current theoretical knowledge, what novel
information does new measurement bring in? (ii) How can new data reduce
uncertainties of current theoretical models? We illustrate these points by
studying the radius of the neutron distribution of a heavy nucleus, a quantity
related to the equation of state for neutron matter that determines properties
of nuclei and neutron stars. By systematically varying parameters of two
theoretical models and studying the resulting confidence ellipsoid, we quantify
the relationships between the neutron skin and various properties of finite
nuclei and infinite nuclear matter. Using the covariance analysis, we identify
observables and pseudo-observables that correlate, and do not correlate, with
the neutron skin. By adding the information on the neutron radius to the pool
of observables determining the energy functional, we show how precise
experimental determination of the neutron radius in $^{208}$Pb would reduce
theoretical uncertainties on the neutron matter equation of state.
