the better channels to probe the TC2 is the production of $\tau\bar \mu$ or
$\tau\bar e$ which occurs at a much higher rate than $\mu\bar e$ production due
to the large mixing angle and the large flavor changing coupling, and may reach
the detectable level of the ILC for a large part of the parameter space. Since
the rates predicted by the Standard Model are far below the detectable level,
these processes may serve as a sensitive probe for the TC2 model.

  MMI",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Maximum mutual information (MMI) is a model selection criterion used for
hidden Markov model (HMM) parameter estimation that was developed more than
twenty years ago as a discriminative alternative to the maximum likelihood
criterion for HMM-based speech recognition. It has been shown in the speech
recognition literature that parameter estimation using the current MMI
paradigm, lattice-based MMI, consistently outperforms maximum likelihood
estimation, but this is at the expense of undesirable convergence properties.
In particular, recognition performance is sensitive to the number of times that
the iterative MMI estimation algorithm, extended Baum-Welch, is performed. In
fact, too many iterations of extended Baum-Welch will lead to degraded
performance, despite the fact that the MMI criterion improves at each
iteration. This phenomenon is at variance with the analogous behavior of
maximum likelihood estimation -- at least for the HMMs used in speech
recognition -- and it has previously been attributed to `over fitting'. In this
paper, we present an analysis of lattice-based MMI that demonstrates, first of
all, that the asymptotic behavior of lattice-based MMI is much worse than was
previously understood, i.e. it does not appear to converge at all, and, second
of all, that this is not due to `over fitting'. Instead, we demonstrate that
the `over fitting' phenomenon is the result of standard methodology that
exacerbates the poor behavior of two key approximations in the lattice-based
MMI machinery. We also demonstrate that if we modify the standard methodology
to improve the validity of these approximations, then the convergence
properties of lattice-based MMI become benign without sacrificing improvements
to recognition accuracy.

least for clusters with ages t<10^9 yr and masses M<10^3 M_sol (more
specifically, t<10^7(M/10^2 M_sol)^{1.3} yr). This model predicts that the
clusters should have a power-law luminosity function, dN/dL propto L^-1.8, in
agreement with observations. The first two models, on the other hand, fare
poorly when describing the observations, refuting previous claims that
mass-dependent disruption of star clusters is observed in the LMC over the
studied M-t domain. Clusters in the SMC can be described by the same g(M,t)
distribution as for the LMC, but with smaller samples and hence larger
uncertainties. The successful g(M,t) model for clusters in the Magellanic
Clouds is virtually the same as the one for clusters in the merging Antennae
galaxies, but extends the domain of validity to lower masses and to older ages.
This indicates that the dominant disruption processes are similar in these very
different galaxies over at least t<10^8 yr and possibly t<10^9 yr. The mass
functions for young clusters in the LMC are power-laws, while that for ancient
globular clusters is peaked. We show that the observed shapes of these mass

in such a way that the system is asymptotically stable. Now as N tends tends we
consider the following problem. At t=0 the leader gets kicked and starts moving
with unit velocity away from the flock. Due to asymptotic stability the
followers will eventually fall in behind the leader and travel each at its own
predetermined distance from the leader. In this note we conjecture that before
equilibrium ensues, the perturbations to the orbit of the last oscillator grow
exponentially in N except when there is a symmetry in the interactions and the
growth is then linear in N. There are two cases. We prove the conjecture in one
case, and give a strong heuristic argument in the other.

Calder\'on-Zygmund type and exhibit behavior different from their counterparts
built upon the Laplacian. The current paper aims at a thorough description of
the properties of such operators in $L^p$, Sobolev, and some new Hardy spaces
naturally associated to $L$.
  First, we show that the known ranges of boundedness in $L^p$ for the heat
semigroup and Riesz transform of $L$, are sharp. In particular, the heat
semigroup $e^{-tL}$ need not be bounded in $L^p$ if $p\not\in

Sobolev spaces in which $L$ admits a bounded functional calculus, in
particular, where $e^{-tL}$ is bounded.
  Secondly, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hardy and Lipschitz spaces
associated to $L$, that serves the range of $p$ beyond $[2n/(n+2),2n/(n-2)]$.
It includes, in particular, characterizations by the sharp maximal function and
the Riesz transform (for certain ranges of $p$), as well as the molecular

The underlying general result of manifold stability of a mean on a shape space,
the quotient due to an isometric action of a compact Lie group on a Riemannian
manifold, blends the Slice Theorem from differential geometry with the
statistics of shape. For 3D Procrustes means, however, a counterexample is
given. To further elucidate on subtleties of means, for spheres and Kendall's

residual/Procrustean and extrinsic/Ziezold means is derived stating that for
high concentration the latter approximately divides the (generalized) geodesic

coordinate choices for the power of tests and other details, e.g. that

the fitness distribution among different teams. The limits of predictability of

spectra of the Seyfert 2 galaxy, Mrk573. This analysis is complemented by the

data. The soft X-ray emission is mainly due to gas photoionised by the central
AGN, as indicated by the detection of radiative recombination continua from
OVII and OVIII, as well as by the prominence of the OVII forbidden line. This
result is confirmed by the best fit obtained with a self-consistent CLOUDY
photoionisation model. However, a collisionally excited component is also
required, in order to reproduce the FeXVII lines, accounting for about 1/3 of
the total luminosity in the 15-26 A band. Once adopted the same model in the
Chandra ACIS data, another photoionised component, with higher ionisation
parameter, is needed to take into account emission from higher Z metals. The
broadband ACIS spectrum also confirms the Compton-thick nature of the source.
The imaging analysis shows the close morphological correspondence between the
soft X-ray and the [OIII] emission. The radio emission appears much more
compact, although clearly aligned with the narrow line region. The collisional
phase of the soft X-ray emission may be due to starburst, requiring a star
formation rate of $\simeq5-9$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, but there is no clear
evidence of this kind of activity from other wavelengths. On the other hand, it
may be related to the radio ejecta, responsible for the heating of the plasma
interacting with the outflow, but the estimated pressure of the hot gas is much
larger than the pressure of the radio jets, assuming equipartition and under
reasonable physical parameters.

The intermediate age candidates were found to be the oldest in our sample, with
ages between 1-2 Gyrs. The remaining clusters found in the SOAR/SOI have ages

blazars, we followed the activity in the jet of the blazar PKS 1510-089 during
major outbursts during the first half of 2009. The most revealing event was a
two-month long outburst that featured a number of gamma-ray flares. During the
outburst, the position angle of optical linear polarization rotated by about
720 degrees, which implies that a single emission feature was responsible for
all of the flares during the outburst. At the end of the rotation, a new
superluminal knot (~ 22c) passed through the ""core"" seen on 43 GHz VLBA images
at essentially the same time as an extremely sharp, high-amplitude gamma-ray
and optical flare occurred. We associate the entire multi-flare outburst with
this knot. The ratio of gamma-ray to synchrotron integrated flux indicates that
some of the gamma-ray flares resulted from inverse Compton scattering of seed
photons outside the ultra-fast spine of the jet. Because many of the flares
occurred over time scales of days or even hours, there must be a number of
sources of IR-optical-UV seed photons -- probably synchrotron emission --
surrounding the spine, perhaps in a slower sheath of the jet.

the universal Leibnitz-Hopf algebra with the antipode $\chi(d_k)=(-1)^kd_k$.
Using the operators $d_k$ we build the generalized $f$-polynomial, which is a
ring homomorphism from $\mathcal{P}$ to the ring $\Qsym[t_1,t_2,...][\alpha]$
of quasi-symmetric functions with coefficients in $\mathbb Z[\alpha]$. The
images of two polytopes coincide if and only if their flag $f$-vectors are
equal. We describe the image of this homomorphism over the integers and prove
that over the rationals it is a free polynomial algebra with dimension of the
$n$-th graded component equal to the $n$-th Fibonacci number. This gives a
representation of the Fibonacci series as an infinite product. The homomorphism
is an isomorphism on the graded group $BB$ generated by the polytopes
introduced by Bayer and Billera to find the linear span of flag $f$-vectors of
convex polytopes. This gives the group $BB$ a structure of the ring isomorphic
to $f(\mathcal{P})$. We show that the ring of polytopes has a natural Hopf
comodule structure over the Rota-Hopf algebra of posets. As a corollary we
build a ring homomorphism $l_{\alpha}\colon\mathcal{P}\to\mathcal{R}[\alpha]$

the magnetic field is a Gaussian, isotropic random variable and that it is

the errors due to sampling by making multiple two-dimensional realizations of
the best-fitting power spectrum.We also use depolarization measurements to
estimate the minimum scale of the field variations. We then make
three-dimensional models with a gas density distribution derived from X-ray
observations and a random magnetic field with this power spectrum. Under these

consistent with a broken power-law magnetic-field power spectrum, with a break
at about 11 kpc and slopes of 2.98 and 2.07 at smaller and larger scales

include surface brightness profiles which display a Freeman Type II structure;
HI and ionized gas rotation curves; the stellar rotation, which is nearly
coincident with the ionized gas curve; and the line of sight stellar
dispersion, with a sigma-drop at the centre. The galaxy models consist of a
Sersic bulge, an exponential disc with an optional inner truncation and a
cosmologically motivated dark halo. The Bayesian/MCMC technique yields the
joint posterior probability distribution function for the input parameters. We
examine several interpretations of the data: the Type II surface brightness
profile may be due to dust extinction, to an inner truncated disc or to a ring
of bright stars; and we test separate fits to the gas and stellar rotation
curves to determine if the gas traces the gravitational potential. We test each
of these scenarios for bar stability, ruling out dust extinction. We also find
that the gas likely does not trace the gravitational potential, since the
predicted stellar rotation curve is then inconsistent with the observed stellar
rotation curve. The disc is well fit by an inner-truncated profile, but the
possibility of ring formation by a bar to reproduce the Type II profile is also
a realistic model. We further find that the halo must have a cuspy profile with
gamma > 1; the bulge has a lower M/L than the disc, suggesting a star forming
component in the centre of the galaxy; and the bulge, as expected for this late
type galaxy, has a low Sersic index with n_b~1-2, suggesting a formation
history dominated by secular evolution.

kinetic energy of the scalar field (often referred to as pure kinetic models)
possess no non-adiabatic pressure perturbation. While we are able to construct
models that seemingly depend on the scalar field and also do not contain any
non-adiabatic pressure perturbation, we find that all such models that we
construct allow a redefinition of the field under which they reduce to pure
kinetic models. We show that, if a perfect scalar field drives inflation, then,
in such situations, the first slow roll parameter will always be a
monotonically decreasing function of time. We point out that this behavior
implies that these scalar fields can not lead to features in the inflationary,
scalar perturbation spectrum.

conjecture and well-celebrated Schramm's Stochastic Loewner Evolution (SLE). It
provides analytic description of expanding domains dynamics in the plane. Two
cases have been developed in the classical theory, namely the {\it radial} and
the {\it chordal} Loewner evolutions, referring to the associated families of
holomorphic self-mappings being normalized at an internal or boundary point of
the reference domain, respectively. Recently there has been introduced a new
approach [arXiv:0807.1594v1, arXiv:0807.1715v1, arXiv:0902.3116v1] bringing
together, and containing as quite special cases, radial and chordal variants of
Loewner Theory. In the framework of this approach we address the question what
kind of systems of simply connected domains can be described by means of
Loewner chains of chordal type. As an answer to this question we establish a
necessary and sufficient condition for a set of simply connected domains to be
the range of a generalized Loewner chain of chordal type. We also provide an
easy-to-check geometric sufficient condition for that. In addition, we obtain
analogous results for the less general case of chordal Loewner evolution

a dimensionless scale, $s$, can be fine-tuned in order to control the dynamics
of active and sterile neutrinos through cosmon-type equations of motion: the
seesaw cosmon equations. This allows for sterile neutrinos to be a dark matter
candidate. In this scenario, the dynamical masses and energy densities of
active and sterile neutrinos can be consistently embedded into the generalized
Chaplygin gas (GCG), the unified dark sector model. In addition, dark matter
adiabatically coupled to dark energy allows for a natural decoupling of the
(active) mass varying neutrino (MaVaN) component from the dark sector. Thus
MaVaN's turn into a secondary effect. Through the scale parameters, $\xi$ and
$s$, the proposed scenario allows for a convergence among three distinct
frameworks: the cosmon scenario, the seesaw mechanism for mass generation and
the GCG model. It is found that the equation of state of the perturbations is
the very one of the GCG background cosmology so that all the results from this
approach are maintained, being smoothly modified by active neutrinos.
Constrained by the seesaw relations, it is shown that the mass varying
mechanism is responsible for the stability against linear perturbations and is
indirectly related to the late time cosmological acceleration.

Searches for nearly antipodal circles in maps of cosmic microwave background

theoretical results concerning the detectability of nearly flat compact
topologies is sufficient to exclude a detectable nontrivial topology for most
observers in very nearly flat positively and negatively curved Universes
($0<|\Omega_{tot}-1| \lesssim 10^{-5}$). Here we investigate the consequences
of these searches for observable nontrivial topologies if the Universe turns
out to be exactly flat ($\Omega_{tot}=1$). We demonstrate that in this case the
conclusions deduced from such searches can be radically different. We show that
for all multiply-connected orientable flat manifolds it is possible to directly
study the action of the holonomies in order to obtain a general upper bound on
the angle that characterizes the deviation from antipodicity of pairs of
matching circles associated with the shortest closed geodesic. This bound is
valid for all observers and all possible values of the compactification length
parameters. We also show that in a flat Universe there are observers for whom
the circles-in-the-sky searches already undertaken are insufficient to exclude
the possibility of a detectable nontrivial spatial topology. It is remarkable
how such small variations in the spatial curvature of the Universe, which are
effectively indistinguishable geometrically, can have such a drastic effect on
the detectability of cosmic topology.

mass. The younger satellite galaxies in 6E12Msun halos have stellar populations
consistent with the central galaxies found in the lowest mass halos of our

relationship with a larger sample of 392 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts,
we find that the UV slope can be used to recover the dust attenuation of the
vast majority of L* galaxies at z~2 to within 0.4 dex scatter using the local
correlation. Separately, young galaxies with ages <100 Myr appear to follow an
extinction curve that is steeper than the one found for local starburst
galaxies. Therefore, such young galaxies may be significantly less dusty than
inferred previously. Our results provide the first direct evidence, independent
of the UV slope, for a correlation between UV and bolometric luminosity at high
redshift, in the sense that UV-faint galaxies are also on average less infrared
and less bolometrically-luminous than their UV-bright counterparts. Further, as
the SFR increases, the UV luminosity reaches a maximum value corresponding to
L* at z~2, implying that dust obscuration may be largely responsible for
modulating the bright-end of the UV luminosity function. L* galaxies at z~2,
while at least an order of magnitude more bolometrically-luminous, exhibit
ratios of metals-to-dust that are similar to those of local starbursts. This
result is expected if high-redshift galaxies are forming their stars in a less

naturally leading to a redshift evolution in both the luminosity-metallicity

observed UV and Lyman Alpha LFs, such that the intrinsic Lyman
Alpha-to-continuum luminosity is enhanced by a factor f_alpha/f_c ~ 1.5 (3.7)

critical unanswered questions: the workings of nurture effects on galaxies and
the whereabouts of the missing baryons. In this paper, we analyze the
distribution of dark matter and semianalytical galaxies in the Millennium
Simulation to investigate these problems. Applying the same density field
reconstruction schemes as used for the overall matter distribution to the
matter locked in halos we study the mass contribution of halos to the total
mass budget at various background field densities, i.e., the conditional halo
mass function. In this context, we present a simple fitting formula for the
cumulative mass function accurate to ~ 5% for halo masses between 10^{10} and
10^{15}Msol/h. We find that in dense environments the halo mass function
becomes top heavy and present corresponding fitting formulae for different
redshifts. We demonstrate that the major fraction of matter in high-density
fields is associated with galaxy groups. Since current X-ray surveys are able
to nearly recover the universal baryon fraction within groups, our results
indicate that the major part of the so-far undetected warm-hot intergalactic
medium resides in low-density regions at low temperatures. Similarly, we show
that the differences in galaxy mass functions with environment seen in observed
and simulated data stem predominantly from differences in the mass distribution
of halos. In particular, the hump in the galaxy mass function is associated
with the central group galaxies, and the bimodality observed in the galaxy mass
function is therefore interpreted as that of central galaxies versus
satellites.

vital clues to the enigmatic physics of their dark matter halos. We fit
published data for fourteen such galaxies using a spherical, self-gravitating
model with two components: (1) a Sersic stellar profile fixed according to
photometric parameters, and (2) a polytropic dark matter halo that conforms
consistently to the shared gravitational potential. The polytropic equation of
state can describe extended theories of dark matter involving self-interaction,
non-extensive thermostatistics, or boson condensation (in a classical limit).
In such models, the flat-cored mass profiles widely observed in disc galaxies
are due to innate dark physics, regardless of any baryonic agitation. One of
the natural parameters of this scenario is the number of effective thermal
degrees of freedom of dark matter (F_d) which is proportional to the dark heat
capacity. By default we assume a cosmic ratio of baryonic and dark mass.
Non-Sersic kinematic ideosyncrasies and possible non-sphericity thwart fitting
in some cases. In all fourteen galaxies the fit with a polytropic dark halo
improves or at least gives similar fits to the velocity dispersion profile,
compared to a stars-only model. The good halo fits usually prefer F_d values
from six to eight. This range complements the recently inferred limit of
7<F_d<10 (Saxton & Wu), derived from constraints on galaxy cluster core radii

isolated field elliptical galaxies. We create a mock catalogue of isolated
field elliptical galaxies from the Millennium Simulation Galaxy Catalogue, and
trace their merging histories. The formation, identity and assembly redshifts
of simulated isolated and non-isolated elliptical galaxies are studied and
compared. Observational and numerical data are used to compare age, mass, and
the colour-magnitude relation. Our results, based on simulation data, show that
almost seven per cent of all elliptical galaxies brighter than -19mag in B-band
can be classified as isolated field elliptical galaxies. Isolated field
elliptical galaxies show bluer colours than non-isolated elliptical galaxies
and they appear younger, in a statistical sense, according to their mass
weighted age. Isolated field elliptical galaxies also form and assemble at
lower redshifts compared to non-isolated elliptical galaxies. About 46 per cent
of isolated field elliptical galaxies have undergone at least one major merging
event in their formation history, while the same fraction is only about 33 per
cent for non-isolated ellipticals. The mean time of the last major merging is z
= 0.6 or 6 Gyrs ago for isolated ellipticals, while non-isolated ellipticals
experience their last major merging significantly earlier at z = 1.1 or 8 Gyrs
ago. After inspecting merger trees of simulated isolated field elliptical
galaxies, we conclude that three different, yet typical formation mechanisms
can be identified: solitude, coupling and cannibalism. Our results also predict
a previously unobserved population of blue, dim and light galaxies that fulfill
observational criteria to be classified as isolated field elliptical galaxies.
This separate population comprises about 26 per cent of all IfEs.

derive the SN Ia rate as a function of progenitor age (the delay time

to analyze the SDSS spectra of all galaxies in the field searched by SDSS-SN,
giving us a reference sample of 77,000 galaxies for our SN Ia hosts. Our method
does not assume any a priori shape for the DTD and therefore is minimally
parametric. We present the DTD in physical units for high stretch (luminous,
slow declining) and low stretch (subluminous, fast declining) supernovae in
three progenitor age bins. We find strong evidence of two progenitor channels:
one that produces high stretch SNe Ia $\lesssim 400$ Myr after the birth of the
progenitor system, and one that produces low stretch SNe Ia with a delay
$\gtrsim 2.4$ Gyr. We find that each channel contributes roughly half of the
Type Ia rate in our reference sample. We also construct the average spectra of
high stretch and low stretch SN Ia host galaxies, and find that the difference
of these spectra looks like a main sequence B star with nebular emission lines
indicative of star formation. This supports our finding that there are two
populations of SNe Ia, and indicates that the progenitors of high stretch SNe
are at the least associated with very recent star formation in the last few
tens of Myr. Our results provide valuable constraints for models of Type Ia
progenitors and may help improve the calibration of SNe Ia as standard candles.

to a Poisson point in the Euclidean plane, slotted Aloha Medium Access (MAC)
protocol and the so-called outage scenario, where a successful transmission
requires a Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise (SINR) larger than some threshold.
We analyze the local delays in such a network, namely the number of times slots
required for nodes to transmit a packet to their prescribed next-hop receivers.
The analysis depends very much on the receiver scenario and on the variability
of the fading. In most cases, each node has finite-mean geometric random delay
and thus a positive next hop throughput. However, the spatial (or large
population) averaging of these individual finite mean-delays leads to infinite
values in several practical cases, including the Rayleigh fading and positive
thermal noise case. In some cases it exhibits an interesting phase transition
phenomenon where the spatial average is finite when certain model parameters
are below a threshold and infinite above. We call this phenomenon, contention
phase transition. We argue that the spatial average of the mean local delays is
infinite primarily because of the outage logic, where one transmits full
packets at time slots when the receiver is covered at the required SINR and
where one wastes all the other time slots. This results in the ""RESTART""
mechanism, which in turn explains why we have infinite spatial average.
Adaptive coding offers a nice way of breaking the outage/RESTART logic. We show
examples where the average delays are finite in the adaptive coding case,
whereas they are infinite in the outage case.

to be crucial for the physics of these systems.
  We identify three distinct phases: 'critical' superconductive state formed at

pairing of weakly localized electrons and insulating state realized at $E_F$
still deeper inside localized band. The 'critical' superconducting phase is
characterized by the enhancement of the transition temperature with respect to

parameter and local density of states. The major new feature of the
pseudo-gaped state is the presence of two independent energy scales:
superconducting gap $\Delta$, that is due to many-body correlations and a new
""pseudogap"" energy scale $\Delta_P$ which characterizes typical binding energy
of localized electron pairs and leads to the insulating behavior of the

sets in and how it affects the final abundances at the surface. In particular,

vary with the initial mass, which results in different final abundances in the

networks. Peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays provide an environment that can return
ownership of information, trust, and control to the users, away from
centralized third-party social networks.
  In this paper, we present a novel concept, social profile overlays, which
enable users to share their profile only with trusted peers in a scalable,
reliable, and private manner. Each user's profile consists of a unique private,
secure overlay, where members of that overlay have a friendship with the
overlay owner. Profile data is made available without regard to the online
state of the profile owner through the use of the profile overlay's distributed
data store. Privacy and security are enforced through the use of a public key
infrastructure (PKI), where the role of certificate authority (CA) is handled
by the overlay owner and each member of the overlay has a CA-signed
certificate. All members of the social network join a common public or
directory overlay facilitating friend discovery and bootstrap connections into
profile overlays. We define interfaces and present tools that can be used to
implement this system, as well as explore some of the challenges related to it.

Mitigation effects are explored depending on the interplay between the

is calibrated using recent estimates on the transmissibility of the new A(H1N1)

our imaging and spectroscopic data, NGC 7354 has four main structures: a quite
round outer shell and an elliptical inner shell, a collection of low-excitation
bright knots roughly concentrated on the equatorial region of the nebula, and
two symmetrical jet-like features, not aligned either with the shells' axes, or
with each other. We have obtained physical parameters like electron temperature
and electron density as well as ionic and elemental abundances for these
different structures. Electron temperature and electron density slightly vary
throughout the nebula. The local extinction coefficient c_Hbeta shows an
increasing gradient from south to north and a decreasing gradient from east to
west consistent with the number of equatorial bright knots present in each
direction. Abundance values show slight internal variations but most of them
are within the estimated uncertainties. In general, abundance values are in
good agreement with the ones expected for PNe. Radio continuum data are
consistent with optically thin thermal emission. We have used the interactive
three-dimensional modeling tool SHAPE to reproduce the observed morphokinematic
structures in NGC 7354 with different geometrical components. Our SHAPE model
is in very good agreement with our imaging and spectroscopic observations.
Finally, after modeling NGC 7354 with SHAPE, we suggest a possible scenario for

superhydrophobic surfaces that lead to various novel behaviors [1-5]. These
observations have inspired attempts to create artificial superhydrophobic
surfaces, given such surfaces have multitudinous applications [6-13].
Superhydrophobicity is an enhanced effect of surface roughness and there are
known relationships that correlate surface roughness and superhydrophobicity,
based on the underlying physics. However, while these recognize the level of
roughness they tell us little about the independent effect of its scale. Thus,
they are not capable of explaining why naturally occurring such surfaces
commonly have micron-submicron sizes. Here we report on the discovery of a new
relation, its physical basis and its experimental verification. The results
reveal that scaling-down roughness into the micro-submicron range is a unique
and elegant strategy to not only achieve superhydrophobicity but also to
increase its stability against environmental disturbances. This new relation
takes into account the previously overlooked but key fact that the accumulated
line energy arising from the numerous solid-water-air intersections that can be
distributed in the apparent contact area when air packets are trapped at small
scales on the surface can dramatically increase as the roughness scale shrinks.
This term can in fact become the dominant contributor to the surface energy and
so becomes crucial for accomplishing superhydrophobicity. These findings guide
fabrication of stable super water-repellant surfaces.

the greatest challenges to ground-based surveys for transiting Hot Jupiters. We
have used known properties of multiple star systems and Hot Jupiter systems to
predict, a priori, the number of such false detections and the number of
genuine planet detections recovered in two hypothetical but realistic
ground-based transit surveys targeting fields close to the galactic plane (b~10
degrees): a shallow survey covering a magnitude range 10<V<13, and a deep
survey covering a magnitude range 15<V<19. Our results are consistent with the
commonly-reported experience of false detections outnumbering planet detections
by a factor of ~10 in shallow surveys, while in our synthetic deep survey we
find ~1-2 false detections for every planet detection. We characterize the
eclipsing binary configurations that are most likely to cause false detections
and find that they can be divided into three main types: (i) two dwarfs
undergoing grazing transits, (ii) two dwarfs undergoing low-latitude transits
in which one component has a substantially smaller radius than the other, and
(iii) two eclipsing dwarfs blended with one or more physically unassociated
foreground stars. We also predict that a significant fraction of Hot Jupiter
detections are blended with the light from other stars, showing that care must
be taken to identify the presence of any unresolved neighbors in order to
obtain accurate estimates of planetary radii. This issue is likely to extend to
terrestrial planet candidates in the CoRoT and Kepler transit surveys, for
which neighbors of much fainter relative brightness will be important.

shows two shallow decay episodes that are likely due to energy injection, which
end at $\sim 230$ seconds and $\sim 7100$ seconds, respectively. The decay
slopes post the injection phases are consistent with each other ($\alpha\simeq
1.22$). The X-ray afterglow lightcurve appears to trace the optical, although
the second energy injection phase was missed due to visibility constraints
introduced by the {\em Swift} orbit. The X-ray spectral index is $\beta_X\sim
1.0$ without temporal evolution. Its decay slope is consistent with the
prediction of the forward shock model. Both X-ray and optical emission is
consistent with being in the same spectral regime above the cooling frequency
($\nu_c$). The fact that $\nu_c$ is below the optical band from the very early
epoch of the observation provides a constraint on the burst environment, which
is similar to that seen in classical long duration GRBs. We therefore suggest
that death of a massive star is the possible progenitor of this short burst.

computational advantage over the direct measurement of Taylor coefficients at

two resonant CW peaks and two Rabi oscillations of the quantum dot current by
sweeping an external magnetic field at a fixed frequency. Two peaks and
oscillations are measured at different resonant magnetic field, which reflects
the fact that the local magnetic fields at each quantum dot are modulated by
the stray field of a micro-magnet. As predicted with a density matrix approach,
the CW current is quadratic with respect to microwave (MW) voltage while the
Rabi frequency (\nu_Rabi) is linear. The difference between the \nu_Rabi values
of two Rabi oscillations directly reflects the MW electric field across the two

the puzzles of quantum mechanics: e.g., that it allows a Lorentz-invariant
explanation of Bell correlations, and other manifestations of quantum
nonlocality, without action-at-a-distance. Some writers have argued that
time-symmetry counts in favour of such a view, in the sense that retrocausality
would be a natural consequence of a truly time-symmetric theory of the quantum
world. Critics object that there is complete time-symmetry in classical
physics, and yet no apparent retrocausality. Why should the quantum world be
any different? This note throws some new light on these matters. I call
attention to a respect in which quantum mechanics is different, under some
assumptions about quantum ontology. Under these assumptions, the combination of
time-symmetry without retrocausality is unavailable in quantum mechanics, for
reasons intimately connected with the differences between classical and quantum
physics (especially the role of discreteness in the latter). Not all
interpretations of quantum mechanics share these assumptions, however, and in
those that do not, time-symmetry does not entail retrocausality.

thick torus with a very small opening angle. We investigate correlations
between the scattering fraction and multiwavelength properties. We find that
AGNs with a small scattering fraction tend to have low [O III]lambda5007/X-ray
luminosity ratios. This result agrees with the expectation that the extent of
the narrow-line region is small because of the small opening angle of the
torus. There is no significant correlation between scattering fraction and
far-infrared luminosity. This implies that a scale height of the torus is not
primarily determined by starburst activity. We also compare scattering fraction
with black hole mass or Eddington ratio and find a weak anti-correlation
between the Eddington ratio and scattering fraction. This implies that more

operations to encode a negation on {\it concepts}. They have been introduced to
capture the equational theory of concept algebras \cite{Wi00}. They generalize
Boolean algebras. Concept algebras are concept lattices, thus complete
lattices, with a weak negation and a weak opposition. A special case of the
representation problem for weakly dicomplemented lattices, posed in
\cite{Kw04}, is whether complete {\wdl}s are isomorphic to concept algebras. In
this contribution we give a negative answer to this question (Theorem
\ref{T:main}). We also provide a new proof of a well known result due to M.H.
Stone \cite{St36}, saying that {\em each Boolean algebra is a field of sets}

in the Fock space from $t=T_1$ to $t=T_2$, where the interval $(T_1,T_2)$

  From these networks, we are able to record the degree of a trader, the size

other variables that are of interest. The distributions of all these variables

the most naive agent-based model, ZI indeed best describes the properties

produce the observed properties from real world markets could in fact be the
result of a continuously evolving dynamical system with basic features similar

in principle accessible through ultrafast non-linear spectroscopy. Considering
a direct excitation of a small molecular antenna by incoherent light we find
that excitation of coherences is possible due to overlap of homogeneous line
shapes associated with different excitonic states. In Markov and secular
approximations, the amount of coherence is significant only under fast
relaxation, and both the populations and coherences between exciton states
become static at long time. We also study the case when the excitation of a
photosynthetic complex is mediated by a mesoscopic system. We find that such
case can be treated by the same formalism with a special correlation function

maximally entangled particles is measured, without measurement the state of
another one is determined simultaneously no matter how far the two particles is
from each other. How can these phenomena take place since no object can move
faster than light speed in a vacuum? The key problem is due to the ignorance of
the interaction between a particle and a quantum vacuum. Just like the case
where a gun suffers recoil from its firing of a bullet, when a particle is
created from the quantum vacuum, the vacuum will be somewhat ""broken""
correspondingly, which can be described by a shadow state in the vacuum.
Through their shadows in the vacuum two quantum entangled particles can have a
distance-independent instantaneous interaction with each other. Quantum
teleportation, quantum swap, and wave function collapse are explained in a
similar way. Quantum object can be interpreted as a composite made up of a
particle and the shadowed quantum vacuum which is responsible for the wave
characteristic of the particle wave duality. The quantum vacuum is not only the
origin of all possible kinds of particles, but also the origin and the core of
Eastern mystics.

management for so-called trajectory databases that capture the historical
movements of populations of moving objects becomes important. This paper
considers the querying of such databases for convoys, a convoy being a group of
objects that have traveled together for some time. More specifically, this
paper formalizes the concept of a convoy query using density-based notions, in
order to capture groups of arbitrary extents and shapes. Convoy discovery is
relevant for real-life applications in throughput planning of trucks and
carpooling of vehicles. Although there has been extensive research on
trajectories in the literature, none of this can be applied to retrieve
correctly exact convoy result sets. Motivated by this, we develop three
efficient algorithms for convoy discovery that adopt the well-known
filter-refinement framework. In the filter step, we apply line-simplification
techniques on the trajectories and establish distance bounds between the
simplified trajectories. This permits efficient convoy discovery over the
simplified trajectories without missing any actual convoys. In the refinement
step, the candidate convoys are further processed to obtain the actual convoys.
Our comprehensive empirical study offers insight into the properties of the
paper's proposals and demonstrates that the proposals are effective and
efficient on real-world trajectory data.

multiterminal structures at very low temperatures. The investigated samples,
fabricated by e-beam lithography and shadow evaporation, consist of a
superconducting aluminum bar with several copper wires forming tunnel contacts
at different distances from each other. We have measured in detail the local
and non-local conductance of these structures as a function of the applied bias
voltage V, the applied magnetic field B, the temperature T and the contact
distance d. From these data the charge-imbalance relaxation length lambda_Q* is
derived. The bias-resolved measurements show a transition from dominant elastic
scattering close to the energy gap to an inelastic two-stage relaxation at
higher bias. We observe a strong suppression of charge imbalance with magnetic
field, which can be directly linked to the pair-breaking parameter. In
contrast, practically no temperature dependence of the charge-imbalance signal
was observed below 0.5 K. These results are relevant for the investigation of
other non-local effects such as crossed Andreev reflexion and spin diffusion.

energy cascades from large to small scales. Our simulations also show that when

predicted by the standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis, according to the
specifications found by the satellite WMAP. After gathering a homogeneous

disagreement between Big Bang and stellar abundances are discussed (including
early astration and diffusion). On the other hand, possibilities of lower

two software engineering approaches that contribute to enable the rapid
building and evolution of applications. Nevertheless, few approaches have
proposed a framework to combine agile and component-based development, allowing
an application to be tested throughout the entire development cycle. To address
this problematic, we have built CALICO, a model-based framework that allows
applications to be safely developed in an iterative and incremental manner. The
CALICO approach relies on the synchronization of a model view, which specifies
the application properties, and a runtime view, which contains the application
in its execution context. Tests on the application specifications that require
values only known at runtime, are automatically integrated by CALICO into the
running application, and the captured needed values are reified at execution
time to resume the tests and inform the architect of potential problems. Any
modification at the model level that does not introduce new errors is
automatically propagated to the running system, allowing the safe evolution of
the application. In this paper, we illustrate the CALICO development process
with a concrete example and provide information on the current implementation
of our framework.

technique allows to separate unambiguously contributions of the central, vector

on the analysis of a well-fitted realistic interaction in sdpf-shell model

claimed as underlying the LPPL, is based on influence percolation and a
martingale condition. This paper examines these claims and the robustness of
the LPPL for capturing large falls in the Hang Seng stock market index, over a
30-year period, including the current global downturn. We identify 11 crashes
on the Hang Seng market over the period 1970 to 2008. The fitted LPPLs have
parameter values within the ranges specified post hoc by Johansen and Sornette

predicted the substantial fall in the Hang Seng index during the recent global
downturn. We also find that influence percolation combined with a martingale
condition holds for only half of the pre-crash bubbles previously reported.
Overall, the mechanism posited as underlying the LPPL does not do so, and the
data used to support the fit of the LPPL to bubbles does so only partially.

motivation for considering a light Higgs emerging as a pseudo-Goldstone boson

production and decay differ significantly from those in the Standard Model.
However, one genuine strong coupling signature is the growth with energy of the
scattering amplitudes among the Goldstone bosons, the longitudinally polarized
vector bosons as well as the Higgs boson itself. The rate for double Higgs
production in vector boson fusion is thus enhanced with respect to its
negligible rate in the SM. We study that reaction in pp collisions, where the

two forward jets. We concentrate on the decay mode hh -> WW^(*)WW^(*) and study
the semi-leptonic decay chains of the W's with 2, 3 or 4 leptons in the final

triggered a subsequent two-ribbon flare (event B). Event A was analyzed using a
single-loop model, while a two-ribbon model was applied for event B. Loop
semi-lengths of ~ 4 R* were obtained. Such large structures had been previously
observed in very young stellar objects (~ 1 - 4 Myr). This is the first time
