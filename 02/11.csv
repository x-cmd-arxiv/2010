arbitrary dense graphs, decomposing such graphs into a structured piece (a

edge densities). We establish an arithmetic regularity lemma that similarly
decomposes bounded functions f : [N] -> C, into a (well-equidistributed,
virtual) -step nilsequence, an error which is small in L^2 and a further error
which is miniscule in the Gowers U^{s+1}-norm, where s is a positive integer.
We then establish a complementary arithmetic counting lemma that counts
arithmetic patterns in the nilsequence component of f.
  We provide a number of applications of these lemmas: a proof of Szemeredi's
theorem on arithmetic progressions, a proof of a conjecture of Bergelson, Host

this property. We thank Daniel Altman for drawing our attention to what

the order parameter and for the latter case the angular momentum is chosen as

as background values those obtained from interpolation between concentric
strips around the analyzed loop. The other method is a pixel-to-pixel
subtraction of the final image when the loop had completely faded out, already

different. We find differences as well in the related derive filter ratio and
temperature profiles. In particular, the pixel-to-pixel subtraction leads to
coherent diagnostics of a cooling loop. With the other subtraction the
diagnostics are much less clear. The background subtraction is a delicate issue
in the analysis of a loop. The pixel-to-pixel subtraction appears to be more

star leads to small eccentricities, the planets in this system could be
undergoing resonant coupling even though the period ratios depart significantly
from very precise commensurability. In a three planet system, this is indicated
by the fact that resonant angles librate or are associated with long term
changes to the orbital elements. We propose that the planets in HD 40307 were
in a strict Laplace resonance while they migrated through the disc. After
entering the disc inner cavity, tidal interaction would cause the period ratios
to increase from two but with the inner pair deviating less than the outer
pair, counter to what occurs in HD 40307. However, the relationship between
these pairs that occurs in HD 40307 might be produced if the resonance is
impulsively modified by an event like a close encounter shortly after the
planetary system decouples from the disc. We find this to be in principle
possible for a small relative perturbation on the order of a few 1.d-3 but then
we find that evolution to the present system in a reasonable time is possible
only if the masses are significantly larger than the minimum masses and tidal
dissipation is very effective. On the other hand we found that a system like HD
40307 with minimum masses and more realistic tidal dissipation could be
produced if the eccentricity of the outermost planet was impulsively increased
to about 0.15. The form of resonantly coupled tidal evolution we consider here
is quite general and could be of greater significance for systems with inner
planets on significantly shorter orbital periods characteristic of for example
CoRoT 7 b.

phenomenological and theoretical constraints, and define the corresponding

of the computed frequencies is of the same order of magnitude or better than
the observational errors, some requirements in the equilibrium models and the

thickness dependent. For films with thickness h between 2 <= h <= 9.5 nm, the
morphology during the intermediate stages of dewetting consisted of
bicontinuous structures. For films 11.5 <= h <= 20 nm, the intermediate stages
consisted of regularly-sized holes. Measurement of the characteristic length
scales for different stages of dewetting as a function of film thickness showed
a systematic increase, which is consistent with the spinodal dewetting
instability over the entire thickness range investigated. This change in
morphology with thickness is consistent with observations made previously for
polymer films [A. Sharma et al, Phys. Rev. Lett., v81, pp3463 (1998); R.
Seemann et al, J. Phys. Cond. Matt., v13, pp4925, (2001)]. Based on the
behavior of free energy curvature that incorporates intermolecular forces, we
have estimated the morphological transition thickness for the intermolecular
forces for Ag on SiO2 . The theory predictions agree well with observations for
Ag. These results show that it is possible to form a variety of complex Ag
nanomorphologies in a consistent manner, which could be useful in optical
applications of Ag surfaces, such as in surface enhanced Raman sensing.

properties of Dark Energy in the Universe. As a standard method, the two-point
correlation functions $xi_\pm(theta)$ of the cosmic shear field are used as
statistical measures for the shear field. In order to separate the observed
shear into E- and B-modes, the latter being most likely produced by remaining
systematics in the data set and/or intrinsic alignment effects, several
statistics have been defined before. Here we aim at a complete E-/B-mode
decomposition of the cosmic shear information contained in the $xi_\pm$ on a
finite angular interval. We construct two sets of such E-/B-mode measures,
namely Complete Orthogonal Sets of E-/B-mode Integrals (COSEBIs), characterized
by weight functions between the $xi_\pm$ and the COSEBIs which are polynomials
in $theta$ or polynomials in $ln(theta)$, respectively. Considering the
likelihood in cosmological parameter space, constructed from the COSEBIs, we
study their information contents. We show that the information grows with the
number of COSEBI modes taken into account, and that an asymptotic limit is
reached which defines the maximum available information in the E-mode component
of the $xi_\pm$. We show that this limit is reached the earlier (i.e., for a
smaller number of modes considered) the narrower the angular range is over
which $xi_\pm$ are measured, and it is reached much earlier for logarithmic
weight functions. For example, for $xi_\pm$ on the interval $1'\le \theta\le
400'$, the asymptotic limit for the parameter pair $(Omega_m, sigma_8)$ is
reached for $\sim 25$ modes in the linear case, but already for 5 modes in the
logarithmic case. The COSEBIs form a natural discrete set of quantities, which
we suggest as method of choice in future cosmic shear likelihood analyses.

functions at an infinite reflecting wall. We consider both Schr\""odinger and
phase-space quantum mechanics (a.k.a. deformation quantization), for this
simple example of a contact interaction. A non-relativistic particle moving
freely on the half-line is treated as moving on the full line in the presence
of an infinite potential wall, realized as a limit of a Morse potential. We
show that the wave functions for the Morse states can become those for a free
particle on the half-line with Robin boundary conditions. However, Dirichlet
boundary conditions (standard walls) are obtained unless a mass-dependent fine
tuning (to a reflection resonance) is imposed. This phenomenon was already
observed for piece-wise flat potentials, so it is not removed by smoothing. We
argue that it explains why standard quantum walls are standard. Next we
consider the Wigner functions (the symbols of both diagonal and off-diagonal
density operator elements) of phase-space quantum mechanics. Taking the
(fine-tuned) limit, we show that our Wigner functions do reduce to the expected
ones on the half-line. This confirms that the Wigner transform should indeed be
unmodified for this contact interaction.

emerging flux regions often show redshift (2-16 km/s), while the one with
moving magnetic features show blueshift (around 5 km/s). Detailed analysis of

including minor companions (mass ratio >= 1/10) is roughly two times the number
of major companions alone (mass ratio >= 1/3) in the range 0.2 <= z < 1.1. We
compare the major merger rate derived by close pairs with the one computed by
morphological criteria, finding that both approaches provide similar merger
rates for field galaxies when the progenitor bias is taken into account.
Finally, we estimate that the total (major+minor) merger rate is ~1.7 times the
major merger rate. Only 30% to 50% of the M_star >= 10^10 M_Sun early-type
(E/S0/Sa) galaxies that appear z=1 and z=0 may have undergone a major or a
minor merger. Half of the red sequence growth since z=1 is therefore unrelated
to mergers.

turning all the objectives but one into budget constraints. Some classical
polynomial-time optimization problems, such as spanning tree and forest,
shortest path, (perfect) matching, independent set (basis) in a matroid or in
the intersection of two matroids, become NP-hard even with one budget
constraint. Still, for most of these problems deterministic and randomized
polynomial-time approximation schemes are known. In the case of two or more
budgets, typically only multi-criteria approximation schemes are available,
which return slightly infeasible solutions. Not much is known however for the
case of strict budget constraints: filling this gap is the main goal of this
paper.
  We show that shortest path, perfect matching, and spanning tree (and hence
matroid basis and matroid intersection basis) are inapproximable already with
two budget constraints. For the remaining problems, whose set of solutions
forms an independence system, we present deterministic and randomized
polynomial-time approximation schemes for a constant number k of budget
constraints. Our results are based on a variety of techniques:
  1. We present a simple and powerful mechanism to transform multi-criteria
approximation schemes into pure approximation schemes.
  2. We show that points in low dimensional faces of any matroid polytope are
almost integral, an interesting result on its own. This gives a deterministic
approximation scheme for k-budgeted matroid independent set.
  3. We present a deterministic approximation scheme for 2-budgeted matching.
The backbone of this result is a purely topological property of curves in R^2.

rare in the local Universe, galaxies like the Milky Way form only a few new
stars per year. Typical massive galaxies in the distant Universe formed stars
an order of magnitude more rapidly. Unless star formation was significantly
more efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more gas
rich. Molecular gas observations in the distant Universe have so far been
largely restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers and
quasars. Here we report the results of a systematic survey of molecular gas in
samples of typical massive star forming galaxies at <z>~1.2 and 2.3, when the
Universe was 40% and 24% of its current age. Our measurements provide empirical
evidence that distant star forming galaxies indeed were gas rich, and that the
star formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. The
average fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z= 2.3
and z=1.2 is ~44% and 34%, three to ten times higher than in today's massive
spiral galaxies. The slow decrease between z~2 and 1 probably requires a

Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is explored based on three two-dimensional explosion
simulations representing extreme cases: a pure turbulent deflagration, a
delayed detonation following an approximately spherical ignition of the initial
deflagration, and a delayed detonation arising from a highly asymmetric
deflagration ignition. Apart from this initial condition, the deflagration
stage is treated in a parameter-free approach. The detonation is initiated when
the turbulent burning enters the distributed burning regime. This occurs at
densities around $10^{7}$ g cm$^{-3}$ -- relatively low as compared to existing
nucleosynthesis studies for one-dimensional spherically symmetric models. The
burning in these multidimensional models is different from that in
one-dimensional simulations as the detonation wave propagates both into
unburned material in the high density region near the center of a white dwarf
and into the low density region near the surface. Thus, the resulting yield is
a mixture of different explosive burning products, from carbon-burning products
at low densities to complete silicon-burning products at the highest densities,
as well as electron-capture products synthesized at the deflagration stage. In
contrast to the deflagration model, the delayed detonations produce a
characteristic layered structure and the yields largely satisfy constraints
from Galactic chemical evolution. In the asymmetric delayed detonation model,
the region filled with electron capture species (e.g., $^{58}$Ni, $^{54}$Fe) is
within a shell, showing a large off-set, above the bulk of $^{56}$Ni
distribution, while species produced by the detonation are distributed more
spherically (abridged).

lines of 12CO v=1<-0 and 13CO v=1<-0. A weak CO ice feature at 4.67 micron is

from the cold millimeter emitting gas, which may be associated with the
absorption by cooler gas (45K). The outflowing warm gas at 300-400K and with a
mass-loss rate varying between 0.48E-7 and 4.2E-7 MSun /yr can explain most of
the absorption. Several absorption lines were spectrally resolved in subsequent
spectra obtained with the VLT-CRIRES instrument. Multiple absorption
substructures in the high-resolution (R=100,000) spectra indicate that the
mass-loss is episodic with at least two major events that occurred recently
(<28 years). The discrete mass-loss events together with the large turbulent
width of the gas (dv=10-12 km/s) are consistent with the predictions of the
Jet-Bow shock outflow and the wide-angle wind model. The CO gas/solid column
density ratio of 20-100 in the line-of-sight confirms that the circumstellar

  structure and random effects","24 pages, 2 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The estimation of Bayesian networks given high-dimensional data, in
particular gene expression data, has been the focus of much recent research.
Whilst there are several methods available for the estimation of such networks,
these typically assume that the data consist of independent and identically
distributed samples. However, it is often the case that the available data have
a more complex mean structure plus additional components of variance, which
must then be accounted for in the estimation of a Bayesian network. In this
paper, score metrics that take account of such complexities are proposed for
use in conjunction with score-based methods for the estimation of Bayesian
networks. We propose firstly, a fully Bayesian score metric, and secondly, a
metric inspired by the notion of restricted maximum likelihood. We demonstrate
the performance of these new metrics for the estimation of Bayesian networks
using simulated data with known complex mean structures. We then present the
analysis of expression levels of grape berry genes adjusting for exogenous
variables believed to affect the expression levels of the genes. Demonstrable
biological effects can be inferred from the estimated conditional independence
relationships and correlations amongst the grape-berry genes.

proposed that this observation rules out the existence of an elongated,

consistent with the observation of unpeeling during overstretching. We
demonstrate that assuming the existence of S-DNA does not imply DNA
overstretching to consist of the complete or near-complete conversion of the

argue that such coexistence can rationalize several recent experimental

detonation scenario is a potential explanation for type Ia supernovae. In this
scenario, a surface detonation in a helium layer initiates a detonation in the
underlying carbon/oxygen core leading to an explosion. For a given core mass, a
lower bound has been determined on the mass of the helium shell required for
dynamical burning during a helium flash, which is a necessary prerequisite for
detonation. For a range of core and corresponding minimum helium shell masses,
we investigate whether an assumed surface helium detonation is capable of
triggering a subsequent detonation in the core even for this limiting case. We
carried out hydrodynamic simulations on a co-expanding Eulerian grid in two
dimensions assuming rotational symmetry. The detonations are propagated using
the level-set approach and a simplified scheme for nuclear reactions that has
been calibrated with a large nuclear network. The same network is used to
determine detailed nucleosynthetic abundances in a post-processing step. Based
on approximate detonation initiation criteria in the literature, we find that
secondary core detonations are triggered for all of the simulated models,
ranging in core mass from 0.810 up to 1.385 M_solar with corresponding shell
masses from 0.126 down to 0.0035 M_solar. This implies that, as soon as a
detonation triggers in a helium shell covering a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, a
subsequent core detonation is virtually inevitable.

emerged as efficient tools to describe the nonlinear dynamics of these

microfilaments is the accurate modeling of the constitutive law, which follows
from its atomistic structure and bond-stiffnesses. Since first-principle
derivation of the constitutive law from atomistic structure is impractical and
so are direct experimental measurements due to the small length-scales, a
natural alternative is to estimate the constitutive law from discrete-structure
simulations such as molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. In this paper, we
present a two-step inverse method for estimating the constitutive law using rod
theory and data generated from discrete-structure simulations. We illustrate
the method on a filament with an artificial and simplistic discrete-structure.
We simulate its deformation in response to a prescribed loading using a
multi-body dynamics (MBD) solver. Using data generated from the MBD solver, we
first estimate the curvature of the filament and subsequently use it in the
two-step method to estimate the effective constitutive-law relationship between
the restoring moment and curvature. Finally, we also illustrate how the
estimated constitutive law can be tested under independent loading conditions.

network connectivity regardless of physical location has spurred interest in
the use of mobile ad hoc networks. Since Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is
the standard network protocol for communication in the internet, any wireless
network with Internet service need to be compatible with TCP. TCP is tuned to
perform well in traditional wired networks, where packet losses occur mostly
because of congestion. However, TCP connections in Ad-hoc mobile networks are
plagued by problems such as high bit error rates, frequent route changes,
multipath routing and temporary network partitions. The throughput of TCP over
such connection is not satisfactory, because TCP misinterprets the packet loss
or delay as congestion and invokes congestion control and avoidance algorithm.
In this research, the performance of TCP in Adhoc mobile network with high Bit
Error rate (BER) and mobility is studied and investigated. Simulation model is
implemented and experiments are performed using the Network Simulatior 2 (NS2).

Management because the cost of inventories in a supply chain accounts for about

eventually gets enhanced once the efficient and effective management of
inventory is carried out all through the supply chain. The precise estimation
of optimal inventory is essential since shortage of inventory yields to lost
sales, while excess of inventory may result in pointless storage costs. Thus
the determination of the inventory to be held at various levels in a supply
chain becomes inevitable so as to ensure minimal cost for the supply chain. The
minimization of the total supply chain cost can only be achieved when
optimization of the base stock level is carried out at each member of the
supply chain. This paper deals with the problem of determination of base stock
levels in a ten member serial supply chain with multiple products produced by
factories using Uniform Crossover Genetic Algorithms. The complexity of the
problem increases when more distribution centers and agents and multiple
products were involved. These considerations leading to very complex inventory
management process has been resolved in this work.

investment in inventories is enormous, and the management of inventory is
crucial to avoid shortages or delivery delays for the customers and serious
drain on a companys financial resources. The supply chain cost increases
because of the influence of lead times for supplying the stocks as well as the
raw materials. Practically, the lead times will not be same through out all the
periods. Maintaining abundant stocks in order to avoid the impact of high lead
time increases the holding cost. Similarly, maintaining fewer stocks because of
ballpark lead time may lead to shortage of stocks. This also happens in the
case of lead time involved in supplying raw materials. A better optimization
methodology that utilizes the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, one of the
best optimization algorithms, is proposed to overcome the impasse in
maintaining the optimal stock levels in each member of the supply chain. Taking
into account the stock levels thus obtained from the proposed methodology, an
appropriate stock levels to be maintained in the approaching periods that will

morphology located off the outer Galactic plane where high-energy emission has
been detected in the X-ray, GeV and TeV gamma-ray bands. Past observations
suggest IC443 has been interacting with surrounding interstellar matter.
Proximity between dense shocked molecular clouds and GeV-TeV gamma-ray emission
regions detected by EGRET, MAGIC and VERITAS suggests an interpretation that
cosmic-ray (CR) particles are accelerated by the SNR. With the high gamma-ray
statistics and broad energy coverage provided by the LAT, we accurately
characterize the gamma-ray emission produced by the CRs accelerated at IC443.
The emission region is extended in the energy band with theta_68 = 0.27 deg +/-
0.01 deg (stat) +/- 0.03 deg (sys) for an assumed 2-dimensional Gaussian
profile and overlaps almost completely with the extended source region of
VERITAS. Its centroid is displaced significantly from the known pulsar wind
nebula (PWN) which suggests the PWN is not the major contributor in the present
energy band. The observed spectrum changes its power-law slope continuously and
continues smoothly to the MAGIC and VERITAS data points. The combined gamma-ray

various surface density profiles ($\sigma$), where $\sigma \propto
r^{-\alpha}$. The stability of the mean motion resonances(MMRs) caused by the
convergent migration of the two planets is studied as well. Our results show
that:(1) The gap formation process of Saturn is greatly delayed by the tidal
perturbation of Jupiter. These perturbations cause inward or outward runaway
migration of Saturn, depending on the density profiles on the disk. (2) The
convergent migration rate increases as $\alpha$ increases and the type of MMRs
depends on $\alpha$ as well. When $0<\alpha<1$, the convergent migration speed
of Jupiter and Saturn is relatively slow, thus they are trapped into 2:1 MMR.
When $\alpha>4/3$, Saturn passes through the $2:1$ MMR with Jupiter and is
captured into the $3:2$ MMR. (3) The $3:2$ MMR turns out to be unstable when
the eccentricity of Saturn ($e_s$) increases too high. The critical value above
which instability will set in is $e_s \sim 0.15$. We also observe that the two

is reviewed. High momentum partons produced in hard collisions produce a shower
of gluons prior to undergoing the non-perturbative process of hadronization. In
the presence of a dense medium this shower is modified due to scattering of the
various partons off the constituents in the medium. The modified pattern of the
final detected hadrons is then a probe of the structure of the medium as
perceived by the jet. Starting from the factorization paradigm developed for
the case of particle collisions, we review the basic underlying theory of
medium induced gluon radiation based on perturbative Quantum Chromo Dynamics
(pQCD) and current experimental results from Deep Inelastic Scattering on large
nuclei and high energy heavy-ion collisions, emphasizing how these results
constrain our understanding of energy loss. This review contains introductions
to the theory of radiative energy loss, elastic energy loss, and the
corresponding experimental observables and issues. We close with a discussion
of important calculations and measurements that need to be carried out to
complete the description of jet modification at high energies at future high

a*<0.49 and a*>-0.59 at the 3 sigma level of confidence. This result takes into
account all sources of observational and model-parameter uncertainties. Despite
the low spin, the intensity and properties of the radio counterpart, both in

line-profile analysis was used in the first attempt to perform mode
identification, which revealed that non-radial modes are observable. Despite
the fact that the presence of non-radial modes could be confirmed, the degree
or azimuthal order could not be uniquely identified. Here we present an
improvement to this first spectroscopic line-profile analysis. Aims: We aim to
study line-profile variations of stochastically excited solar-like oscillations
in four evolved stars to derive the azimuthal order of the observed mode and
the surface rotational frequency. Methods: Spectroscopic line-profile analysis
is applied to cross-correlation functions, using the Fourier Parameter Fit
method on the amplitude and phase distributions across the profiles. Results:
For four evolved stars, beta Hydri (G2IV), epsilon Ophiuchi (G9.5III), eta
Serpentis (K0III) and delta Eridani (K0IV) the line-profile variations reveal
the azimuthal order of the oscillations with an accuracy of ~1. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals the projected rotational velocity and the inclination
angle. From these parameters we obtain the surface rotational frequency.
Conclusions: We conclude that line-profile variations of cross-correlation
functions behave differently for different frequencies and that they provide
additional information in terms of the surface rotational frequency and
azimuthal order.

polarization is used to determine the full three-dimensional magnetic field
structure around Cepheus A HW2. The observations suggest that the masers probe
the large scale magnetic field and not isolated pockets of a compressed field.
We find that the magnetic field is predominantly aligned along the protostellar

three-dimensional magnetic field orientation and measurements of the magnetic
field strength along the line of sight, we are able to determine that the high
density material, in which the masers occurs, is threaded by a large scale
magnetic field of ~23 mG. This indicates that the protostellar environment at
~1000 AU from Cepheus A HW2 is slightly supercritical (lambda approximately
1.7) and the relation between density and magnetic field is consistent with
collapse along the magnetic field lines. Thus, the observations indicate that
the magnetic field likely regulates accretion onto the disc. The magnetic field
dominates the turbulent energies by approximately a factor of three and is
sufficiently strong to be the crucial component stabilizing the massive
accretion disc and sustaining the high accretion rates needed during massive
star-formation.

and perhaps necessary role in shaping post-Asymptotic Giant Branch and
Planetary Nebula outflows. During post-main-sequence evolution, radial
expansion of the primary star, accompanied by intense winds, can significantly
alter the binary orbit via tidal dissipation and mass loss. To investigate
this, we couple stellar evolution models (from the zero-age main-sequence
through the end of the post-main sequence) to a tidal evolution code. The
binary's fate is determined by the initial masses of the primary and the
companion, the initial orbit (taken to be circular), and the Reimers mass-loss
parameter. For a range of these parameters, we determine whether the orbit
expands due to mass loss or decays due to tidal torques. Where a common
envelope (CE) phase ensues, we estimate the final orbital separation based on
the energy required to unbind the envelope. These calculations predict period
gaps for planetary and brown dwarf companions to white dwarfs. The upper end of
the gap is the shortest period at which a CE phase is avoided. The lower end is
the longest period at which companions survive their CE phase. For binary
systems with 1 $M_\odot$ progenitors, we predict no Jupiter-mass companions
with periods $\lesssim$270 days. Once engulfed, Jupiter-mass companions do not
survive a CE phase. For binary systems consisting of a 1 $M_\odot$ progenitor
with a companion 10 times the mass of Jupiter, we predict a period gap between
$\sim$0.1 and $\sim$380 days. These results are consistent with both the
detection of a $\sim$50 $M_{\rm J}$ brown dwarf in a $\sim$0.003 AU ($\sim$0.08
day) orbit around the white dwarf WD 0137-349 and the tentative detection of a

two methods: subtracting an elliptical beta model fitted to the X-ray surface
brightness, and performing unsharp masking. 13 groups in the sample 25% are
identified as clearly containing cavities, with another 13 systems showing
tentative evidence for such structures. We find tight correlations between the
radial and tangential radii of the cavities, and between their size and
projected distance from the group center, in quantitative agreement with the
case for more massive clusters. This suggests that similar physical processes
are responsible for cavity evolution and disruption in systems covering a large
range in total mass. We see no clear association between the detection of
cavities and the current 1.4 GHz radio luminosity of the central brightest
group galaxy, but there is a clear tendency for systems with a cool core to be
more likely to harbor detectable cavities. To test the efficiency of the
adopted cavity detection procedures, we employ a set of mock images designed to
mimic typical Chandra data of our sample, and find that the model-fitting
approach is generally more reliable than unsharp masking for recovering cavity
properties. Finally, we find that the detectability of cavities is strongly
influenced by a few factors, particularly the signal-to-noise ratio of the
data, and that the real fraction of X-ray groups with prominent cavities could
be substantially larger than the 25--50% suggested by our analysis.

namely, Bernal (AB) stacking and rhombohedral (ABC) stacking. The observed
absorption features, reflecting the underlying symmetry of the two polytypes
and the nature of the associated van Hone singularities, were reproduced by
explicit calculations within a tight-binding model. The findings demonstrate
the pronounced effect of stacking order on the electronic structure of FLG.

to conjecture that the coupling among the modes has a weak influence in our

be obtained a one dimensional harmonic equation which indeed describes with
good accuracy the gravitational response from the Kerr black hole with low

development of the Pleiades. This study builds on our previous one that
established statistically the present-day structure of this system. Our
simulation begins just after molecular cloud gas has been expelled by the
embedded stars. We then follow, using an N body code, the stellar dynamical
evolution of the cluster to the present and beyond. Our initial state is that
which evolves, over the 125 Myr age of the cluster, to a configuration most
closely matching the current one.
  We find that the original cluster, newly stripped of gas, already had a
virial radius of 4 pc. This configuration was larger than most observed,
embedded clusters. Over time, the cluster expanded further and the central
surface density fell by about a factor of two. We attribute both effects to the
liberation of energy from tightening binaries of short period. Indeed, the
original binary fraction was close to unity. The ancient Pleiades also had
significant mass segregation, which persists in the cluster today.
  In the future, the central density of the Pleiades will continue to fall. For
the first few hundred Myr, the cluster as a whole will expand because of
dynamical heating by binaries. The expansion process is aided by mass loss
through stellar evolution, which weakens the system's gravitational binding. At
later times, the Galactic tidal field begins to heavily deplete the cluster
mass. It is believed that most open clusters are eventually destroyed by close
passage of a giant molecular cloud. Barring that eventuality, the density
falloff will continue for as long as 1 Gyr, by which time most of the cluster
mass will have been tidally stripped away by the Galactic field.

Dark Stars, powered by dark matter heating rather than by nuclear fusion.
Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, which may be their own antipartners,
collect inside the first stars and annihilate to produce a heat source that can
power the stars for millions to billions of years. In this paper we show that
these objects can grow to be supermassive dark stars (SMDS) with masses
$\gtrsim (10^5-10^7) \msun$. The growth continues as long as dark matter
heating persists, since dark stars are large and cool (surface temperature
$\lesssim 5\times 10^4$K) and do not emit enough ionizing photons to prevent
further accretion of baryons onto the star. The dark matter may be provided by
two mechanisms: (1) gravitational attraction of dark matter particles on a
variety of orbits not previously considered, and (2) capture of WIMPs due to
elastic scattering. Once the dark matter fuel is exhausted, the SMDS becomes a
heavy main sequence star; these stars eventually collapse to form massive black
holes that may provide seeds for supermassive black holes in the Universe. SMDS
are very bright, with luminosities exceeding $(10^9-10^{11}) L_\odot$. We
demonstrate that for several reasonable parameters, these objects will be
detectable with JWST. Such an observational discovery would confirm the
existence of a new phase of stellar evolution powered by dark matter.

micrometric terminal plate coated with secretory fluid. It was recently shown
that the layer of the pad secretion covering the terminal plates is responsible
for the generation of strong attractive forces. However, less is known about
the fluid itself because it is produced in extremely small quantity. We here
present a first experimental investigation of the rheological properties of the
pad secretion in the Colorado potato beetle {\it Leptinotarsa decemlineata}.
Because the secretion is produced in an extremely small amount at the level of
the terminal plate, we first develop a procedure based on capillary effects to
collect the secretion. We then manage to incorporate micrometric beads,
initially in the form of a dry powder, and record their thermal motion to
determine the mechanical properties of the surrounding medium. We achieve such
a quantitative measurement within the collected volume, much smaller than the
$1 {\rm \mu}$l sample volume usually required for this technique. Surprisingly,
the beetle secretion was found to behave as a purely viscous liquid, of high
viscosity. This suggests that no specific complex fluid behaviour is needed
during beetle locomotion. We build a scenario for the contact formation between
the spatula at the setal tip and a substrate, during the insect walk. We show
that the attachment dynamics of the insect pad computed from the high measured
viscosity is in good agreement with observed insect pace. We finally discuss
the consequences of the secretion viscosity on the insect adhesion.

on dark matter particle properties. In particular for leptonic annihilation
final states and particle masses greater than ~200 GeV, gamma-ray emission from
inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons is expected to dominate the dark
matter annihilation signal from clusters, and our gamma-ray limits exclude
large regions of the parameter space that would give a good fit to the recent
anomalous Pamela and Fermi-LAT electron-positron measurements. We also present
constraints on the annihilation of more standard dark matter candidates, such
as the lightest neutralino of supersymmetric models. The constraints are
particularly strong when including the fact that clusters are known to contain
substructure at least on galaxy scales, increasing the expected gamma-ray flux
by a factor of ~5 over a smooth-halo assumption. We also explore the effect of
uncertainties in cluster dark matter density profiles, finding a systematic
uncertainty in the constraints of roughly a factor of two, but similar overall

strategy. Namely, the items can be grouped together in pools, and a single
measurement would reveal whether there are one or more defectives in the pool.
The threshold model is a generalization of this idea where a measurement
returns positive if the number of defectives in the pool reaches a fixed
threshold $u > 0$, negative if this number is no more than a fixed lower
threshold $\ell < u$, and may behave arbitrarily otherwise. We study
non-adaptive threshold group testing (in a possibly noisy setting) and show
that, for this problem, $O(d^{g+2} (\log d) \log(n/d))$ measurements (where $g
:= u-\ell-1$ and $u$ is any fixed constant) suffice to identify the defectives,
and also present almost matching lower bounds. This significantly improves the
previously known (non-constructive) upper bound $O(d^{u+1} \log(n/d))$.
Moreover, we obtain a framework for explicit construction of measurement
schemes using lossless condensers. The number of measurements resulting from
this scheme is ideally bounded by $O(d^{g+3} (\log d) \log n)$. Using
state-of-the-art constructions of lossless condensers, however, we obtain
explicit testing schemes with $O(d^{g+3} (\log d) qpoly(\log n))$ and
$O(d^{g+3+\beta} poly(\log n))$ measurements, for arbitrary constant $\beta >

pressure-dependent evolution of the lattice parameters indicates a slightly
anisotropic compression of the unit cell, which results in a decrease in the
lattice c/a ratio with increasing pressure. From compression data, the bulk
modulus is estimated to be B_0~190 GPa. While the unit cell volume undergoes
compression, the Ru-Si layers separating the U planes evince an apparent
""flattening,"" resulting in a more 2D-like structure and an increased volume per
U ion.

organisms may indeed be employing near optimal Bayesian calculations in their
decision-making. An intriguing question relates to the properties of optimal
encoding methods, namely determining the properties of neural populations in
sensory layers that optimize performance, subject to physiological constraints.
Within an ecological theory of neural encoding/decoding, we show that optimal
Bayesian performance requires neural adaptation which reflects environmental
changes. Specifically, we predict that neuronal tuning functions possess an
optimal width, which increases with prior uncertainty and environmental noise,
and decreases with the decoding time window. Furthermore, even for static
stimuli, we demonstrate that dynamic sensory tuning functions, acting at
relatively short time scales, lead to improved performance. Interestingly, the
narrowing of tuning functions as a function of time was recently observed in
several biological systems. Such results set the stage for a functional theory
which may explain the high reliability of sensory systems, and the utility of
neuronal adaptation occurring at multiple time scales.

out with the IRC.
  The extended structure associated with a Halpha filament appears bright at 7
micron, suggesting that the filament is bright at the UIR band emission.
Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the IRC confirm the presence of 6.2,
7.7, and 11.3 micron emission in the filament. The filament spectrum exhibits
strong 11.3 micron UIR band emission relative to the 7.7 micron band compared
to the galaxy disk observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on Spitzer. The
near-infrared spectrum also suggests the presence of excess continuum emission
in 2.5--5 micron in the filament.
  The Halpha filament is thought to have been formed by the galactic outflow
originating from the star-formation activity in the disk of NGC1569. The
destruction timescale of the UIR band carriers in the outflow is estimated to
be much shorter (~ 1.3 x 10^3 yr) than the timescale of the outflow (~ 5.3
Myr). Thus it is unlikely that the band carriers survive the outflow
environment. Alternatively, we suggest that the band carriers in the filaments
may be produced by the fragmentation of large carbonaceous grains in shocks,
which produces the Halpha emission. The NIR excess continuum emission cannot be
accounted for by free-free emission alone and a hot dust contribution may be
needed, although the free-free emission intensity estimated from HI
recombination lines has a large uncertainty.

applied macroscopic strain, and exhibits anisotropic kinetics with one of the
three equivalent back-bonds of on-axis samples reacting differently from the
other two. Anisotropic oxidation kinetics also leads to observed transient
changes in bond directions. By comparing results for surfaces strained in

correlation between the vulnerability measures for individual simulations. We
conclude that evaluating vulnerability in power networks using purely

interaction of the shell with a molecular cloud. The shell emits intense radio
synchrotron photons, and high-energy gamma-rays from the remnant have been
detected using the {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT), the H.E.S.S.

approach to the nonlinear shock acceleration process, we investigate the
multiband nonthermal emission from W51C. The result shows that the radio
emission from the remnant can be explained as synchrotron radiation of the
electrons accelerated by a part of the shock flowing into the ambient medium.
On the other hand, the high-energy gamma-rays detected by the {\it Fermi} LAT
are mainly produced via proton-proton collisions of the high-energy protons
with the ambient matter in the molecular cloud overtaken by the other part of
the shock. We propose a possible explanation of the multiband nonthermal

properties of thermal plumes in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection using
the thermochromic-liquid-crystal (TLC) technique. The experiments were
performed in three water-filled cylindrical convection cells with aspect ratios
2, 1, and 0.5 and over the Rayleigh-number range $5\times10^7 \leq Ra \leq
10^{11}$. TLC thermal images of horizontal plane cuts at various depths below
the top plate were acquired. Three-dimensional images of thermal plumes were
then reconstructed from the two-dimensional slices of the temperature field.
The results show that the often-called sheetlike plumes are really
one-dimensional structures and may be called rodlike plumes. We find that the
number densities for both sheetlike/rodlike and mushroomlike plumes have
power-law dependence on $Ra$ with scaling exponents of $\sim 0.3$, which is
close to that between the Nusselt number $Nu$ and $Ra$. This result suggests
that it is the plume number that primarily d ermines the scaling exponent of
the $Nu$-$Ra$ scaling relation. The evolution of the aspect ratio of
sheetlike/rodlike plumes reveals that as $Ra$ increases the plume geometry
changes from more-elongated to less-elongated. Our study of the plume area
fraction (fraction of coverage over the surface of the plate) further reveals
that the increased plume numbers with $Ra$ mainly comes from increased plume
emission, rather than fragmentation of plumes. In addition, the area,
perimeter, and the shape complexity of the two-dimensional horizontal cuts of
sheetlike/rodlike plumes were studied and all are found to obey log-normal
distributions.

challenge. There are three ways to alleviate the problem: debris mitigation,
debris removal and collision avoidance. This paper addresses collision
avoidance, by describing a method that contributes to achieving a requisite
increase in orbit prediction accuracy. Batch least-squares differential
correction is applied to the publicly available two-line element (TLE) catalog
of space objects. Using a high-precision numerical propagator, we fit an orbit
to state vectors derived from successive TLEs. We then propagate the fitted
orbit further forward in time. These predictions are compared to precision
ephemeris data derived from the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) for
several satellites, including objects in the congested sun-synchronous orbital
region. The method leads to a predicted range error that increases at a typical
rate of 100 meters per day, approximately a 10-fold improvement over TLE's
propagated with their associated analytic propagator (SGP4). Corresponding
improvements for debris trajectories could potentially provide initial
conjunction analysis sufficiently accurate for an operationally viable
collision avoidance system.
  We discuss additional optimization and the computational requirements for
applying all-on-all conjunction analysis to the whole TLE catalog, present and
near future. Finally, we outline a scheme for debris-debris collision avoidance
that may become practicable given these developments.

Moreover, PE generalizes the well-known Pairwise Averaging and Randomized

operation over finite fields, namely linear operator channels (LOCs), are
studied in this paper. For such a channel, its output vector is a linear
transform of its input vector, and the transformation matrix is randomly and
independently generated. The transformation matrix is assumed to remain
constant for every T input vectors and to be unknown to both the transmitter
and the receiver. There are NO constraints on the distribution of the
transformation matrix and the field size.
  Specifically, the optimality of subspace coding over LOCs is investigated. A
lower bound on the maximum achievable rate of subspace coding is obtained and
it is shown to be tight for some cases. The maximum achievable rate of
constant-dimensional subspace coding is characterized and the loss of rate
incurred by using constant-dimensional subspace coding is insignificant.
  The maximum achievable rate of channel training is close to the lower bound
on the maximum achievable rate of subspace coding. Two coding approaches based
on channel training are proposed and their performances are evaluated. Our
first approach makes use of rank-metric codes and its optimality depends on the
existence of maximum rank distance codes. Our second approach applies linear
coding and it can achieve the maximum achievable rate of channel training. Our
code designs require only the knowledge of the expectation of the rank of the
transformation matrix. The second scheme can also be realized ratelessly
without a priori knowledge of the channel statistics.

best described by two MEKAL plasma emission models with temperatures at

bimodality: brighter galaxies, including the discy ones, exhibit significantly
younger ages than fainter dEs. Therefore, it appears less likely that fainter
and brighter dEs have experienced the same evolutionary history, as the
well-established trend of decreasing average stellar age when going from the
most luminous ellipticals towards low-luminosity Es and bright dEs is broken
here. The older and more metal-poor dEs could have had an early termination of
star formation activity, possibly being ""primordial"" galaxies in the sense that
they have formed along with the protocluster or experienced very early infall.

two questions with broad astrophysical implications: Can accreting white dwarfs
be pushed towards the Chandrasekhar mass limit to yield type Ia supernovae? Are
Ultra-luminous red variables a new kind of astrophysical phenomenon, or merely
extreme classical novae? We review the methods used to determine nova ejecta
masses. Except for the unique case of BT Mon (nova 1939), all nova ejecta mass
determinations depend on untested assumptions and multi-parameter modeling. The
remarkably simple assumption of equipartition between kinetic and radiated
energy (E_kin and E_rad, respectively) in nova ejecta has been invoked as a way
around this conundrum for the ultra-luminous red variable in M31. The deduced
mass is far larger than that produced by any classical nova model. Our nova
eruption simulations show that radiation and kinetic energy in nova ejecta are
very far from being in energy equipartition, with variations of four orders of
magnitude in the ratio E_kin/E_rad being commonplace. The assumption of
equipartition must not be used to deduce nova ejecta masses; any such
""determinations"" can be overestimates by a factor of up to 10,000. We
data-mined our extensive series of nova simulations to search for correlations
that could yield nova ejecta masses. Remarkably, the mass ejected during a nova
eruption is dependent only on (and is directly proportional to) E_rad. If we
measure the distance to an erupting nova and its bolometric light curve then
E_rad and hence the mass ejected can be directly measured.

Special attention is focused on the recombination (self-healing) of broken

an optical dipole trap. The time-of-flight expansion of the atomic spatial
density distribution is observed by accumulating many single atom images. The
position of the atom is revealed with a spatial resolution close to 1
micrometer by a single photon event, induced by a short resonant probe. The
expansion yields a measure of the temperature of a single atom, which is in
very good agreement with the value obtained by an independent measurement based
on a release-and-recapture method. The analysis presented in this paper
provides a way of calibrating an imaging system useful for experimental studies
involving a few atoms confined in a dipole trap.

information on the Galactic magnetic field. The diffuse polarized emission is
strongly influenced by Faraday rotation in the magneto-ionic medium and
rotation measure is the prime quantity of interest, implying that all Stokes
parameters must be measured over wide frequency bands with many frequency
channels. The DRAO 26-m Telescope has been equipped with a wideband feed, a
polarization transducer to deliver both hands of circular polarization, and a
receiver, all operating from 1277 to 1762 MHz. Half-power beamwidth is between
40 and 30 arcminutes. A digital FPGA spectrometer, based on commercially
available components, produces all Stokes parameters in 2048 frequency channels
over a 485-MHz bandwidth. Signals are digitized to 8 bits and a Fast Fourier
Transform is applied to each data stream. Stokes parameters are then generated
in each frequency channel. This instrument is in use at DRAO for a Northern sky
polarization survey. Observations consist of scans up and down the Meridian at
a drive rate of 0.9 degree per minute to give complete coverage of the sky
between declinations -30 degree and 90 degree. This paper presents a complete
description of the receiver and data acquisition system. Only a small fraction
of the frequency band of operation is allocated for radio astronomy, and about
20 percent of the data are lost to interference. The first 8 percent of data
from the survey are used for a proof-of-concept study, which has led to the
first application of Rotation Measure Synthesis to the diffuse Galactic
emission obtained with a single-antenna telescope. We find rotation measure
values for the diffuse emission as high as approximately 100 rad per square
metre, much higher than recorded in earlier work.

martingales have an extra property of being orthogonal martingales? This
property is an analog (for martingales) of the Cauchy-Riemann equation for
functions, and it naturally appears from a problem on singular integrals (see
the references at the end of Section~1). We establish here that in this case
the constant is quite different. Actually, $\E|W|^p\le
(\frac{1+z_p}{1-z_p})^p\E|Z|^p$, $p\ge 2$, where $z_p$ is a specific zero of a
certain solution of a Legendre ODE. We also prove the sharpness of this
estimate. Asymptotically, $(1+z_p)/(1-z_p)=(4j^{-2}_0+o(1))p$, $p\to\infty$,

rates of neutrino detection at SK and SNO for various theta_{13} values and
both normal and inverted hierarchies. The predicted event rates of bar{nu}_e
and nu_e depend on the mixing angle theta_{13} for the inverted and normal
hierarchies, respectively, and the influence of the shock appears for about 2 -
8 s when sin^2 2 theta_{13} is larger than 10^{-3}. These neutrino signals for
the shock propagation is decreased by < 30 % for bar{nu}_e in inverted (SK) or
by < 15 % for nu_e in normal hierarchy (SNO) compared with the case without
shock. The obtained ratio of the total event for high-energy neutrinos (20 MeV
< E_{nu} < 60 MeV) to low-energy neutrinos (5 MeV < E_{nu} < 20 MeV) is
consistent with the previous studies in schematic semi-analytic or other
hydrodynamic models of the shock propagation. The time dependence of the
calculated ratio of the event rates of high-energy to low-energy neutrinos is a
very useful observable which is sensitive to theta_{13} and hierarchies.
Namely, time-dependent ratio shows clearer signal of the shock propagation that
exhibits remarkable decrease by at most factor \sim 2 for bar{nu}_e in inverted
(SK), whereas it exhibits smaller change by \sim 10 % for nu_e in normal
hierarchy (SNO). Observing time-dependent high-energy to low-energy ratio of
the neutrino events thus would provide a piece of very useful information to
constrain theta_{13} and mass hierarchy, and eventually help understanding the
propagation how the shock wave propagates inside the star.

components of the magnetic field lambda(Bxyz) and of the velocity lambda(Vyz)
do not show this change and have similar values, indicating a continual
turbulent correlation length of around 1.4 x 10^6 km. We conclude that a linear
relation between lambda(|B|), VB^2 and Kp suggests that the former is related
to the total magnetic energy in the solar wind and an estimate of the average
size of geo-effective structures which is in turn proportional to VB^2. By
looking at the distribution of daily correlation lengths we show that the solar

to the fluctuation stage, when the dots are not yet noticeably correlated with
each other. The second is the quantum stage, when the dot interactions through
the common radiation field become more important, but the coherence is not yet
developed. The third is the coherent stage, when the dots radiate coherently,
emitting a superradiant pulse. After the superradiant pulse, the system of dots
relaxes to an incoherent state in the relaxation stage. If there is no external
permanent pumping, or the effective dot interactions are weak, the system tends
to a stationary state during the last stationary stage, when coherence dies out
to a low, practically negligible, level. In the case of permanent pumping,

describing core processes on geomagnetic secular variation timescales. It
extends the formalism of Alfv\'en torsional oscillations by incorporating
non-zonal motions. Within this framework, the magnetohydrodynamics takes place
in the equatorial plane; it involves quadratic magnetic quantities, which are
averaged along the direction of rotation of the Earth. In addition, the
equatorial flow is projected on the core-mantle boundary. It interacts with the
magnetic field at the core surface, through the radial component of the
magnetic induction equation. That part of the model connects the dynamics and
the observed secular variation, with the radial component of the magnetic field
acting as a passive tracer. We resort to variational data assimilation to
construct formally the relationship between model predictions and observations.
Variational data assimilation seeks to minimize an objective function, by
computing its sensitivity to its control variables. The sensitivity is
efficiently calculated after integration of the adjoint model. We illustrate
that framework with twin experiments, performed first in the case of the
kinematic core flow inverse problem, and then in the case of Alfv\'en torsional
oscillations. In both cases, using the adjoint model allows us to retrieve core
state variables which, while taking part in the dynamics, are not directly
sampled at the core surface. We study the effect of several factors on the
solution (width of the assimilation time window, amount and quality of data),
and we discuss the potential of the model to deal with real geomagnetic
observations.

detected at 153 and 240 MHz while it is not detected at 610 MHz. The most
prominent feature at low frequencies is a patch of diffuse steep spectrum
emission located at about 5' south-east from the cluster center. By combining
these images with that at 1477 MHz, we derived the spectral index of the

alpha_240^153 ~1.4 +/- 0.3 and an high-frequency spectral index of
alpha_1477^240 ~ 1.60 +/- 0.05. Moreover, we measure a systematic increase of
the high-frequency spectral index with radius: the azimuthal radial average of
alpha_1477^240 increases from about 1.3, at the cluster center, up to about 2.0
in the mini-halo outskirts. The observed radio spectral index is in agreement
with that obtained by modeling the non-thermal hard X-ray emission in this

Compton scattering between the photons of the cosmic microwave background and a
population of non-thermal electrons which are isotropically distributed and
whose energy spectrum is a power law with index p. We derive that the electrons

  We study the atmosphere's response to nonlinear ""Wind Induced Surface Heat

atmospheric model. The model produces an interestingly rich interannual
behavior including a slow, eastward propagating equatorial westerly multiscale
signal, not consistent with any free linear waves, and with MJO-like

forced by WISHE due to the meridional wind induced by a Yanai wave group. The
forced Kelvin wave has a velocity similar to the group velocity of the Yanai
waves, allowing the two to interact nonlinearly via the WISHE term while slowly
propagating eastward. These results may have implications for observed tropical
WISHE-related atmospheric intraseasonal phenomena.

Internet giants. The increased number of specialized websites and modern
profiling techniques, have all contributed to an explosion of the income of ad
brokers from online advertising. The single biggest threat to this growth, is
however, click-fraud. Trained botnets and even individuals are hired by
click-fraud specialists in order to maximize the revenue of certain users from
the ads they publish on their websites, or to launch an attack between
competing businesses.
  In this note we wish to raise the awareness of the networking research
community on potential research areas within this emerging field. As an example
strategy, we present Bluff ads; a class of ads that join forces in order to
increase the effort level for click-fraud spammers. Bluff ads are either
targeted ads, with irrelevant display text, or highly relevant display text,
with irrelevant targeting information. They act as a litmus test for the
legitimacy of the individual clicking on the ads. Together with standard
threshold-based methods, fake ads help to decrease click-fraud levels.

existence and uniqueness of multi-solitons. Recall that for any N given
solitons, we call multi-soliton a solution of (gKdV) which behaves as the sum
of these N solitons asymptotically as time goes to infinity. More recently, for
the L^2 supercritical case, Cote, Martel and Merle proved the existence of at
least one multi-soliton. In the present paper, as suggested by a previous work
concerning the one soliton case, we first construct an N-parameter family of
multi-solitons for the supercritical (gKdV) equation, for N arbitrarily given
solitons, and then prove that any multi-soliton belongs to this family. In
other words, we obtain a complete classification of multi-solitons for (gKdV).

and ac Stark shifts in two-photon transitions of antiprotonic helium atoms

sub-Doppler spectroscopy is in principle possible by exciting transitions of
the type (n,L)->(n-2,L-2) between antiprotonic states of principal and angular
momentum quantum numbers n~L-1~35, first by using highly monochromatic,
nanosecond laser beams of intensities 10^4-10^5 W/cm^2, and then by tuning the
virtual intermediate state close (e.g., within 10-20 GHz) to the real state
(n-1,L-1) to enhance the nonlinear transition probability. We expect that ac
Stark shifts of a few MHz or more will become an important source of systematic
error at fractional precisions of better than a few parts in 10^9. These shifts
can in principle be minimized and even canceled by selecting an optimum
combination of laser intensities and frequencies. We simulated the resonance
profiles of some two-photon transitions in the regions n=30-40 of the
\bar{p}^4He^+ and \bar{p} ^3He^+ isotopes to find the best conditions that
would allow this.

distributions of gravitationally unstable cores by postprocessing data from
simulations of non-selfgravitating isothermal supersonic turbulence with
varying resolution. In one set of simulations solenoidal forcing is applied,
while the second set uses purely compressive forcing to excite turbulent
motions. From the resulting density field, we compute the mass distribution of
gravitationally unstable cores by means of a clump-finding algorithm. Using the
time-averaged probability density functions of the mass density, semi-analytic
mass distributions are calculated from analytical theories. We apply stability
criteria that are based on the Bonnor-Ebert mass resulting from the thermal
pressure and from the sum of thermal and turbulent pressure. Although there are
uncertainties in the application of the clump-finding algorithm, we find
systematic differences in the mass distributions obtained from solenoidal and
compressive forcing. Compressive forcing produces a shallower slope in the
high-mass power-law regime compared to solenoidal forcing. The mass
distributions also depend on the Jeans length resulting from the choice of the
mass in the computational box, which is freely scalable for non-selfgravitating
isothermal turbulence. Provided that all cores are numerically resolved and
most cores are small compared to the length scale of the forcing, the
normalised core mass distributions are found to be close to the semi-analytic
models. Especially for the high-mass tails, the Hennebelle-Chabrier theory
implies that the additional support due to turbulent pressure is important.

fluxes need to be corrected for the changes of effective rest-frame wavelengths
of filter bandpasses, called K-corrections. Usual approaches to compute them
are based on the template fitting of observed spectral energy distributions
(SED) and, thus, require multi-colour photometry. Here, we demonstrate that, in
cases of widely used optical and near-infrared filters, K-corrections can be
precisely approximated as two-dimensional low-order polynomials of only two
parameters: redshift and one observed colour. With this minimalist approach, we
present the polynomial fitting functions for K-corrections in SDSS ugriz, UKIRT
WFCAM YJHK, Johnson-Cousins UBVR_cI_c, and 2MASS JHK_s bands for galaxies at
redshifts Z<0.5 based on empirically-computed values obtained by fitting
combined optical-NIR SEDs of a set of 10^5 galaxies constructed from SDSS DR7
and UKIDSS DR5 photometry using the Virtual Observatory. For luminous red
galaxies we provide K-corrections as functions of their redshifts only. In two
filters, g and r, we validate our solutions by computing K-corrections directly
from SDSS DR7 spectra. We also present a K-corrections calculator, a web-based

predicts two neutral and four charged extra gauge bosons, Z_{1,2} and W_{1,2}.
The model represents an extension of the minimal three site version (or BESS
model), largely investigated in the literature, which includes three heavy
vector bosons. We compute the properties of the new particles, and derive
indirect and direct limits on their masses and couplings from LEP and Tevatron
data and from the perturbative unitarity requirements. In contrast to other
Higgsless models characterized by fermiophobic extra gauge bosons, here
sizeable fermion-boson couplings are allowed by the electroweak precision data.
The prospects of detecting the new predicted particles in the favoured
Drell-Yan channel at the LHC are thus investigated. The outcome is that all six
extra gauge bosons could be discovered in the early stage of the LHC

many Class 0 protostars exhibit complex, irregular, and non-axisymmetric
structure within their dusty envelopes. Our 8 $\mu$m extinction maps probe some
of the densest regions in these protostellar envelopes. Many of the systems are
observed to have highly irregular and non-axisymmetric morphologies on scales
>= 1000 AU, with a quarter of the sample exhibiting filamentary or flattened
dense structures. Complex envelope structure is observed in regions spatially
distinct from outflow cavities, and the densest structures often show no
systematic alignment perpendicular to the cavities. These results indicate that
mass ejection is not responsible for much of the irregular morphologies we
detect; rather, we suggest that the observed envelope complexity is mostly the
result of collapse from protostellar cores with initially non-equilibrium
structures. The striking non-axisymmetry in many envelopes could provide
favorable conditions for the formation of binary systems. We also note that
protostars in the sample appear to be formed preferentially near the edges of
clouds or bends in filaments, suggesting formation by gravitational focusing.

direction of the Galactic Centre up to energies E>10 TeV. Up to now, the origin
of this emission is unknown due to the limited positional accuracy of the
observing instruments. One of the counterpart candidates is the super-massive
black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. If the VHE emission is produced within ~10^{15} cm
~1000 r_G (r_G=G M/c^2 is the Schwarzschild radius) of the SMBH, a decrease of
the VHE photon flux in the energy range 100--300 GeV is expected whenever an
early type or giant star approaches the line of sight within ~ milli-arcseconds
(mas). The dimming of the flux is due to absorption by pair-production of the
VHE photons in the soft photon field of the star, an effect we refer to as
pair-production eclipse (PPE). Based upon the currently known orbits of stars
in the inner arcsecond of the Galaxy we find that PPEs lead to a systematic
dimming in the 100--300 GeV band at the level of a few per cent and lasts for
several weeks. Since the PPE affects only a narrow energy band and is well
correlated with the passage of the star, it can be clearly discriminated
against other systematic or even source-intrinsic effects. While the effect is
too small to be observable with the current generation of VHE detectors,
upcoming high count-rate experiments like the Cherenkov telescope array (CTA)
will be sufficiently sensitive. Measuring the temporal signature of the PPE
bears the potential to locate the position and size of the VHE emitting region
within the inner 1000 r_G or in the case of a non-detection exclude the
immediate environment of the SMBH as the site of gamma-ray production
altogether.
