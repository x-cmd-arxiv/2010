difference between the gravitino and the lightest MSSM particle is much smaller
than the gravitino mass itself. In this case, the energy released in the decay
of the next to lightest sypersymmetric particle (NLSP) is reduced. Consequently
the cosmological and astrophysical constraints on the gravitino abundance, and
hence on the reheating temperature, become softer than in the usual case. On
the other hand, such small mass splittings generically imply a much longer
lifetime for the NLSP. We find that, in the constrained MSSM (CMSSM), for
neutralino LSP or NLSP, reheating temperatures compatible with thermal
leptogenesis are reached for small splittings of order 10^{-2} GeV. While for
stau NLSP, temperatures of 4x10^9 GeV can be obtained even for splittings of
order of tens of GeVs. This ""degenerate gravitino"" scenario offers a possible
way out to the gravitino problem for thermal leptogenesis in supersymmetric
theories.

oscillations in a two-dimensional coronal arcade by including the
three-dimensional propagation of perturbations. The time evolution of
impulsively generated perturbations is studied by solving the linear, ideal
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the zero-beta approximation. As we
neglect gas pressure the slow mode is absent and therefore only coupled MHD
fast and Alfven modes remain. Two types of numerical experiments are performed.
First, the resonant wave energy transfer between a fast normal mode of the
system and local Alfven waves is analyzed. It is seen how, because of resonant
coupling, the fast wave with global character transfers its energy to Alfvenic
oscillations localized around a particular magnetic surface within the arcade,
thus producing the damping of the initial fast MHD mode. Second, the time
evolution of a localized impulsive excitation, trying to mimic a nearby coronal
disturbance, is considered. In this case, the generated fast wavefront leaves
its energy on several magnetic surfaces within the arcade. The system is
therefore able to trap energy in the form of Alfvenic oscillations, even in the
absence of a density enhancement such as that of a coronal loop. These local
oscillations are subsequently phase-mixed to smaller spatial scales. The amount
of wave energy trapped by the system via wave energy conversion strongly
depends on the wavelength of perturbations in the perpendicular direction, but
is almost independent from the ratio of the magnetic to density scale heights.

member of the intermediate-mass class of binary pulsar (IMBP) systems. We have
been timing this pulsar since its discovery in 2002. Concentrated observations
at the Green Bank Telescope, augmented with data from the Parkes and Nancay
observatories, have allowed us to determine the general relativistic Shapiro
delay. This has yielded pulsar and white dwarf mass measurements of 1.24(11)

contribute to the relatively small number of known IMBPs.

from integrable pde's with the role of time played by the null coordinate
$\eta$. This is a new result mathematically, since there has not been a
transition matrix for $A$ in the litterature, while physically it presents the
possibility of obtaining integrals of motion (for appropriate boundary
conditions), from the trace of the derivative with respect to the null
coordinate $\eta$, of ${\cal T}$, in terms of classical relativity connections,
since $A(\gamma = \pm 1)$ can be expressed in a simple way in terms of the
classical Christoffel symbols. This may prove of use upon quantization since
connections are fundamental variables of quantum gravity. The roles of $\eta$
and $\varsigma $ may be reversed to obtain integrals of motion for $\varsigma$,
thus $\varsigma$ playing the role of time. This ties well with the two-time
interpretation and approach already established before.

of galaxies with the same luminosity is six times smaller at z=3.2 than at z=0,
and their average angular size for a given luminosity is approximately
proportional to 1/z. Neither the hypothesis that galaxies which formed earlier
have much higher densities nor their luminosity evolution, mergers ratio, or
massive outflows due to a quasar feedback mechanism are enough to justify such
a strong size evolution. Also, at high redshift, the intrinsic ultraviolet
surface brightness would be prohibitively high with this evolution, and the
velocity dispersion much higher than observed. We explore here another
possibility to overcome this problem by considering different cosmological
scenarios that might make the observed angular sizes compatible with a weaker
evolution.
  One of the models explored, a very simple phenomenological extrapolation of
the linear Hubble law in a Euclidean static universe, fits the angular size vs.
redshift dependence quite well, which is also approximately proportional to 1/z
with this cosmological model. There are no free parameters derived ad hoc,
although the error bars allow a slight size/luminosity evolution. The type Ia
supernovae Hubble diagram can also be explained in terms of this model with no
ad hoc fitted parameter.

is just to discuss which theoretical models provide a better fit to the data of

Hence, it is not of Goussarov-Polyak-Viro finite-type. Moreover, every

""even"" part and an ""odd"" part. For the Gaussian parity, neither part of the
formula is of GPV finite-type when it is nonconstant on the set of classical

the solar neighbourhood can produce the so called 'Hercules stream'. Recently,
a second bar may have been identified in the Galactic centre, the so called
'long bar', which is longer and much flatter than the traditional Galactic bar,
and has a similar mass. We looked at the dynamical effects of both bars,
separately and together, on orbits of stars integrated backwards from local
position and velocities, and a model of the Galactic potential which includes
the bars directly. Both bars can produce Hercules like features, and allow us
to measure the rotation rate of the bar(s). We measure a pattern speed, for
both bars, of 1.87 +/- 0.02 times the local circular frequency. This is on par
with previous measurements for the Galactic bar, although we do adopt a
slightly different Solar motion. Finally, we identify a new kinematic feature
in local velocity space, caused by the long bar, which is tempting to identify
with the high velocity 'Arcturus' stream.

from accretion of dark matter from their surrounding haloes. By considering
only the accretion due to dark matter particles on orbits unbound to the
central black hole, we obtain a firm lower limit to the resulting accretion
rate. We find that a runaway accretion regime occurs on a timescale which
depends on the three characteristic parameters of the problem: the initial mass
of the black hole, and the volume density and velocity dispersion of the dark
matter particles in its vicinity. An analytical treatment of the accretion rate
yields results implying that for the largest black hole masses inferred from
QSO studies ($>10^{9} M_{\odot}$), the runaway regime would be reached on time
scales which are shorter than the lifetimes of the haloes in question for
central dark matter densities in excess of $250 M_{\odot}$pc$^{-3}$. Since
reaching runaway accretion would strongly distort the host dark matter halo,
the inferences of QSO black holes in this mass range lead to an upper limit on
the central dark matter densities of their host haloes of $\rho_{0} < 250
M_{\odot} $pc$^{-3}$. This limit scales inversely with the assumed central
black hole mass. However, thinking of dark matter profiles as universal across
galactic populations, as cosmological studies imply, we obtain a firm upper
limit for the central density of dark matter in such structures.

In this manuscript, we propose a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) independent

phylogenetic profiles built using position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs)
are capable of constructing informative evolutionary histories(1;2). In this
manuscript, we theorize that PSSMs derived specifically from the query
sequences used to construct the phylogenetic tree will improve this method for
the study of rapidly evolving proteins. To test this theory, we performed
phylogenetic analyses of a benchmark protein superfamily (reverse
transcriptases (RT)) as well as simulated datasets. When we compare the results
obtained from our method, PHYlogenetic ReconstructioN (PHYRN), with other MSA
dependent methods, we observe that PHYRN provides a 4- to 100-fold increase in
accurate measurements at deep nodes. As phylogenetic profiles are used as the
information source, rather than MSA, we propose PHYRN as a paradigm shift in
studying evolution when MSA approaches fail. Perhaps most importantly, due to
the improvements in our computational approach and the availability of vast
amount of sequencing data, PHYRN is scalable to thousands of sequences. Taken
together with PHYRNs adaptability to any protein family, this method can serve
as a tool for resolving ambiguities in evolutionary studies of rapidly
evolving/highly divergent protein families.

At T = 6 K, the response of the PMT decreases to 51 +- 13 % and 27 +- 6 % when
assessed in photon counting and pulse height mode, respectively. Due to the
light yield increase of the CaWO4 scintillating crystal the overall
responsivity of the scintillation modules CaWO4+PMT is 94 +- 15 % (photon
counting) and 48 +- 8 % (pulse height) when cooling to T = 6 K. The dark count

considering cubic and two kinds of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The magnitude
of cubic and uniaxial anisotropy constants is found to be proportional to the
fourth and second power of saturation magnetization, respectively. Similarly to
the case of (001) samples, the spin reorientation transition from uniaxial
anisotropy with the easy along the [-1, 1, 0] direction at high temperatures to
the biaxial <100> anisotropy at low temperatures is observed around 25 K. The
determined values of the anisotropy constants have been confirmed by FMR
studies. As evidenced by investigations of the polar magnetooptical Kerr
effect, the particular combination of magnetic anisotropies allows the
out-of-plane component of magnetization to be reversed by an in-plane magnetic
field. Theoretical calculations within the p-d Zener model explain the
magnitude of the out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropy constant caused by epitaxial
strain, but do not explain satisfactorily the cubic anisotropy constant. At the

anisotropy of unknown origin. Similarly to the case of (001) films, this
additional anisotropy can be explained by assuming the existence of a shear
strain. However, in contrast to the (001) samples, this additional strain has

input is an edge weighted tree graph along with customers located at the nodes.
Each customer is associated with a radius and a penalty. The goal is to locate
a tree-shaped facility such that the sum of setup and penalty cost is
minimized. The setup cost equals the sum of edge lengths taken by the facility
and the penalty cost is the sum of penalties of all customers whose distance to
the facility exceeds their radius. The indirect covering subtree problem
generalizes the single maximum coverage location problem on trees where the
facility is a node rather than a subtree. Indirect covering subtree can be
solved in $O(n\log^2 n)$ time (Kim et al., 1996). A slightly faster algorithm
for single maximum coverage location with a running time of
$O(n\log^2n/\log\log n)$ has been provided (Spoerhase and Wirth, 2009). We
achieve time $O(n\log n)$ for indirect covering subtree thereby providing the
fastest known algorithm for both problems. Our result implies also faster
algorithms for competitive location problems such as $(1,X)$-medianoid and
$(1,p)$-centroid on trees. We complement our result by a lower bound of
$\Omega(n\log n)$ for single maximum coverage location and $(1,X)$-medianoid on
a real-number RAM model showing that our algorithm is optimal in running time.

Swift, ROTSE-III and GROND. Compared to other Swift GRBs, GRB 081008 has a
typical gamma-ray isotropic equivalent energy output (10^53 erg) during the
prompt phase, and displayed two temporally separated clusters of pulses. The
early X-ray emission seen by the Swift/XRT was dominated by the softening tail
of the prompt emission, producing multiple flares during and after the
Swift/BAT detections. Optical observations that started shortly after the first
active phase of gamma-ray emission showed two consecutive peaks. We interpret
the first optical peak as the onset of the afterglow associated with the early
burst activities. A second optical peak, coincident with the later gamma-ray
pulses, imposes a small modification to the otherwise smooth lightcurve and
thus suggests a minimal contribution from a probable internal component. We
suggest the early optical variability may be from continuous energy injection
into the forward shock front by later shells producing the second epoch of
burst activities. These early observations thus provide a potential probe for
the transition from prompt to the afterglow phase. The later lightcurve of GRB
081008 displays a smooth steepening in all optical bands and X-ray. The
temporal break is consistent with being achromatic at the observed wavelengths.
Our broad energy coverage shortly after the break constrains a spectral break
within optical. However, the evolution of the break frequency is not observed.
We discuss the plausible interpretations of this behavior.

Gromov-Witten theory of Calabi-Yau rank two bundles over the projective line
and the theory of integrable hierarchies. We first of all construct explicitly,
in a large number of cases, the Hamiltonian dispersionless hierarchies that
govern the full descendent genus zero theory. Our main tool is the application
of Dubrovin's formalism, based on associativity equations, to the known results
on the genus zero theory from local mirror symmetry and localization. The
hierarchies we find are apparently new, with the exception of the resolved
conifold O(-1) + O(-1) -> P1 in the equivariantly Calabi-Yau case. For this
example the relevant dispersionless system turns out to be related to the
long-wave limit of the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice. This identification provides us
with a complete procedure to reconstruct the dispersive hierarchy which should
conjecturally be related to the higher genus theory of the resolved conifold.
We give a complete proof of this conjecture for genus g<=1; our methods are
based on establishing, analogously to the case of KdV, a ""quasi-triviality""
property for the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy at the leading order of the
dispersive expansion. We furthermore provide compelling evidence in favour of
the resolved conifold/Ablowitz-Ladik correspondence at higher genus by testing
it successfully in the primary sector for g=2.

images allow us to explore the presence of bars, detected by visual
classification, throughout a luminosity range of 9 magnitudes ($-23 \lesssim$

luminosities ($-22 \lesssim$ M$_{r} \lesssim -17$) and masses ($10^{9} \lesssim
{\cal M_{*}}/{\cal M}_{\sun} \lesssim 10^{11}$). This result holds when
comparing with a sample of bright/massive field galaxies. In addition, we find
that the bar fraction does not vary significantly when going from the center to
the cluster outskirts, implying that cluster environment plays a second order
role in bar formation/evolution. The shape of the bar fraction distribution
with respect to both luminosity and mass is well matched by the luminosity
distribution of disk galaxies in Coma, indicating that bars are good tracers of
cold stellar disks. We discuss the implications of our results for the

generated by orbiting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with periods between
0.1-10 yr. Previous studies on the nHz GW background assumed that the inspiral
is purely driven by GWs. However, torques generated by a gaseous disk can
shrink the binary much more efficiently than GW emission, reducing the number
of binaries at these separations. We use simple disk models for the
circumbinary gas and for the binary-disk interaction to follow the orbital
decay of MBHBs through physically distinct regions of the disk, until GWs take
over their evolution. We extract MBHB cosmological merger rates from the
Millennium simulation, generate Monte Carlo realizations of a population of gas
driven binaries, and calculate the corresponding GW amplitudes of the most
luminous individual binaries and the stochastic GW background. For steady state
alpha-disks with alpha>0.1 we find that the nHz GW background can be
significantly modified. The number of resolvable binaries is however not
changed by the presence of gas; we predict 1-10 individually resolvable sources
to stand above the noise for a 1-50 ns timing precision. Gas driven migration
reduces predominantly the number of small total mass or unequal mass ratio
binaries, which leads to the attenuation of the mean stochastic GW--background,
but increases the detection significance of individually resolvable binaries.
The results are sensitive to the model of binary--disk interaction. The GW
background is not attenuated significantly for time-dependent models of Ivanov,
Papaloizou, & Polnarev (1999).

dissipational, with centrally accreted gas radiating away its orbital and
thermal energy; the dark matter halo will undergo adiabatic contraction and the
central dark matter density profile will steepen. For the second model, we
assume the central galaxy is assembled by a series of dissipationless mergers
of stellar clumps that have formed far from the nascent galaxy. In order to be
accreted, these clumps lose their orbital energy to the dark matter halo via
dynamical friction, thereby heating the central dark matter and smoothing the
dark matter density cusp. The central dark matter density profiles differ
drastically between these models. For the isolated elliptical galaxy, NGC 4494,
the central dark matter densities follow the power-laws r^(-0.2) and r^(-1.7)
for the dissipational and dissipationless models, respectively. By matching the
dissipational and dissipationless models to observations of the stellar
component of elliptical galaxies, we examine the relative contributions of
dissipational and dissipationless mergers to the formation of elliptical
galaxies and look for observational tests that will distinguish between these
models. Comparisons to strong lensing brightest cluster galaxies yield median
M*/L_B ratios of 2.1+/-0.8 and 5.2+/-1.7 at z=0.39 for the dissipational and

between various s- and d-wave order parameters are studied. We find that the
nematic operator transforms two independent six-dimensional vectors. The d-wave
superconducting, d-density wave, and antiferromagnetic orders are organized
into one vector, and the s-wave superconducting, charge density wave, and
spin-triplet d-density wave orders into the other vector. Each vector acts as a
superspin and transforms under the action of SO(6) where charge, spin, eta- and
pi-pairing, spin-triplet nematic operators satisfy the SO(6) Lie algebra.
Electronic nematic order is not a part of the SO(6) group. It commutes with all
15 generators. Our findings imply that nematic order does not affect the
competition among the order parameters within the same superspin, while it
strongly interferes the interplay between two order parameters that belong to
different superspins. For example, nematicity allows a linear coupling between
d- and s-wave superconducting order parameters which modifies the
superconducting transition temperature. A generalized Ginzburg-Landau theory
and further physical implications are discussed.

significant or even dominant at E > 10 GeV, while inverse Compton scattering
(ICS) from annihilating DM products is insignificant. For the e+e- annihilation
mode, we require a boost factor of order 100 to get significant contribution to
the gamma-ray haze from ICS photons. Possible astrophysical sources of high
energy particles at high latitudes include type Ia supernovae (SNe) and
millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Based on our current understanding of Ia SNe rates,
they do not contribute significantly to gamma-ray flux in the halo of the Milky
Way. As the MSP population in the stellar halo of the Milky Way is not well
constrained, MSPs may be a viable source of gamma-rays at high latitudes
provided that there are ~ 20 000 - 60 000 of MSPs in the Milky Way stellar
halo. In this case, pulsed gamma-ray emission from MSPs can contribute to
gamma-rays around few GeV's while the ICS photons from MSP electrons and
positrons may be significant at all energies in the gamma-ray haze. The
plausibility of such a population of MSPs is discussed. Consistency with the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) microwave haze requires that either
a significant fraction of MSP spin-down energy is converted into e+e- flux or
the DM annihilates predominantly into leptons with a boost factor of order 100.

in a massive gaseous disk in a large primeval galaxy. The gaseous disk we
envisage, roughly 1 kiloparsec (kpc) in size with >~ 10^8 M_Sun of gas, could
have formed as a result of galaxy mergers where tidal interactions removed
angular momentum from gas at larger radius and thereby concentrated it within
the central ~ 1 kpc region. We find that SNe lead to accretion in the disk at a
rate of roughly 0.1 - 1 M_Sun per year and induce star formation at a rate of ~
10 - 100 M_Sun per year which contributes to the formation of a bulge; a part
of the stellar velocity dispersion is due to the speed of SNa shells from which
stars are formed and a part due to the repeated action of the stochastic
gravitational field of the network of SNa remnants on stars. The rate of SNe in
the inner kpc is shown to be self- regulating, and it cycles through phases of
low and high activity. The supernova-assisted accretion transports gas from
about one kpc to within a few pc of the center. If this accretion were to
continue down to the central black hole (BH) then the resulting ratio of BH
mass to the stellar mass in the bulge would be of order ~ 10^-2 - 10^-3, in
line with the observed Magorrian relation.

shown to depend strongly on droplet size, with smaller droplets being absorbed
more quickly. Droplet size is also shown to influence meniscus motion in a

to yield reliable scale-dependent measurements of mass.
  This scale-independent analysis approach is useful for several reasons.
First, it provides a more comprehensive characterization of a map (i.e., not
biased towards a particular spatial scale). Such a lack of bias is extremely
useful for the joint analysis of many data sets taken with different spatial
resolution. This includes comparisons between different cloud complexes.
Second, the multi-scale mass-size data constitutes a unique resource to derive
slopes of mass-size laws (via power-law fits). Such slopes provide singular
constraints on large-scale density gradients in clouds.

Riemannian immersions and submersions, only for few well featured spaces such
as spheres or complex projective spaces (which are Kendall's spaces for 2D

applied to the shape spaces of closed 2D contours based on angular direction
and to Kendall's spaces of shapes of arbitrary dimension. In application to the

are investigated numerically. The behavior of both pressure and viscosity is
smoothly changing qualitatively when starting from a mono-disperse hard-disk
system without dissipation and moving towards a system of (i) poly-disperse,
(ii) soft particles with (iii) considerable dissipation.
  In the rigid, elastic limit of mono-disperse systems, the viscosity is
approximately inverse proportional to the area fraction difference from
$\phi_{\eta} \simeq 0.7$, but the pressure is still finite at $\phi_{\eta}$. In
moderately soft, dissipative and poly-disperse systems, on the other hand, we
confirm the recent theoretical prediction that both scaled pressure (divided by
the kinetic temperature $T$) and scaled viscosity (divided by $\sqrt{T}$)
diverge at the same density, i.e., the jamming transition point $\phi_J >
\phi_\eta$, with the exponents -2 and -3, respectively. Furthermore, we observe
that the critical region of the jamming transition becomes invisible as the
restitution coefficient approaches unity, i.e. for vanishing dissipation.
  In order to understand the conflict between these two different predictions
on the divergence of the pressure and the viscosity, the transition from soft
to hard particles is studied in detail and the dimensionless control parameters
are defined as ratios of various time-scales. We introduce a dimensionless
number, i.e. the ratio of dissipation rate and shear rate, that can identify
the crossover from the scaling of very hard, i.e. rigid disks to the scaling in
the soft, jamming regime.

approach to the analysis of the largest available spectral dataset of 47
Tucanae to determine whether this apparently two-component population is real.
Assuming the two models were equally likely before taking the data into
account, we find that the evidence favours the two-component population model
by a factor of ~3x10^7. Several possible explanations for this result are
explored, namely the evaporation of low-mass stars, a hierarchical merger,
extant remnants of two initially segregated populations, and multiple star
formation epochs. We find the most compelling explanation for the two-component
velocity distribution is that 47 Tuc formed as two separate populations arising
from the same proto-cluster cloud which merged <7.3 +/- 1.5 Gyr ago. This may
also explain the extreme rotation, low mass-to-light ratio and mixed stellar

approaches to solid state quantum information processing. Prototype systems can
be characterized by spectroscopic techniques. Here, we use pulsed-continuous
wave microwave spectroscopy to study the behavior of electrons trapped at
defects within the gate dielectric of a sol-gel-based high-k silicon MOSFET.
Disorder leads to a wide distribution in trap properties, allowing more than
1000 traps to be individually addressed in a single transistor within the
accessible frequency domain. Their dynamical behavior is explored by pulsing
the microwave excitation over a range of times comparable to the phase
coherence time and the lifetime of the electron in the trap. Trap occupancy is
limited to a single electron, which can be manipulated by resonant microwave
excitation and the resulting change in trap occupancy is detected by the change
in the channel current of the transistor. The trap behavior is described by a
classical damped driven simple harmonic oscillator model, with the phase
coherence, lifetime and coupling strength parameters derived from a continuous
wave (CW) measurement only. For pulse times shorter than the phase coherence
time, the energy exchange between traps, due to the coupling, strongly
modulates the observed drain current change. This effect could be exploited for
2-qubit gate operation. The very large number of resonances observed in this
system would allow a complex multi-qubit quantum mechanical circuit to be
realized by this mechanism using only a single transistor.

Depending on the position of the Fe nanoclusters, the bilinear coupling (J1)
exhibits strong variations in magnitude and can even switch between
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic. This effect is explained by the magnetic
coupling between the ferromagnetic films and the magnetic nanoclusters.
Interestingly, the coupling of Fe nanoclusters to a Co film is 160% stronger
than their coupling to a Fe film (at MgO spacing of 0.56 nm). This is much
greater than the coupling difference of 20% observed in the analogous thin film

spectroscopy shows that at peak SN 2009ip had a 10,000 K photosphere and its
spectrum was dominated by narrow H Balmer emission, similar to classical LBV
giant outbursts, also known as ""supernova impostors."" The spectra of UGC 2773
OT2009-1, which also have narrow H alpha emission, are dominated by a forest of
absorption lines, similar to an F-type supergiant. Blueshifted absorption lines
corresponding to ejecta at a velocity of 2000 - 7000 km/s are present in later
spectra of SN 2009ip -- an unprecedented observation for LBV outbursts,
indicating that the event was the result of a supersonic explosion, rather than
a subsonic outburst. The velocity of the absorption lines increases between two
epochs, suggesting that there were two explosions in rapid succession. A rapid
fading and rebrightening event concurrent with the onset of the high-velocity
absorption lines is consistent with the double-explosion model. A near-infrared
excess is present in the spectra and photometry of UGC 2773 OT2009-1 that is
consistent with ~2100 K dust emission. We compare the properties of these two
events and place them in the context of other known massive star outbursts such

that massive star outbursts have many physical differences which can manifest

powerful sources, e.g., Fanaroff-Riley type 2 (FR-II) sources, rather than the
compact ones viewed at larger inclination angles. By comparison with the radio

the plane $\theta=\theta_{0}$, and the general equations of oscillation phases
are given. The effect of the rotation and electric charge on the phase is
presented. Then, we consider three special cases: (1) The neutrinos travel
along the geodesics with the angular momentum $L=aE$ in the equatorial plane.
(2) The neutrinos travel along the geodesics with L=0 in the equatorial plane.
(3) The neutrinos travel along the radial geodesics at the direction
$\theta=0$. At last, we calculate the proper oscillation length in the K-N
space time. The effect of the gravitational field on the oscillation length is
embodied in the gravitational red shift factor. When the neutrino travels out
of the gravitational field, the blue shift of the oscillation length takes
place. We discussed the variation of the oscillation length influenced by the
gravitational field strength, the rotation $a^{2}$ and charge $Q$.

effects, including gravity, turbulent gas dynamics, magnetic fields and

recent years, primarily as a result of our increased ability to incorporate the

this contribution we present an overview of our recent studies of star cluster
formation in turbulent, magnetised clouds using self-gravitating
radiation-magnetohydrodynamics calculations (Price and Bate 2008, 2009). Our
incorporation of magnetic fields and radiative transfer into the Smoothed

and radiative heating of the gas around newborn stars can solve several of the
key puzzles in star formation, including an explanation for why star formation
is such a slow and inefficient process. However, the presence of magnetic
fields at observed strengths in collapsing protostellar cores also leads to
problems on smaller scales, including a difficulty in forming protostellar
discs and binary stars (Price and Bate 2007, Hennebelle and Teyssier 2008),
which suggests that our understanding of the role of magnetic fields in star
formation is not yet complete.

a certain set of additional conditions, but does not own a multiplication
operation in the most general case. A major objective of the present paper is
the search for such examples of the structure mentioned above that do not stem
from Jordan operator algebras; first natural candidates are matrix algebras
over the octonions and other nonassociative rings. Therefore, the case when a
nonassociative commutative multiplication exists is studied without assuming
that it satisfies the Jordan condition. The characteristics of the resulting
algebra are analyzed. This includes the uniqueness of the spectral resolution
as well as a criterion for its existence, subalgebras that are Jordan algebras,
associative subalgebras, and more different levels of compatibility than
occurring in standard quantum mechanics. However, the paper cannot provide the
desired example, but contribute to the search by the identification of some
typical differences between the potential examples and the Jordan operator
algebras and by negative results concerning some first natural candidates. The
possibility that no such example exists cannot be ruled out. However, this
would result in an unexpected new characterization of Jordan operator algebras,

surveys raises the need of an automated and objective classification method.
Unsupervised learning algorithms are of particular interest, since they
discover classes automatically. Aims: We briefly discuss the pitfalls of
oversimplified classification methods and outline an alternative approach
called ""clustering analysis"". Methods: We categorise different classification
methods according to their capabilities. Based on this categorisation, we
present a probabilistic classification algorithm that automatically detects the
optimal classes preferred by the data. We explore the reliability of this
algorithm in systematic tests. Using a small sample of bright galaxies from the
SDSS, we demonstrate the performance of this algorithm in practice. We are able
to disentangle the problems of classification and parametrisation of galaxy
morphologies in this case. Results: We give physical arguments that a
probabilistic classification scheme is necessary. The algorithm we present
produces reasonable morphological classes and object-to-class assignments
without any prior assumptions. Conclusions: There are sophisticated automated
classification algorithms that meet all necessary requirements, but a lot of
work is still needed on the interpretation of the results.

carbon burning during the simmering phase eventually rises the neutron excess
and leads to a smaller 56Ni yield, but does not change substantially the
dependence of M(56Ni) on Z. Uncertain attributes of the WD, like the central
density, have a minor effect on M(56Ni). Our main results are: 1) a sizable
amount of 56 Ni is synthesized during incomplete Si-burning, which leads to a
stronger dependence of M(56Ni) on Z than obtained by assuming that 56Ni is
produced in material that burns fully to nuclear statistical equilibrium; 2) in
one-dimensional delayed detonation simulations a composition dependence of the
deflagration-to-detonation transition density gives a non-linear relationship
between M(56Ni) and Z, and predicts a luminosity larger than previously thought
at low metallicities (however, the progenitor metallicity alone cannot explain
the whole observational scatter of SNIa luminosities), and 3) an accurate
measurement of the slope of the Hubble residuals vs metallicity for a large
enough data set of SNIa might give clues to the physics of
deflagration-to-detonation transition in thermonuclear explosions.

screening theory, systematically. The disorder potential is analyzed
considering the range of the potential fluctuations. Short range part of the
single impurity potential is used to define the conductivity tensor elements
within the self-consistent Born approximation, whereas the long range part is
treated self-consistently at the Hartree level. Using the simple, however,
fundamental Thomas-Fermi screening, we find that the long range disorder
potential is well screened. While, the short range part is approximately
unaffected by screening and is suitable to define the mobility at vanishing
magnetic fields. In light of these range dependencies we discuss the extend of
the quantized Hall plateaus considering the ""mobility"" of the wafer and the
width of the sample, by re-formulating the Ohm's law at low temperatures and
high magnetic fields. We find that, the plateau widths mainly depend on the
long range fluctuations of the disorder, whereas the importance of density of
states broadening is less pronounced and even is predominantly suppressed.
These results are in strong contrast with the conventional single particle
pictures. We show that the widths of the quantized Hall plateaus increase with
increasing disorder, whereas the level broadening is negligible.

have started a programme with GMRT to exploit this correlation at flux density

In our programme, we have obtained deep, high resolution radio observations at
150 MHz with GMRT for several 'deep' fields which are well studied at higher
radio frequencies and in other bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, with an
aim to detect candidate high redshift radio galaxies. In this paper we present
results from the deep 150 MHz observations of LBDS-Lynx field, which has been
already imaged at 327, 610 and 1412 MHz with the WSRT and at 1400 and 4860 MHz

to that of two-point statistics. However, both statistics suffer from
intrinsic-shear alignment, which is one of their limiting systematics. The
nulling technique is a model-independent method developed to eliminate
intrinsic-shear alignment at the two-point level. In this paper we demonstrate
that the nulling technique can also be naturally generalized to the three-point
level, controlling the corresponding GGI systematics. We show that under the
assumption of exact redshift information the intrinsic-shear alignment
contamination can be completely eliminated. To show how well the nulling
technique performs on data with limited redshift information, we apply the
nulling technique to three-point weak lensing statistics from a fictitious
survey analogous to a typical future deep imaging survey, in which the
three-point intrinsic-shear alignment systematics is generated from a power-law
toy model. Using 10 redshift bins, the nulling technique leads to a factor of
10 suppression of the GGI/GGG ratio, and reduces the bias on cosmological
parameters to less than the original statistical error. More detailed redshift
information allowing for finer redshift bins leads to better reduction of bias.
The information loss during the nulling procedure doubles the statistical error
on cosmological parameters. A comparison of the nulling technique with an
unconditioned compression of the data suggests that part of the information
loss can be retained by considering higher-order nulling weights during the

network models of proteins for predicting many equilibrium properties related
to collective modes of motion. Curiously, the results are usually robust
towards the different cutoff distances used for constructing the residue
networks from the knowledge of the experimental coordinates. In this study, we
present a systematical study of network construction, and their effect on the
predicted properties. Probing bond orientational order around each residue, we
propose a natural partitioning of the interactions into an essential and a
residual set. In this picture the robustness originates from the way with which
new contacts are added so that an unusual local orientational order builds up.
These residual interactions have a vanishingly small effect on the force
vectors on each residue. The stability of the overall force balance then
translates into the Hessian as small shifts in the slow modes of motion and an
invariance of the corresponding eigenvectors. We introduce a rescaled version
of the Hessian matrix and point out a link between the matrix Frobenius norm
based on spectral stability arguments. A recipe for the optimal choice of
partitioning the interactions into essential and residual components is
prescribed. Implications for the study of biologically relevant properties of
proteins are discussed with specific examples.

the fact that the language is well suited for reusing existing serial codes

emission.
  We detected significant diffuse excess emission above the particle background

temperature $\Theta \sim 400$ K, while the dynamic component freezes completely
at the temperature T$_{f} \sim 200$ K; together, these components account for
all of the observed spectral weight contributing to the diffuse scattering
cross section. The integrated intensity of the dynamic component peaks near the
temperature at which the frequency-dependent dielectric constant reaches a
maximum (T$_{max}$) when measured at 1 GHz, i. e. on a timescale of $\sim 1$

in rather complicated initial conditions, assuming at least two infalling and

fundamental importance, the properties of BALQSOs are still not well
understood. In order to investigate the X-ray nature of these sources, as well
as the correlations between X-ray and rest-frame UV properties, we compile a
large sample of 88 BALQSOs observed by XMM-Newton. We performed a full X-ray
spectral analysis on a sample of 39 sources with higher X-ray spectral quality,
and an approximate HR analysis on the remaining sources. Using available
optical spectra, we calculate the BALnicity index and investigate the
dependence between this optical parameter and different X-ray properties.
  Using the neutral absorption model, we found that 36% of our BALQSOs have NH
< 5x10^21 cm^-2, lower than the expected X-ray absorption for such objects.
However, when we used a physically-motivated model for the X-ray absorption in
BALQSOs, i.e. ionized absorption, \sim 90% of the objects are absorbed. The
absorption properties also suggest that LoBALs may be physically different
objects from HiBALs. In addition, we report on a correlation between the
ionized absorption column density and BAL parameters. There is evidence (at 98%
level) that the amount of X-ray absorption is correlated with the strength of
high-ionization UV absorption. This correlation, not previously reported, can
be naturally understood in virtually all BALQSO models, as driven by the total
amount of gas mass flowing towards the observer.

~ 23'x 25') mounted at the prime foci of the 8.4m Large Binocular Telescope
(LBT). We performed a weak lensing analysis of the z=0.288 cluster Abell 611 on
g-band data obtained by the blue-optimized Large Binocular Camera in order to
estimate the cluster mass.
  Methods. Due to the complexity of the PSF of LBC, we decided to use two
different approaches, KSB and Shapelets, to measure the shape of background
galaxies and to derive the shear signal produced by the cluster. Then we
estimated the cluster mass with both aperture densitometry and parametric model
fits.
  Results. The combination of the large aperture of the telescope and the wide
field of view allowed us to map a region well beyond the expected virial radius
of the cluster and to get a high surface density of background galaxies (23
galaxies/arcmin^2). This made possible to estimate an accurate mass for Abell
611. We find that the mass within 1.5 Mpc is: $(8\pm3)\times 10^{14} M_\odot$
from the aperture mass technique and $(5\pm1)\times 10^{14} M_\odot$ using the
model fitting by a NFW mass density profile, for both Shapelets and KSB
methods. This analysis demonstrates that LBC is a powerful instrument for weak
gravitational lensing studies.

that injection of electrons (holes) into the Fe atom in the adsorbed Fe-Pc

They suffice to relate the discrete scale with the collective, global scale. At
this global scale, the material behaves as a continuous medium; it is described

transformation on a larger extended system. If the extension used is a heat
bath in thermal equilibrium, the concomitant change in the state of the bath
necessarily implies a heat exchange with it. The dependence of the average heat
transferred to the bath on the initial state of the system can then be found
from the expectation value of a hermitian operator, which is named as the heat
transfer operator (HTO). The purpose of this article is the investigation of
the relation between the HTOs and the associated quantum operations. Since, any
given quantum operation on a system can be realized by different baths and
unitaries, many different HTOs are possible for each quantum operation. On the
other hand, there are also strong restrictions on the HTOs which arise from the
unitarity of the transformations. The most important of these is the Landauer
erasure principle. This article is concerned with the question of finding a
complete set of restrictions on the HTOs that are associated with a given
quantum operation. An answer to this question has been found only for a subset
of quantum operations. For erasure operations, these characterizations are
equivalent to the generalized Landauer erasure principle. For the case of
generic quantum operations however, it appears that the HTOs obey further
restrictions which cannot be obtained from the entropic restrictions of the
generalized Landauer erasure principle.

This allows for one-sample tests previously not possible, and to numerically
assess the `inconsistency of the Procrustes mean' for a perturbation model and
`inconsistency' within a model recently proposed for diffusion tensor imaging.
Also it is shown that the CLT can be extended to mildly rank deficient

applications of lattice reduction. The applications are for lattice bases with
a generalized knapsack-type structure, where the target vectors are boundably
short. For such applications, the complexity of the algorithm improves
traditional lattice reduction by replacing some dependence on the bit-length of
the input vectors by some dependence on the bound for the output vectors. If
the bit-length of the target vectors is unrelated to the bit-length of the
input, then our algorithm is only linear in the bit-length of the input
entries, which is an improvement over the quadratic complexity floating-point
LLL algorithms. To illustrate the usefulness of this algorithm we show that a
direct application to factoring univariate polynomials over the integers leads
to the first complexity bound improvement since 1984. A second application is
algebraic number reconstruction, where a new complexity bound is obtained as
well.

initially receives a private measurement of $\theta$: a number $S_v$ picked
from a Gaussian distribution with mean $\theta$ and standard deviation one.
Then, in each discrete time iteration, each reveals its estimate of $\theta$ to
its neighbors, and, observing its neighbors' actions, updates its belief using
Bayes' Law.
  This process aggregates information efficiently, in the sense that all the

so that each agent's calculation can be easily carried out. We also show that
on any graph the process converges after at most $2N \cdot D$ steps, where $N$

turbulence to reduce the effective number of degrees of freedom necessary to
represent fluctuations. This can be achieved by employing magnetic coordinates
of which one is aligned along the magnetic field. This work presents an
approach in which the position along the field lines is identified by the
toroidal angle, rather than the most commonly used poloidal angle. It will be
shown that this approach has several advantages. Among these, periodicity in
both angles is retained. This property allows moving to an equivalent
representation in Fourier space with a reduced number of toroidal components.
It will be shown how this duality can be exploited to transform conventional
codes that use a spectral representation on the magnetic surface into codes
with a field-aligned coordinate. It is also shown that the new approach can be
generalised to get rid of magnetic coordinates in the poloidal plane
altogether, for a large class of models. Tests are carried out by comparing the
new approach with the conventional approach employing a uniform grid, for a
basic ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence model implemented by the two
corresponding versions of the ETAI3D code. These tests uncover an unexpected
property of the model, that localized large parallel gradients can
intermittently appear in the turbulent regime. This leaves open the question
whether this is a general property of plasma turbulence, which may lead one to
reconsider some of the usual assumptions on micro-turbulence dynamics.

is described and investigated in terms of fit discrepancy and astrometric
performance with respect to number of parameters required. The proposed basis
function is based on the aberration free response of the ideal telescope and
its derivatives, weighted by the source spectral distribution. The influence of
relative position of the detector pixel array with respect to the optical image
is analysed, as well as the variation induced by the source spectral emission.
The number of parameters required for micro-arcsec level consistency of the
reconstructed function with the detected signal is found to be 11. Some
considerations are devoted to the issue of calibration of the instrument
response representation, taking into account the relevant aspects of source
spectrum and focal plane sampling. Additional investigations and other
applications are also suggested.

media have generated considerable interest due to their potential for optical
device miniaturization. In this context plasmonics, i.e., optics based on
surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) offers new exciting prospects. SPPs are
hybrid light/electron surface waves at the interface between a dielectric and a
metal and as such hold the potential for 2D optical functionality. Indeed, SPP
elements as mirrors, splitters and interferometers have been recently
demonstrated. However, for plasmonics to qualify at the information technology
level requires necessarily the realization of wavelength division
(demultiplexing) which constitutes a fundamental ingredient of optical
communication. In the following we experimentally demonstrate 2D SPP
demultiplexing in the visible spectral range by using photonic crystals for
SPPs (plasmonic crystals). In addition, we demonstrate that plasmonic crystal
are capable of realizing integrated linear multiports which could constitute
building blocks of analog or quantum optical computing.

every agent) can be stabilized. Nonetheless for large flocks perturbations in
the movement of the leader may grow to a considerable size as they propagate
throughout the flock and before they die out over time. As an example we
consider a string of N+1 oscillators moving in the line. Each one `observes'
the relative velocity and position of only its nearest neighbors. This
information is then used to determine its own acceleration. Now we fix all
parameters except the number of oscillators. We then show (within a certain
class of systems) that a perturbation in the leader's orbit is almost always
amplified exponentially in N as it propagates towards the outlying members of
the flock. The only exception is when there is a symmetry present in the
interaction: in that case the growth of the perturbation is linear in N.

topology of the Fe dxz+yz states, which are found to contribute substantially
at the Fermi level. The energies and detailed orbital character of Fe and As
derived unoccupied s and d states are found to be in remarkably good agreement
with the predictions of standard density functional theory.
