of the molecular gas in the z = 4.05 submillimeter galaxy GN20. GN20 is one of
the most luminous starburst galaxy known at z > 4, and is a member of a rich
proto-cluster of galaxies at z = 4.05 in GOODS-North. We have observed the CO
1-0 and 2-1 emission with the VLA, the CO 6-5 emission with the PdBI
Interferometer, and the 5-4 emission with CARMA. The H_2 mass derived from the
CO 1-0 emission is 1.3 \times 10^{11} (\alpha/0.8) Mo. High resolution imaging
of CO 2-1 shows emission distributed over a large area, appearing as partial
ring, or disk, of ~ 10kpc diameter. The integrated CO excitation is higher than
found in the inner disk of the Milky Way, but lower than that seen in high
redshift quasar host galaxies and low redshift starburst nuclei. The VLA CO 2-1
image at 0.2"" resolution shows resolved, clumpy structure, with a few brighter
clumps with intrinsic sizes ~ 2 kpc. The velocity field determined from the CO
6-5 emission is consistent with a rotating disk with a rotation velocity of ~
570 km s^{-1} (using an inclination angle of 45^o), from which we derive a
dynamical mass of 3 \times 10^{11} \msun within about 4 kpc radius. The star
formation distribution, as derived from imaging of the radio synchrotron and
dust continuum, is on a similar scale as the molecular gas distribution. The
molecular gas and star formation are offset by ~ 1"" from the HST I-band
emission, implying that the regions of most intense star formation are highly
dust-obscured on a scale of ~ 10 kpc. The large spatial extent and ordered
rotation of this object suggests that this is not a major merger, but rather a
clumpy disk accreting gas rapidly in minor mergers or smoothly from the
proto-intracluster medium. ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

dynamics of condensates in a trapping potential and also to study the emergence

development of quantum correlations between the terminal places of these

single out the role of individual elements in such intermingled systems, or
which is the best way to quantify their importance. Centrality measures
describe a node's importance by its position in a network. The key issue
obviated is that the contribution of a node to the collective behavior is not
uniquely determined by the structure of the system but it is a result of the
interplay between dynamics and network structure. We show that dynamical
influence measures explicitly how strongly a node's dynamical state affects
collective behavior. For critical spreading, dynamical influence targets nodes
according to their spreading capabilities. For diffusive processes it
quantifies how efficiently real systems may be controlled by manipulating a

combined with the angular resolution and sensitivity of the LAT allow us to
make the most detailed study to date of the energy-dependent light curves and
phase-resolved spectra, using a LAT-derived timing model. The light curve
consists of two peaks (P1 and P2) connected by bridge emission containing a
third peak (P3). We have confirmed the strong decrease of the P1/P2 ratio with
increasing energy seen with EGRET and previous Fermi LAT data, and observe that
P1 disappears above 20 GeV. The increase with energy of the mean phase of the
P3 component can be followed with much greater detail, showing that P3 and P2
are present up to the highest energies of pulsation. We find significant pulsed
emission at phases outside the main profile, indicating that magnetospheric
emission exists over 80% of the pulsar period. With increased high-energy
counts the phase-averaged spectrum is seen to depart from a power- law with
simple exponential cutoff, and is better fit with a more gradual cutoff. The
spectra in fixed-count phase bins are well fit with power-laws with exponential
cutoffs, revealing a strong and complex phase dependence of the cutoff energy,
especially in the peaks. By combining these results with predictions of the
outer magnetosphere models that map emission characteristics to phase, it will
be possible to probe the particle acceleration and the structure of the pulsar
magnetosphere with unprecedented detail.

homogeneous Poisson measures and many deterministic measures (simple example:
one atom at each point of Z), by means of a new unified approach. In previous
papers, in the homogeneous Poisson case, for the branching system in ""low""
dimensions, the limit was characterized by a long-range dependent Gaussian
process called sub-fractional Brownian motion (sub-fBm), and this effect was
attributed to the branching because it had appeared only in that case. An
unexpected finding in this paper is that sub-fBm is more prevalent than
previously thought. Namely, it is a natural ingredient of the limit process in
the non-branching case (for ""low"" dimension), as well. On the other hand,
fractional Brownian motion is not only related to systems in equilibrium (e.g.,
non-branching system with initial homogeneous Poisson measure), but it also
appears here for a wider class of initial measures of quasi-homogeneous type.

Here we report on two versions of a LISA-oriented string-burst search pipeline
that we have developed and tested within the context of the Mock LISA Data
Challenges. The two versions rely on the publicly available MultiNest and PyMC
software packages, respectively. To reduce the effective dimensionality of the
search space, our implementations use the F-statistic to analytically maximize
over the signal's amplitude and polarization, A and psi, and use the FFT to
search quickly over burst arrival times t_C. The standard F-statistic is
essentially a frequentist statistic that maximizes the likelihood; we also
demonstrate an approximate, Bayesian version of the F-statistic that
incorporates realistic priors on A and psi. We calculate how accurately LISA
can expect to measure the physical parameters of string-burst sources. To
understand LISA's angular resolution for string-burst sources, we draw maps of
the waveform fitting factor [maximized over (A psi, t_C)] as a function of sky
position; these maps dramatically illustrate why (for LISA) inferring the
correct sky location of the emitting string loop will often be practically
impossible. We also identify and elucidate several symmetries that are imbedded
in this search problem, and we derive the distribution of cut-off frequencies
f_max for observable bursts.

this coupling is crucial in determining which phenomena can be observed in such
a system. Here we demonstrate that avoided crossings in the spectrum of an
optical cavity containing a flexible dielectric membrane allow us to realize
several different forms of the optomechanical coupling. These include cavity
detunings that are (to lowest order) linear, quadratic, or quartic in the
membrane's displacement, and a cavity finesse that is linear in (or independent
of) the membrane's displacement. All these couplings are realized in a single
device with extremely low optical loss and can be tuned over a wide range in
situ; in particular, we find that the quadratic coupling can be increased three
orders of magnitude beyond previous devices. As a result of these advances, the
device presented here should be capable of demonstrating the quantization of
the membrane's mechanical energy.

scaling is consistent with the expectation from thin disk theory (R ~
M_BH^{2/3}), but when interpreted in terms of the standard thin disk model (T ~
R^{-3/4}), it implies that black holes radiate with very low efficiency,
log(eta) = -1.77\pm0.29 + log(L/L_E) where eta=L/(Mdot*c^2). Only by making the
maximum reasonable shifts in the average inclination, Eddington factors and
black hole masses can we raise the efficiency estimate to be marginally
consistent with typical efficiency estimates (eta ~ 10%). With one exception,
these sizes are larger by a factor of ~4 than the size needed to produce the
observed 0.8 micron quasar flux by thermal radiation from a thin disk with the
same T ~ R^{-3/4} temperature profile. While scattering a significant fraction
of the disk emission on large scales or including a large fraction of

with mixed spacial and spin degrees of freedom. A modified Pauli equation,

variables in this field, of which only 13 (all of them bright Cepheids) were
previously known. Out of the confirmed variables, we found 90 RR Lyrae stars,
49 classical Cepheids (including 36 new discoveries), and 38 eclipsing binary
stars for which we could determine a period. The RR Lyrae include 61
fundamental (RRab) and 24 first-overtone (RRc) pulsators, and 5 pulsating in
both modes simultaneously (RRd). As for the majority of LG dwarfs, the mean
periods of the RRab and RRc (0.611 and 0.334 day, respectively) as well as the
fraction of overtone pulsators (f_c=0.28) place this galaxy in the intermediate
regime between the Oosterhoff types. From their position on the
period-luminosity diagram and light-curve morphology, we can unambiguously
classify 25 and 14 Cepheids as fundamental and first-overtone mode pulsators,
respectively. Another two are clearly second-overtone Cepheids, the first ones
to be discovered beyond the Magellanic Clouds. We estimate the distance to
IC1613 using various methods based on the photometric and pulsational
properties of the Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars. The values we find are in very
good agreement with each other and with previous estimates based on independent
methods. When corrected to a common reddening of E(B-V)=0.025 and true LMC
distance modulus of (m-M)_{LMC,0}=18.515+-0.085, we find that all the distance

Assuming that each transaction conflicts with at most C other transactions

The first algorithm Offline-Greedy produces a schedule of length O(C + N

second algorithm Online-Greedy produces a schedule of length O(C log(MN) + N

propagation speeds for quantum systems on lattices and also general graphs

available optical and near-infrared line fluxes from the literature between

total mass of the ionized gas of ~0.058 Msun within the inner ring. Abundances
inferred from the optical and near-infrared data were also complemented with
estimates of Lundqvist & Fransson (1996) based on ultraviolet lines. This way
we found an He/H-ratio (by number of atoms) of 0.17+-0.06 which is roughly 30%
lower than previously estimated and twice the solar and the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) value. We found an N/O-ratio of 1.5+-0.7, and the total
(C+N+O)/(H+He) abundance about 1.6 times its LMC value or roughly 0.6 times the
most recent solar value. An iron abundance of 0.20+-0.11 times solar was found

required to explain the data of the highest ionization lines. Such low density
gas is expected in the H II-region interior to the inner ring which likely
extends also to larger radii at higher latitudes (out of the ring plane). At
epochs later than ~5000 days our models underproduce the emission of most of
these lines as expected due to the contribution from the interaction of the

ISW-galaxy cross-correlations. Deviations from Lambda CDM are parameterized by
phenomenological modifications to the Poisson equation and the relationship

the known population of Ly_alpha emitters (LAEs) and [OIII] emitters, we use
colour selection techniques to identify protocluster candidates that are Lyman
break galaxies (LBG) and Balmer break galaxies (BBGs). The radio galaxy field
contains an excess of LBG candidates, with a surface density 1.6\pm0.3 times
larger than found for comparable blank fields. This surface overdensity
corresponds to an LBG volume overdensity of ~8\pm4. The BBG photometric
redshift distribution peaks at the protocluster's redshift, but we detect no
significant surface overdensity of BBG. This is not surprising because a volume
overdensity similar to the LBGs would have resulted in a surface density of
~1.2 that found in the blank field. This could not have been detected in our
sample. Masses and star formation rates of the candidate protocluster galaxies
are determined using SED fitting. These properties are not significantly
different from those of field galaxies. The galaxies with the highest masses

feedback. A comprehensive catalog of subhalos has been compiled and properties
of subhalos analyzed in the mass range of 10^8 Mo - 10^11 Mo. We find that
subhalo mass functions are consistent with a single power law, M_sbh^{alpha},
but detect a nonnegligible shift between these functions, alpha -0.86 for the
PDM, and -0.98 for the BDM. Overall, alpha const. in time with variations of
+-15%. Second, we find that the radial mass distribution of subhalos can be
approximated by a power law, R^{gamma} with a steepening around the radius of a
maximal circular velocity, Rvmax, in the prime halos. Gamma ~-1.5 for the PDM
and -1 for the BDM, inside Rvmax, and is steeper outside. We detect little
spatial bias between the subhalo populations and the DM of the main halos. The
subhalo population exhibits much less triaxiality with baryons, in tandem with
the prime halo. Finally, we find that, counter-intuitively, the BDM population
is depleted at a faster rate than the PDM one within the central 30kpc of the
prime. Although the baryons provide a substantial glue to the subhalos, the
main halos exhibit the same trend. This assures a more efficient tidal
disruption of the BDM subhalos. This effect can be reversed for a more
efficient feedback from stellar evolution and supermassive black holes, which
will expel baryons from the center and decrease the concentration of the prime
halo. We compare our results with via Lactea and Aquarius simulations and other
published results.

has long been a challenge for students of evolutionary biology. The populations
with altruistic individuals thrive better than those without altruists;
however, the altruists within a population thrive worse than the non-altruists
and their prevalence in the population decreases due to individual selection.
Under certain conditions, the strength of group selection, i.e. the competition
between populations, can surpass the strength of individual selection; however,
such conditions are rarely achieved in practice. It was suggested recently that
chances for altruistic behavior to spread highly increase when it is controlled
not by a single gene but by multiple independent genes substitutable in their
effects on the phenotype of the individual. Here we confirm the original verbal
model published as part of the frozen plasticity theory by numerical modeling
of the spread of altruistic/selfish alleles in a metapopulation consisting of
partly isolated groups of organisms (demes) interconnected by migration. We
have shown that altruistic behavior coded by multiple substitutable genes can
stably coexist with selfish behavior, even under relatively high mutation and
migration rates, i.e. under such conditions where altruistic behavior coded by
a single gene is quickly outcompeted in a metapopulation.

Green's function) between multiple source-receiver pairs. Typically, the
channel responses are estimated one-at-a-time: a single source sends out a
known probe signal, the receiver measures the probe signal convolved with the
channel response, and the responses are recovered using deconvolution. In this
paper, we show that if the channel responses are sparse and the probe signals
are random, then we can significantly reduce the total amount of time required
to probe the channels by activating all of the sources simultaneously. With all
sources activated simultaneously, the receiver measures a superposition of all
the channel responses convolved with the respective probe signals. Separating
this cumulative response into individual channel responses can be posed as a
linear inverse problem.
  We show that channel response separation is possible (and stable) even when
the probing signals are relatively short in spite of the corresponding linear
system of equations becoming severely underdetermined. We derive a theoretical
lower bound on the length of the source signals that guarantees that this
separation is possible with high probability. The bound is derived by putting
the problem in the context of finding a sparse solution to an underdetermined
system of equations, and then using mathematical tools from the theory of
compressive sensing. Finally, we discuss some practical applications of these
results, which include forward modeling for seismic imaging, channel
equalization in multiple-input multiple-output communication, and increasing
the field-of-view in an imaging system by using coded apertures.

limit the answer for a large class of theories has been known for some time.
However, in the full quantum theory the U-duality group is broken to a discrete
subgroup and the question of U-duality orbits in this case is a nuanced matter.
In the present work we address this issue in the context of N=8 supergravity in
four, five and six dimensions. The purpose of this note is to present and
clarify what is currently known about these discrete orbits while at the same
time filling in some of the details not yet appearing in the literature. To
this end we exploit the mathematical framework of integral Jordan algebras and
Freudenthal triple systems. The charge vector of the dyonic black string in D=6
is SO(5,5;Z) related to a two-charge reduced canonical form uniquely specified
by a set of two arithmetic U-duality invariants. Similarly, the black hole
(string) charge vectors in D=5 are E_{6(6)}(Z) equivalent to a three-charge
canonical form, again uniquely fixed by a set of three arithmetic U-duality
invariants. The situation in four dimensions is less clear: while black holes
preserving more than 1/8 of the supersymmetries may be fully classified by
known arithmetic E_{7(7)}(Z) invariants, 1/8-BPS and non-BPS black holes yield
increasingly subtle orbit structures, which remain to be properly understood.
However, for the very special subclass of projective black holes a complete
classification is known. All projective black holes are E_{7(7)}(Z) related to
a four or five charge canonical form determined uniquely by the set of known
arithmetic U-duality invariants. Moreover, E_{7(7)}(Z) acts transitively on the
charge vectors of black holes with a given leading-order entropy.

astrophysics, from the chemical evolution of galaxies to observational
cosmology. However, the nature of the progenitors of SNe Ia is still unclear.
In this paper, according to a detailed binary population synthesis study, we
obtained SN Ia birthrates and delay times from different progenitor models, and
compared them with observations. We find that the Galactic SN Ia birthrate from
the double-degenerate (DD) model is close to those inferred from observations,
while the birthrate from the single-degenerate (SD) model accounts for only
about 1/2-2/3 of the observations. If a single starburst is assumed, the
distribution of the delay times of SNe Ia from the SD model is a weak
bimodality, where the WD + He channel contributes to the SNe Ia with delay
times shorter than 100Myr, and the WD + MS and WD + RG channels to those with
age longer than 1Gyr.

the corresponding properties of fluid membranes, and to theoretical predictions

spontaneous curvature of the monolayers changes sign from the fluid to the gel
phase. In the gel phase, the long-wavelength height fluctuations are
suppressed, and the fluctuation spectrum is highly anisotropic. In the
direction of tilt, it carries the signature of soft modes that are compatible
with the wavelength of the ripple phase, which emerges in the transition region
between the fluid and the gel state. In the direction perpendicular to the
tilt, the thickness fluctuations are almost entirely suppressed, and the height

out-of-layer fluctuations, up to length scales of tens of nanometers.

is testing whether the fraction of members with a circumstellar disk in a
sample of clusters in the cloud D of the Vela Molecular Ridge, is consistent
with relations derived for larger samples of star clusters with an age spread.
Besides, we want to constrain the age of the young embedded star clusters
associated with cloud D. Methods. We carried out L (3.78 microns) photometry on
images of six young embedded star clusters associated with cloud D of the Vela
Molecular Ridge, taken with ISAAC at the VLT. These data are complemented with
the available HKs photometry. The 6 clusters are roughly of the same size and
appear to be in the same evolutionary stage. The fraction of stars with a
circumstellar disk was measured in each cluster by counting the fraction of
sources displaying a NIR excess in colour-colour (HKsL) diagrams. Results. The
L photometry allowed us to identify the NIR counterparts of the IRAS sources
associated with the clusters. The fraction of stars with a circumstellar disk
appears to be constant within errors for the 6 clusters. There is a hint that
this is lower for the most massive stars. The age of the clusters is
constrained to ~1-2 Myr. Conclusions. The fraction of stars with a
circumstellar disk in the observed sample is consistent with the relations
derived from larger samples of star clusters and with other age estimates for
cloud D. The fraction may be lower for the most massive stars. Our results
agree with a scenario where all intermediate and low-mass stars form with a
disk, whose lifetime is shorter for higher mass stars.

field in the curved spacetime around a rotating black hole, we investigate the
appearance of a black hole seen by an observer located near the black hole.
When the black hole is in front of a source of illumination the black hole cast
shadow in the illumination. Accordingly, the appearance of the black hole is
called the black hole shadow.
  Methods. We first analytically describe the shape of the shadow in terms of
constants of motion for a photon seen by the observer in the locally
non-rotating reference frame (LNRF). Then, we newly derive the useful equation
for the solid angle of the shadow. In a third step, we can easily plot the
apparent image of the black hole shadow. Finally, we also calculate the ratio
of the photon trapped by the hole and the escape photon to the distant region
for photons emitted near the black hole.
  Results. From the shape and the size of the black hole shadow, we can
understand the signatures of the curved spacetime; i.e., the mass and spin of
the black hole. Our equations for the solid angle of the shadow has technical
advantages in calculating the photon trapping ratio. That is, this equation is
computationally very easy, and gives extremely precise results. This is because
this equation is described by the one-parameter integration with given values
of the spin and location for the black hole considered. After this, the solid
angle can be obtained without numerical calculations of the null geodesics for
photons.

scalar field pulses using numerical simulations. Double-null formalism is
employed to implement the numerical simulations. If we supply a scalar field
pulse, it will asymptotically form a black hole via dynamical interactions of
the Brans-Dicke field. Hence, we can observe the responses of the Brans-Dicke
field by two different regions. First, we observe the late time behaviors after
the gravitational collapse, which include formations of a singularity and an
apparent horizon. Second, we observe the fully dynamical behaviors during the
gravitational collapse and view the energy-momentum tensor components. For the
late time behaviors, if the Brans-Dicke coupling is greater (or smaller) than
-1.5, the Brans-Dicke field decreases (or increases) during the gravitational
collapse. Since the Brans-Dicke field should be relaxed to the asymptotic value
with the elapse of time, the final apparent horizon becomes time-like (or
space-like). For the dynamical behaviors, we observed the energy-momentum
tensors around $\omega$ ~ -1.5. If the Brans-Dicke coupling is greater than
-1.5, the $T_{uu}$ component can be negative at the outside of the black hole.
This can allow an instantaneous inflating region during the gravitational
collapse. If the Brans-Dicke coupling is less than -1.5, the oscillation of the
$T_{vv}$ component allows the apparent horizon to shrink. This allows a
combination that violates weak cosmic censorship. Finally, we discuss the
implications of the violation of the null energy condition and weak cosmic
censorship.

finite chemical potential, the phase transition is first order. In comparison
with the mean-field results, the critical temperature and chemical potential
are slightly reduced. We determine spectral functions from the Euclidean
propagators by employing the Maximum-Entropy-Method (MEM). Thereby quark and
meson masses are estimated and decay channels identified. For testing this
method, we also apply it to evaluate perturbative spectral functions, which can
be calculated directly in Minkowski space. In most cases we find that MEM is
able to reproduce the rough features of the spectral functions, but not the
details.

Decomposition (SVD) and X-Codes are then used to pair the subchannels. X-Codes
are fully characterized by the pairings and a $2\times 2$ real rotation matrix
for each pair (parameterized with a single angle). This precoding structure
enables us to express the total mutual information as a sum of the mutual
information of all the pairs. The problem of finding the optimal precoder with
the above structure, which maximizes the total mutual information, is solved by
{\em i}) optimizing the rotation angle and the power allocation within each
pair and {\em ii}) finding the optimal pairing and power allocation among the
pairs. It is shown that the mutual information achieved with the proposed
pairing scheme is very close to that achieved with the optimal precoder by Cruz

Lozano {\em et al.}. Our approach greatly simplifies both the precoder
optimization and the detection complexity, making it suitable for practical

stimuli. These signals are transmitted and processed by biochemical signalling
networks. However, the biochemical reactions making up these networks are
intrinsically noisy, which limits the reliability of intracellular signalling.
Here we use information theory to characterise the reliability of transmission
of time-varying signals through elementary biochemical reactions in the
presence of noise. We calculate the mutual information for both instantaneous
measurements and trajectories of biochemical systems for a Gaussian model. Our
results indicate that the same network can have radically different
characteristics for the transmission of instantaneous signals and trajectories.
For trajectories, the ability of a network to respond to changes in the input
signal is determined by the timing of reaction events, and is independent of
the correlation time of the output of the network. We also study how reliably
signals on different time-scales can be transmitted by considering the
frequency-dependent coherence and gain-to-noise ratio. We find that a detector
that does not consume the ligand molecule upon detection can more reliably
transmit slowly varying signals, while an absorbing detector can more reliably
transmit rapidly varying signals. Furthermore, we find that while one reaction
may more reliably transmit information than another when considered in
isolation, when placed within a signalling cascade the relative performance of
the two reactions can be reversed. This means that optimising signal
transmission at a single level of a signalling cascade can reduce signalling
performance for the cascade as a whole.

field and plays an important role in magnetic flux budget and in various solar
activities. There are two major theoretical scenarios for this phenomena, i.e.
the ""U-loop emergence"" and the Omega-loop submergence models. It is important
to clarify which is the dominant process during the cancellation for the
estimation of the solar magnetic flux transport through the surface. We study
the vector magnetic field and velocity structures around a quiet Sun
cancellation by using the Solar Optical Telescope on board Hinode satellite.
Transverse magnetic field connecting the canceling magnetic features and strong
long-lasting Doppler red-shift signal are found. The transverse field is
observed in the first spectropolarimetric observation after the occurrence of
the cancellation while the red-shift clearly delayed to the cancellation by 20
minutes. These results indicate that the observed cancellation is an Omega-loop
submergence.

function of measurement bandwidth and cantilever oscillation. For large
oscillation amplitude and low bandwidth, this relation converges to the result
known from the literature, while for low oscillation amplitude and large

the relation known so far. The results presented in this work fundamentally

empirical conditional probability of their consequent given the antecedent,
and/or by some other parameter bounds such as ""support"" or deviation from
independence. We study here notions of redundancy among association rules from
a fundamental perspective. We see each transaction in a dataset as an
interpretation (or model) in the propositional logic sense, and consider
existing notions of redundancy, that is, of logical entailment, among
association rules, of the form ""any dataset in which this first rule holds must
obey also that second rule, therefore the second is redundant"". We discuss
several existing alternative definitions of redundancy between association
rules and provide new characterizations and relationships among them. We show
that the main alternatives we discuss correspond actually to just two variants,
which differ in the treatment of full-confidence implications. For each of
these two notions of redundancy, we provide a sound and complete deduction
calculus, and we show how to construct complete bases (that is,
axiomatizations) of absolutely minimum size in terms of the number of rules. We
explore finally an approach to redundancy with respect to several association
rules, and fully characterize its simplest case of two partial premises.

lattices such as the root lattices $D_4$ and $E_8$, the Barnes-Wall lattice
$BW_{16}$, the unimodular lattice $D_{12}^+$ and the Leech lattice
$\Lambda_{24}$ may be generated by entangled quantum gates of the corresponding
dimension. These (real) gates/lattices are useful for quantum error correction:
for instance, the two and four-qubit real Clifford groups are the automorphism
groups of the lattices $D_4$ and $BW_{16}$, respectively, and the three-qubit
real Clifford group is maximal in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. Technically, the
automorphism group $Aut(\Lambda)$ of the lattice $\Lambda$ is the set of
orthogonal matrices $B$ such that, following the conjugation action by the
generating matrix of the lattice, the output matrix is unimodular (of
determinant $\pm 1$, with integer entries). When the degree $n$ is equal to the
number of basis elements of $\Lambda$, then $Aut(\Lambda)$ also acts on basis
vectors and is generated with matrices $B$ such that the sum of squared entries
in a row is one, i.e. $B$ may be seen as a quantum gate. For the dense lattices
listed above, maximal multipartite entanglement arises. In particular, one
finds a balanced tripartite entanglement in $E_8$ (the two- and three- tangles
have equal magnitude 1/4) and a GHZ type entanglement in BW$_{16}$. In this
paper, we also investigate the entangled gates from $D_{12}^+$ and
$\Lambda_{24}$, by seeing them as systems coupling a qutrit to two- and
three-qubits, respectively. Apart from quantum computing, the work may be
related to particle physics in the spirit of \cite{PLS2010}.

the oldest main sequence turn-offs, which allows us to estimate the age and
duration of the main episode of star formation in Cetus. This is well
approximated by a single episode that peaked roughly 12+/-0.5 Gyr ago and
lasted no longer than about 1.9+/-0.5 Gyr (FWHM). Our solution also suggests
that essentially no stars formed in Cetus during the past 8 Gyrs. This makes
Cetus' SFH comparable to that of the oldest Milky Way dSphs. Given the current
isolation of Cetus in the outer fringes of the Local Group, this implies that
Cetus is a clear outlier in the morphology-Galactocentric distance relation
that holds for the majority of Milky Way dwarf satellites. Our results also
show that Cetus continued forming stars through z ~ 1, long after the Universe

It is characterised by a high packet rate compared to other protocols used in

In this paper, to enable the detection of steganographic exchanges in VoIP, we

events as a function of one or two decay angles and correspond to large
features of the full angular distribution in the Standard Model: Afb, Fl, and

that measuring S5 adds complementary sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard
model. Like Afb, it features a zero-crossing point with reduced hadronic
uncertainties at leading order and in the large recoil limit. We explore the
experimental sensitivity to this point at LHCb and show that it may be measured
with high precision due to the steepness of the S5 distribution. Current
experimental model independent constraints on parameter space are presented and
predictions made for the values of the Afb and S5 zero-crossing points. The

parity-check (LDPC) codes. The liftings are designed to eliminate dominant
trapping sets of the base code by removing the short cycles which form the
trapping sets. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the cyclic
permutations assigned to the edges of a cycle $c$ of length $\ell(c)$ in the
base graph such that the inverse image of $c$ in the lifted graph consists of
only cycles of length strictly larger than $\ell(c)$. The proposed method is
universal in the sense that it can be applied to any LDPC code over any channel
and for any iterative decoding algorithm. It also preserves important
properties of the base code such as degree distributions, encoder and decoder
structure, and in some cases, the code rate. The proposed method is applied to
both structured and random codes over the binary symmetric channel (BSC). The
error floor improves consistently by increasing the lifting degree, and the
results show significant improvements in the error floor compared to the base
code, a random code of the same degree distribution and block length, and a
random lifting of the same degree. Similar improvements are also observed when
the codes designed for the BSC are applied to the additive white Gaussian noise

estimation is via solving estimating equations. In addition, the construction
of such estimating equations routinely requires solving integral equations,

variable selection procedures are not applicable, and in the measurement error

develop a framework for variable selection in measurement error models via
penalized estimating equations. We first propose a class of selection

of the proposed procedures. Then, under certain regularity conditions and with
a properly chosen regularization parameter, we demonstrate that the proposed

multiorbital systems in previous investigations. It is also observed that if,
instead, a purely intraband pairing interaction is postulated, this requires
that the pairing operator has the form $\Delta^+(k)=f(k) \sum_{\alpha}

orbitals considered in the model and f(k) arises from the spatial location of
the coupled electrons or holes. This means that the gaps at two different Fermi
surfaces involving momenta $k_F$ and $k'_F$ can only differ by the ratio
$f(k_F)/ f(k'_F)$ and that electrons in different orbitals must be subject to
the same pairing attraction, thus requiring fine tuning. These results suggest
that previously neglected interband pairing tendencies could actually be of

statistics and Bayes theory. However, asymptotic results have generally been
only first order (the CLT and weak convergence). We give third order
asymptotics for the distribution and percentiles of any smooth functional of a

accuracy over earlier CLT results.

is to explain the observed behaviour of HR 7355 based on period analysis of all
available photometry. Over two years, we acquired 114 new BV observations of HR
7355 at observatories in Arizona, U.S.A and Cape Town, South Africa. We
performed period analyses of the new observations along with new analyses of
732 archival measurements from the Hipparcos and ASAS projects. We find that
the light curves of HR 7355 in various filters are quite similar, with
amplitudes 0.035(4), 0.036(4), and 0.038(3) mag in B, Hp and V, respectively.
The light curves are double-peaked, with unevenly deep minima. We substantially
refine the rotational period to be P=0.5214410(4) d, indicating that HR 7355 is
the most rapidly rotating CP star known. Our period analyses reveal a possible
lengthening of the rotational period with dP/dt/P = 2.4(8)x 10^-6/yr. We
conclude that the shape and amplitude of HR 7355 light curves are typical of
magnetic He-strong CP stars, for which light variations are the result of
photospheric spots on the surface of a rotating star. We hypothesise that the
light variations are caused mainly by an uneven distribution of overabundant
helium on the star's surface. We briefly describe and discuss the cause of the
rapid rotational braking of the star.

showing in particular (besides reviewing the issue of its duality invariance)
that W has the properties of a Liapunov's function, which implies that its
extrema (associated with the horizon of extremal black holes) are
asymptotically stable equilibrium points of the corresponding first order
dynamical system (in the sense of Liapunov). Moreover, we show that the fake
superpotential W has, along the entire radial flow, the same flat directions
which exist at the attractor point. This allows to study properties of the ADM

behaviour of a quantum mode susceptible to a change in the number of quanta
between one and two. In most systems the strength of nonlinearity is weak, such
that changes at the single quantum level have little effect. Here, we consider
coupled quantum modes and and that they can be strongly sensitive at the single
quantum level, even if nonlinear interactions are modest. As examples, we
consider solid-state implementations based on the tunneling of polaritons
between quantum boxes or their parametric modes in a microcavity. We find that
these systems can act as promising single photon emitters.

bulk irrelevant operators of scaling dimension x>2, in which case the leading
corrections are of the expected form L^{-2(x-2)} for values of n close to 1.
However for n>x/(x-2) corrections of the form L^{2-x-x/n} and L^{-2x/n} arise
and dominate the conventional terms. We also point out that the last type of
corrections can also occur with x less than 2. They arise from relevant
operators induced by the conical space-time singularities necessary to describe
the reduced density matrix. These agree with recent analytic and numerical
results for quantum spin chains. We also compute the effect of marginally

universal amplitude. We present analogous results for the case when the

SOT/SP is free from the seeing effect and has better spatial resolution, we
were able to resolve small magnetic polarities with sizes of 1"" to 2"", and we
could detect strong horizontal magnetic fields, which converge or diverge in
negative or positive facular polarities. These findings support models which
suggest the existence of small vertical flux tube bundles in faculae. A new
method is proposed to get the relative formation heights of the multi-lines

be, and how it evolved over cosmic time. However, we know very little about the
secular processes associated with disk evolution. One major uncertainty is the
extent to which stars migrate radially through the disk, thereby washing out
signatures of their past (e.g. birth sites). Recent theoretical work finds that
such ""blurring"" of the disk can be important if spiral arms are transient
phenomena. Here we describe an experiment to determine the importance of
diffusion from the Solar circle with cosmic time. Consider a star cluster that
has been placed into a differentially rotating, stellar fluid. We show that all
clusters up to ~10^4 solar masses, and a significant fraction of those up to
~10^5 solar masses, are expected to be chemically homogeneous, and that
clusters of this size can be assigned a unique ""chemical tag"" by measuring the
abundances of <~10 independent element groups, with better age and orbit
determinations allowing fewer abundance measurements. The star cluster
therefore acts like a ""tracer dye"", and the present-day distribution of its
stars provides a strong constraint on the rate of radial diffusion or migration
in the Galactic disk. Sellwood & Binney have argued for strong radial transport
driven by transient spiral perturbations: in principle, we could measure the
strength of this migration directly.
