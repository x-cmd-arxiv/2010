generalizes the spectral sequence given by Lee and Gornik.

redistribution of the occupation of single particle energy levels: the holes
near the top of the band were proposed to all condense to the bottom of the
band. Here we consider a less drastic redistribution involving electrons with a
definite spin chirality and show that it is in fact energetically favored by
the Coulomb exchange matrix element $J$ over the scenario proposed earlier. It
is shown that spin splitting with chiral states reduces the Coulomb repulsion
and hence that the Coulomb repulsion promotes spin splitting. Superconductors
are proposed to possess a spin-split hole `core' at the bottom of the
electronic conduction band in addition to a spin-split Fermi surface. The new
scenario leads naturally to the existence of a spin current in the
superconducting state and is consistent with the Spin Meissner effect and
negative charge expulsion discussed earlier within the theory of hole
superconductivity.

paths from the identity transformation and corresponding straight words in the
Cayley graph of a finite transformation semigroup with a fixed generator set.
Of special interest are words that permute a given subset of the state set.
Certain such words, called minimal permutators, are shown to comprise a code,
and the straight ones comprise a finite code. Thus, words that permute a given
subset are uniquely factorizable as products of the subset's minimal
permutators, and these can be further reduced to straight minimal permutators.
This leads to insight into structure of local pools of reversibility in
transformation semigroups in terms of the set of words permuting a given
subset. These findings can be exploited in practical calculations for
hierarchical decompositions of finite automata. As an example we consider
groups arising in biological systems.

relaxation of the sample surface. Samples as short as 15 nm (7.5 nm in
diameter) form dominant shear bands during deformation. The elastic energy
release during plastic deformation is sufficient to provide the excess
potential energy required for the shear band nucleation at rather small sample
sizes. The results show that shear band formation is almost size-independent

Given information
about what does not constitute a solution, closed choice determines a solution.
We show that with closed choice one can characterize several models of
hypercomputation in a uniform framework using Weihrauch reducibility. The
classes of functions which are reducible to closed choice of the singleton
space, of the natural numbers, of Cantor space and of Baire space correspond to
the class of computable functions, of functions computable with finitely many
mind changes, of weakly computable functions and of effectively Borel
measurable functions, respectively. We also prove that all these classes
correspond to classes of non-deterministically computable functions with the
respective spaces as advice spaces. Moreover, we prove that closed choice on
Euclidean space can be considered as ""locally compact choice"" and it is
obtained as product of closed choice on the natural numbers and on Cantor
space. We also prove a Quotient Theorem for compact choice which shows that
single-valued functions can be ""divided"" by compact choice in a certain sense.
Another result is the Independent Choice Theorem, which provides a uniform
proof that many choice principles are closed under composition. Finally, we
also study the related class of low computable functions, which contains the
class of weakly computable functions as well as the class of functions
computable with finitely many mind changes. As one main result we prove a
uniform version of the Low Basis Theorem that states that closed choice on
Cantor space (and the Euclidean space) is low computable. We close with some
related observations on the Turing jump operation and its initial topology.

feasibility of increasing its current data-rate. In many classes of networks,
any one link's data-rate primarily impacts its neighbors and this impact decays
with distance. Hence, local exchanges can provide the information needed to
determine feasibility. Along these lines, the paper discusses the potential use
of existing physical-layer control messages to determine feasibility. This can
be considered as a technique analogous to carrier sensing in CSMA (Carrier

suggests that clusters get eroded or dispersed in a regular way over time, such
that the cluster number decreases inversely as an approximate power law with T
within each fixed interval of M. This power law is inconsistent with standard
dispersal mechanisms such as cluster evaporation and cloud collisions. In the
conventional interpretation, it requires the unlikely situation where diverse
mechanisms stitch together over time in a way that is independent of
environment or M. Here we consider another model in which the large scale
distribution of gas in each star-forming region plays an important role. We
note that star clusters form with positional and temporal correlations in giant
cloud complexes, and suggest that these complexes dominate the tidal force and
collisional influence on a cluster during its first several hundred million
years. Because the cloud complex density decreases regularly with position from
the cluster birth site, the harassment and collision rates between the cluster
and the cloud pieces decrease regularly with age as the cluster drifts. This
decrease is typically a power law of the form required to explain the mass-age
distribution. We reproduce this distribution for a variety of cases, including
rapid disruption, slow erosion, combinations of these two, cluster-cloud
collisions, cluster disruption by hierarchical disassembly, and partial cluster
disruption. We also consider apparent cluster mass loss by fading below the
surface brightness limit of a survey. In all cases, the observed log M - \log T

self-adjoint Hamiltonian can contain regular and singular (at the point ${\bf
r}=0$) square-integrable functions on the half-line with measure $rdr$. We
argue that the physical reason of the existence of singular functions is the
additional attractive potential, which appear due to the interaction between
the spin magnetic moment of fermion and Aharonov--Bohm magnetic field. The
scattering amplitude and cross section are obtained for spin-polarized
electrons scattered by the Aharonov--Bohm field. It is shown that in some range
of the extension parameter there appears a bound state. Since the Hamiltonian
of the nonrelativistic Dirac--Pauli equation for a massive neutral fermion with
the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) in the electric field of a linear charge
aligned perpendicularly to the fermion motion has the form of the Hamiltonian
for the Pauli equation in the Aharonov--Bohm flux tube, we also calculate the
scattering amplitude and cross section for the neutral fermion.

methodology and efficient instrumental support in order to early detect and
correct anomalies in the functional and non-functional properties of the tested
protocols. Among the various tools used to provide experimental support for
such developments, network emulation relies on real-time production of
impairments on real traffic according to a communication model, either
realistically or not.
  This paper aims at simply presenting to newcomers in network emulation
(students, engineers, ...) basic principles and practices illustrated with a
few commonly used tools. The motivation behind is to fill a gap in terms of
introductory and pragmatic papers in this domain.
  The study particularly considers centralized approaches, allowing cheap and
easy implementation in the context of research labs or industrial developments.
In addition, an architectural model for emulation systems is proposed, defining
three complementary levels, namely hardware, impairment and model levels. With
the help of this architectural framework, various existing tools are situated
and described. Various approaches for modeling the emulation actions are
studied, such as impairment-based scenarios and virtual architectures,
real-time discrete simulation and trace-based systems. Those modeling
approaches are described and compared in terms of services and we study their
ability to respond to various designer needs to assess when emulation is
needed.

common feature of the landscape of type IIB string theory. If a throat is
heated during cosmological evolution, energy is subsequently transferred to
other throats and to the standard model. We calculate the heat transfer rate
and the decay rate of throat-localized Kaluza-Klein states in a ten-dimensional
model. For the calculation, we employ the dual description of the throats in
terms of gauge theories. We discuss modifications of the decay rate which arise
in flux compactifications and for Klebanov-Strassler throats and emphasize the
role of tachyonic scalars in such throats in mediating decays of Kaluza-Klein
modes. Our results are also applicable to the energy transfer from the heated
standard model to throats. We determine the resulting energy density in throats
at our epoch in dependence of their infrared scales and of the reheating
temperature. The Kaluza-Klein modes in the throats decay to other sectors with
a highly suppressed rate. If their lifetime is longer than the age of the
universe, they are an interesting dark matter candidate. We show that, if the
reheating temperature was 10^10 - 10^11 GeV, throats with infrared scales in
the range of 10^5 GeV to 10^10 GeV can account for the observed dark matter. We
identify several scenarios where this type of dark matter is sufficiently
stable but where decays to the standard model can be discovered via gamma-ray

After briefly reviewing inflation, supersymmetry and supergravity, we first
study the scattering of massive W bosons in the thermal bath of particles,
during the period of reheating. It is found that the process generates in the
cross section terms which eventually lead to unitarity breaking above a certain
scale. This happens by virtue of the supergravity vertex. We show that the
longitudinal polarizations of the on-shell W become strongly interacting in the
high energy limit, and that the inclusion of diagrams with off-shell scalars of
the MSSM does not cancel the divergences. Next, we consider the dynamics and
the decay into gravitinos of a scalar field S, which starts oscillating in its
potential at the end of inflation. We embed S in a model of gauge mediation
with metastable vacua, where the hidden sector is of the O'Raifeartaigh type.
By demanding that the gravitinos thus produced provide with the observed Cold

that it is easy to account for gravitino Dark Matter with an arbitrarily low

and of the energy-momentum tensor are obtained, for a massive scalar field with
an arbitrary curvature coupling parameter, in the region between two infinite
parallel plates, on the background of de Sitter spacetime. The field is
prepared in the Bunch-Davies vacuum state and is constrained to satisfy Robin
boundary conditions on the plates. For the calculation, a mode-summation method
is used, supplemented with a variant of the generalized Abel-Plana formula.
This allows to explicitly extract the contributions to the expectation values
which come from each single boundary, and to expand the second-plate-induced
part in terms of exponentially convergent integrals. Several limiting cases of
interest are then studied. Moreover, the Casimir forces acting on the plates
are evaluated, and it is shown that the curvature of the background spacetime
decisively influences the behavior of these forces at separations larger than
the curvature scale of de Sitter spacetime. In terms of the curvature coupling
parameter and the mass of the field, two very different regimes are realized,
which exhibit monotonic and oscillatory behavior of the vacuum expectation
values, respectively. The decay of the Casimir force at large plate separation
is shown to be power-law (monotonic or oscillating), with independence of the

single central massive object if cooling is suppressed. Line cooling by
molecular hydrogen can be suppressed in the presence of a strong
soft-ultraviolet radiation field, but the role played by other cooling
mechanisms is less clear. In optically thin gas, Lyman-Alpha cooling can be
very effective, maintaining the gas temperature below 10^4 K over many orders
of magnitude in density. However, the large neutral hydrogen column densities
present in primordial galaxies render them highly optically thick to
Lyman-Alpha photons. In this letter, we examine in detail the effects of the
trapping of these Lyman-Alpha photons on the thermal and chemical evolution of
the gas. We show that despite the high optical depth in the Lyman series lines,
cooling is not strongly suppressed, and proceeds via other atomic hydrogen
transitions, in particular the 2s-1s and the 3-2 transitions. At densities
larger than 10^9 cm^{-3}, collisional dissociation of molecular hydrogen
becomes the dominant cooling process and decreases the gas temperature to about
5000 K. The gas temperature evolves with density as $T \propto
\rho^{\gamma_{\rm eff} - 1}$, with $\gamma_{\rm eff} = 0.97-0.98$. The
evolution is thus very close to isothermal, and so fragmentation is possible,
but unlikely to occur during the initial collapse. However, after the formation
of a massive central object, we expect that later-infalling, higher angular
momentum material will form an accretion disk that may be unstable to
fragmentation, which may give rise to star formation with a top-heavy IMF.

two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction
(RSOI), one-dimensional weak electric modulation and a perpendicular magnetic
field. The intra-Landau-band magnetoplasmon spectrum is determined in the
presence of spin-orbit interaction within the self consistent field approach at
finite temperature. Due to Rashba effect, the spin of finite-momentum electrons
feels a magnetic field perpendicular to the electron momentum in the inversion
plane. The magnetoplasmon spectrum of the modulated two-dimensional electron
gas (M2DEG) system is found to exhibit beating of Weiss oscillations due to
Rashba effect which is the focus of this work. This effect is absent in the
magnetoplasmon spectrum of M2DEG if Rashba spin-orbit interaction is not taken
into account. In addition, our finite temperature theory ficilitates analysis
of effects of temperature on the magnetoplasmon spectrum of M2DEG in the
presence of RSOI. We find that the beating pattern is damped but continues to
persist at a finite but low temperature.

become more aspherical in the central 50% of their host's virial radius, the

subhaloes at pericentre move too fast for the alignment signal to respond.

recent experiments. Furthermore, the contributions of the different noise
effects that influence the polariton ground state statistics are explicitly
defined. Exploiting the equivalence between Fokker-Planck and Langevin
descriptions of stochastic processes, the time dependent correlations of the
polaritons close to the stationary state are derived. Explicit expressions for
the linewidth and for the relaxation rate of the polariton intensity are
obtained, whose values are of the same order of magnitude of the experimental
data. Finally, the limit of validity of the truncated Wigner method in the
present model is discussed.

recently been carried out for various $PT$-symmetric theories, in both quantum

making possible an independent check of these approximate results. We do so by
numerically evaluating the ground-state wave-function for the equivalent

metric operator, to calculate the one- and two-point Green functions. We find
that the Green functions evaluated by lowest-order truncation of the

pole field, from the Concordia station, Dome C, Antarctica. The instrument
consists of a thermalized 10 cm refractor observing a fixed 3.88\degree x
3.88\degree field of view to perform photometry of several thousand stars at
visible wavelengths (700-900 nm). The first winter campaign in 2008 led to the
retrieval of nearly 1600 hours of data. We derive the fraction of photometric
nights by measuring the number of detectable stars in the field. The method is
sensitive to the presence of small cirrus clouds which are invisible to the
naked eye. The fraction of night-time for which at least 50% of the stars are
detected is 74% from June to September 2008. Most of the lost time (18.5% out
of 26%) is due to periods of bad weather conditions lasting for a few days
(""white outs""). Extended periods of clear weather exist. For example, between
July 10 and August 10, 2008, the total fraction of time (day+night) for which
photometric observations were possible was 60%. This confirms the very high
quality of Dome C for nearly continuous photometric observations during the
Antarctic winter.

  twin primes?",,,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main result of the paper is that assuming that the level $\theta$ of
distribution of primes exceeds 1/2, then there exists a positive $d\leq
C(\theta)$ such that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions with
the property that $p'=p+d$ is the next prime for each element of the
progression. If $\theta>0.971$, then the above holds for some $d\leq 16$.

  Fallah","An Inverse Optimality Method to Solve a Class of Optimal Control
  Problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents an inverse optimality method to solve the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for a class of nonlinear problems for which
the cost is quadratic and the dynamics are affine in the input. The method is
inverse optimal because the running cost that renders the control input optimal
is also explicitly determined. One special feature of this work, as compared to
other methods in the literature, is the fact that the solution is obtained
directly for the control input. The value function can also be obtained after
one solves for the control input. Furthermore, a Lyapunov function that proves
at least local stability of the controller is also obtained. In this regard the
main contribution of this paper can be interpreted in two different ways:
offering an analytical expression for Lyapunov functions for a class of
nonlinear systems and obtaining an optimal controller for the same class of
systems using a specific optimization functional. We also believe that an
additional contribution of this paper is to identify explicit classes of
systems and optimization functionals for which optimal control problems can be
solved analytically. In particular, for second order systems three cases are
identified: i) control input only as a function of the second state variable,
ii) control input affine in the second state variable when the dynamics are
affine in that variable and iii) control input affine in the first state
variable when the dyamics are affine in that variable. The relevance of the
proposed methodology is illustrated in several examples, including the Van der
Pol oscillator, mass-spring systems and vehicle path following.

resonance (ESR) and magnetization in high magnetic fields up to about 68 T of
the quasi two-dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$.
  From the temperature evolution of the ESR absorption linewidth, we find a
distinct disturbing of the development of the spin correlation by
$Z_2$-vortices between 23 K and 8.5 K. Below $T_{\rm{v}}=8.5$ K, spin-wave
calculations based on a 57$^{\circ}$ spiral spin order well explains the
frequency dependence of the ESR resonance fields and high field magnetization
processes for $H$$\parallel$$c$ and $H$$\perp$$c$, although the magnetization
for $H$$\perp$$c$ at high fields is different from the calculated one.
Furthermore, we explain the field independent specific heat with
$T^2$-dependence by the same spin-wave calculation, but the magnitude of the
specific heat is much less than the observed one. Accordingly, these results
suggest the occurrence of a $Z_2$ vortex-induced topological transition at
$T_{\rm{v}}$ and may indicate quantum effects beyond the descriptions based on
the above classical spin models.
