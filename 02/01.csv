hiding asymptotical capacity of steganographic systems is not attained by
algorithms developed so far. In this paper, we describe a novel coding method
based on Z2Z4-linear codes that conforms to +/-1-steganography, that is secret
data is embedded into a cover message by distorting each symbol by one unit at
most. This method solves some problems encountered by the most efficient
methods known today, based on ternary Hamming codes. Finally, the performance
of this new technique is compared with that of the mentioned methods and with
the well-known theoretical upper bound.

available automatic techniques to mine data regions and data records from web

a novel method to identify and extract the flat and nested data records from

Identification and Extraction of the data regions based on visual clues
information. (2) Identification and extraction of flat and nested data records
from the data region of a web page automatically. For step1, a novel and more
effective method is proposed, which finds the data regions formed by all types
of tags using visual clues. For step2, a more effective and efficient method
namely, Visual Clue based Extraction of web Data (VCED), is proposed, which
extracts each record from the data region and identifies it whether it is a
flat or nested data record based on visual clue information the area covered by
and the number of data items present in each record. Our experimental results
show that the proposed technique is effective and better than existing

takes d^{k^2}-time. Our structure theorem essentially says that the number of
independent variables in a real depth-3 identity is very small. This theorem
settles affirmatively the stronger rank conjectures posed by Dvir-Shpilka (STOC

that actually beats all known rank bounds and hence gives the best running time
(for every field) for black-box identity tests.
  Our main theorem (almost optimally) pins down the relation between higher
dimensional Sylvester-Gallai theorems and the rank of depth-3 identities in a
very transparent manner. The existence of this was hinted at by Dvir-Shpilka
(STOC 2005), but first proven, for reals, by Kayal-Saraf (FOCS 2009). We

prove the first ever theorem about high dimensional Sylvester-Gallai
configurations over any field. Our proofs and techniques are very different
from previous results and devise a very interesting ensemble of combinatorics
and algebra. The latter concepts are ideal theoretic and involve a new Chinese
remainder theorem. Our proof methods explain the structure of any depth-3

$r<d$, the number of vertices of the sum can potentially be as high as the
product of the number of vertices in each summand. However, the number of
vertices for sums of more polytopes was unknown so far. In this paper, we study
sums of polytopes in general orientations, and show a linear relation between
the number of faces of a sum of $r$ polytopes in dimension $d$, with $r\geq d$,
and the number of faces in the sums of less than $d$ of the summand polytopes.
We deduce from this exact formula a tight bound on the maximum possible number
of vertices of the Minkowski sum of any number of polytopes in any dimension.
In particular, the linear relation implies that a sum of $r$ polytopes in
dimension $d$ has a number of vertices in $O(n^{d-1})$ of the total number of
vertices in the summands, even when $r\geq d$. This bound is tight, in the
sense that some sums do have that many vertices.

dynamic range as high as eight to nine orders of magnitude. Therefore this
device is well suitable for medical imaging or applications such as small angle
x-ray scattering, where the requirements on the dynamic of the detector are
exceptional high. Basically the described detector is an ionization chamber
adapted to fan beam geometry with an active area of 192 cm and a pitch of the
anode strips of 150 micrometer. In the vertical direction beams as high as 10
mm can be accepted. Every read-out strip is connected to an analogue
integrating electronics channel realized in a custom made VLSI chip. A MicroCAT
structure utilized as a shielding grid enables frame rates as high as 10kHz.
The high dynamic range observed stems from the fact that the MicroCAT enables
active electron amplification in the gas. Thus a single photon resolution can
be obtained for low photon fluxes even with the integrating electronics. The
specialty of this device is that for each photon flux the gas amplification can
be adjusted in such a fashion that the maximum DQE value is achieved.

and at the top of atmosphere of a general planetary body. Using 2D fields at
the top of atmosphere alone, we derive lower bounds to the rate of material
entropy production and to the intensity of the Lorenz energy cycle. By
introducing a measure of the efficiency of the planetary system with respect to
horizontal thermodynamical processes, we provide insight on a previous
intuition on the possibility of defining a baroclinic heat engine extracting
work from the meridional heat flux. The approximate formula of the material
entropy production is verified and used for studying the global thermodynamic
properties of climate models (CMs) included in the PCMDI/CMIP3 dataset in
pre-industrial climate conditions. It is found that about 90% of the material
entropy production is due to vertical processes such as convection, whereas the
large scale meridional heat transport contributes only about 10%. The total
material entropy production is typically 55 mWK-1m-2, with discrepancies of the
order of 5% and CMs' baroclinic efficiencies are clustered around 0.055. When
looking at the variability and co-variability of the considered thermodynamical
quantities, the agreement among CMs is worse, suggesting that the description
of feedbacks is more uncertain.

bounded primitive. We compute the Rabinowitz Floer homology of energy
hypersurfaces $\Sigma_{k}=H^{-1}(k)$ of mechanical (kinetic energy + potential)
Hamiltonians $H$ for the case when the energy value k is greater than the Mane
critical value c.
  Under the stronger condition that k>c_{0}, where c_{0} denotes the strict

Floer homology of such hypersurfaces, by means of a short exact sequence of

their results to the weaker case k>c, thus covering cases where $\sigma$ is not

  As a consequence, we deduce that the hypersurface corresponding to the energy
level k is never displaceable for any k>c. Moreover, we prove that if dim M >

the metric is chosen generically, a generic Hamiltonian diffeomorphism has

around it, evaluated for all metric functions, covariant scalars (local and

robust recovery results of Cand\`es, Romberg and Tao, and of Donoho. These
results guarantee that if a uniform quantizer of step size $\delta$ is used to
quantize $m$ measurements $y = \Phi x$ of a $k$-sparse signal $x \in \R^N$,
where $\Phi$ satisfies the restricted isometry property, then the approximate
recovery $x^#$ via $\ell_1$-minimization is within $O(\delta)$ of $x$. The
simplest and commonly assumed approach is to quantize each measurement
independently. In this paper, we show that if instead an $r$th order
$\Sigma\Delta$ quantization scheme with the same output alphabet is used to
quantize $y$, then there is an alternative recovery method via Sobolev dual
frames which guarantees a reduction of the approximation error by a factor of
$(m/k)^{(r-1/2)\alpha}$ for any $0 < \alpha < 1$, if $m \gtrsim_r k (\log

part of the QNM is related to the adiabatic invariance of the system and also
to the entropy, surprisingly the mass parameter do not appear in the entropy

a liquid crystal confined between two parallel plates a distance H apart. The
plates are neutral and do not impose any anchoring on the particles. Depending
on the shape of the pair potential acting between the particles, we find that
the transition either changes from first-order to continuous at a critical film
thickness H=Hx, or that the transition remains first-order irrespective of H.
This demonstrates that the isotropic-to-nematic transition in confined geometry
is not characterized by any universality class, but rather that its fate is
determined by microscopic details. The resulting capillary phase diagrams can
thus assume two topologies: one where the isotropic and nematic branches of the
binodal meet at H=Hx, and one where they remain separated. For values of H
where the transition is strongly first-order the shift DT of the transition
temperature is in excellent agreement with the Kelvin equation. Not only is the
relation DT~1/H recovered but also the prefactor of the shift is in
quantitative agreement with the independently measured bulk latent heat and
interfacial tension.

hysteresis agrees with the recently proposed model of the surface spin-valve,
where the spin orientation at the interface can be different from that in the
bulk of the film. The switching in magneto-resistance at low fields is observed
to depend significantly on the direction of the exchange pinning, which allows
identifying this transition as a reversal of interior spins of the pinned
ferromagnetic films. The switching at higher fields is thus due to a spin
reversal in the point contact core, at the top surface of the ferromagnet, and
does not exhibit any clear field offset when the exchange-pinning direction or
the magnetic field direction is varied. This magnitude of the switching field
of the surface spins varies substantially from contact to contact and sometimes
from sweep to sweep, which suggests that the surface coercivity can change
under very high current densities and/or due to the particular microstructure
of the point contact. In contrast, no changes in the effect of the exchange
biasing on the interior spins are observed at high currents, possibly due to
the rapid drop in the current density away from nanometer sized point contact
cores.

phase transitions. One of the most important examples of these can be found
among the random k-satisfiability problems (often referred to as k-SAT), asking
whether there exists an assignment of Boolean values satisfying a Boolean
formula composed of clauses with k random variables each. The random 3-SAT
problem is reported to show various phase transitions at different critical
values of the ratio of the number of clauses to the number of variables. The
most famous of these occurs when the probability of finding a satisfiable
instance suddenly drops from 1 to 0. This transition is associated with a rise
in the hardness of the problem, but until now the correlation between any of
the proposed phase transitions and the hardness is not totally clear. In this
paper we will first show numerically that the number of solutions universally
follows a lognormal distribution, thereby explaining the puzzling question of
why the number of solutions is still exponential at the critical point.
Moreover we provide evidence that the hardness of the closely related problem
of counting the total number of solutions does not show any phase
transition-like behavior. This raises the question of whether the probability
of finding a satisfiable instance is really an order parameter of a phase
transition or whether it is more likely to just show a simple sharp threshold
phenomenon. More generally, this paper aims at starting a discussion where a
simple sharp threshold phenomenon turns into a genuine phase transition.

of simple totally disconnected locally compact groups. It is desirable to
understand the connections between the global and local structure of such a

class of a vertex stabiliser; on the other hand, the action on the tree
suggests that the local structure should correspond to the local action of a
stabiliser of a vertex on its neighbours.
  We study the interplay between these different aspects for the special class
of groups satisfying Tits' independence property. We show that such a group has
few open subgroups if and only if it acts locally primitively. Moreover, we
show that it always admits many germs of automorphisms which do not extend to
automorphisms, from which we deduce a negative answer to a question by George
Willis. Finally, under suitable assumptions, we compute the full group of germs
of automorphisms; in some specific cases, these turn out to be simple and
compactly generated, thereby providing a new infinite family of examples which

from 3D to 2D. Although dipolar relaxation generally increases as a function of
a static magnetic field intensity, we find a range of non-zero magnetic field
intensities where dipolar relaxation is strongly reduced. We use this resonant
reduction to accurately determine the S=6 scattering length of chromium atoms:
$a_6 = 103 \pm 4 a_0$. We compare this new measurement to another new
determination of $a_6$, which we perform by analysing the precise spectroscopy
of a Feshbach resonance in d-wave collisions, yielding $a_6 = 102.5 \pm 0.4
a_0$. These two measurements provide by far the most precise determination of
$a_6$ to date. We then show that, although dipolar interactions are long-range
interactions, dipolar relaxation only involves the incoming partial wave $l=0$
for large enough magnetic field intensities, which has interesting consequences
on the stability of dipolar Fermi gases. We then study ultra-cold chromium
gases in a 1D optical lattice resulting in a collection of independent 2D
gases. We show that dipolar relaxation is modified when the atoms collide in
reduced dimensionality at low magnetic field intensities, and that the
corresponding dipolar relaxation rate parameter is reduced by a factor up to 7

coupling arises naturally in interactions between light and a macroscopic

proposed interface is capable of transferring a state of light onto these
matter systems. The transfer itself is perfect and deterministic for any
quantum state, for arbitrarily small interaction strengths, and for arbitrarily
large noise of the target system. It requires an all-optical pre-processing,
requiring a coupling stronger than that between the light and the matter, and a
displacement feed-forward correction of the matter system. We also suggest a
probabilistic version of the interface, which eliminates the need for the
feed-forward correction at a cost of reduced success rate. An application of
the interface can be found in construction of a quantum memory, or in the state
preparation for quantum sensing.

field. Such a field is large for the polar benzene-dithiol molecule, resulting
in a transmission spectrum shifted by about 0.6 eV with respect to that of the

negligible, so that the average transmission spectrum of wet Au/CNT/Au

micro-structuring results in a transition in the suspensions' rheological
behavior, from a Newtonian-like behavior to a shear-thinning rheology with a
significant yield stress. This behavior is studied as a function of particle
volume fraction and strength of the applied electric field, $E$. The steady
shear flow curves are observed to scale onto a master curve with respect to
$E$, in a manner similar to what was recently found for suspensions of laponite
clay [42]. In the case of Na-fluorohectorite, the corresponding dynamic yield
stress is demonstrated to scale with respect to $E$ as a power law with an
exponent $\alpha \sim 1.93$, while the static yield stress inferred from
constant shear stress tests exhibits a similar behavior with $\alpha \sim
1.58$. The suspensions are also studied in the framework of thixotropic fluids:
the bifurcation in the rheology behavior when letting the system flow and
evolve under a constant applied shear stress is characterized, and a
bifurcation yield stress, estimated as the applied shear stress at which
viscosity bifurcation occurs, is measured to scale as $E^\alpha$ with $\alpha
\sim 0.5$ to 0.6. All measured yield stresses increase with the particle
fraction $\Phi$ of the suspension. For the static yield stress, a scaling law
$\Phi^\beta$, with $\beta = 0.54$, is found. The results are found to be
reasonably consistent with each other. Their similarities with-, and
discrepancies to- results obtained on laponite-oil suspensions are discussed.

higher dimensions using a renormalisation group improvement of the metric. The
quantum effects are worked out in detail for asymptotically safe gravity, where
the short distance physics is characterized by a non-trivial fixed point of the
gravitational coupling. We find that a weakening of gravity implies a decrease
of the event horizon, and the existence of a Planck-size black hole remnant
with vanishing temperature and vanishing heat capacity. The absence of
curvature singularities is generic and discussed together with the conformal
structure and the Penrose diagram of asymptotically safe black holes. The
production cross section of mini-black holes in energetic particle collisions,
such as those at the Large Hadron Collider, is analysed within low-scale
quantum gravity models. Quantum gravity corrections imply that cross sections
display a threshold, are suppressed in the Planckian, and reproduce the
semi-classical result in the deep trans-Planckian region. Further implications
are discussed.

to realize a global optimization of a deep drawing industrial progression (made
of several stages) for a cup manufacture. The objectives of the process were
the thickness decrease and the geometrical parameters (especially the height).
This paper improves on this previous work in the aim of mastering the contour
error. From the optimal configuration, we expect to cut down the amount of the
needed material and the number of forming operations. Our action is focused on
the appearance of unexpected undulations (ears) located on the rim of the cups
during forming due to a nonuniform crystallographic texture. Those undulations
can cause a significant amount of scraps, productivity loss, and cost during
manufacture. In this paper, this phenomenon causes the use of four forming
operations for the cup manufacture. The aim is to cut down from four to two
forming stages by defining an optimal blank (size and shape). The advantage is
to reduce the cost of the tool manufacturing and to minimize the needed
material (by suppressing the part flange). The chosen approach consists in
defining a particular description of the ears' part by modal decomposition and
then simulating several blank shapes and sizes generated by discrete cosine
transformation (DCT). The use of a numerical simulation for the forming
operation and the design of an experiment technique allow mathematical links
between the ears' formation and the DCT coefficients. An optimization is then
possible by using mathematical links. This original approach leads the ears'
amplitude to be reduced by a factor of 10, with only 15 numerical experiments.
Moreover, we have limited the number of forming stages from 4 to 2 with a
minimal material use.

(upper troposphere and stratosphere) is dominated by the presence of a vortex

vortex is characterized by a strong cyclonic jet centered above the polar high.
In a recent study of our group (Hagelin et al., 2008) of four different sites
in the Antarctic internal plateau (South Pole, Dome C, Dome A and Dome F), it
was made the hypothesis that the wind speed strength in the upper atmosphere
should be related to the distance of the site to the center of the Antarctic
polar vortex. This high altitude wind is very important from an astronomical
point of view since it might trigger the onset of the optical turbulence and
strongly affect other optical turbulence parameters. What we are interested in
here is to localize the position of the minimum value of the wind speed at high
altitude in order to confirm the hypothesis of Hagelin et al. (2008).

the leftmost site at rate $\alpha$, hop to the right at unit rate, and are
removed at the rightmost site at rate $\beta$. Our study is motivated by recent
experiments on colloidal particles in optical tweezer arrays. The external
potential is of the form generated by such an array. Particles spend most of
the time near potential minima, approximating the situation in the lattice gas;
a short-range repulsive interaction prevents two particles from occupying the
same potential well. A constant driving force, representing Stokes drag on
particles suspended in a moving fluid, leads to biased motion. Our results for
the density profile and current, obtained via numerical integration of the
Langevin equation and dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, indicate that the
continuous-space model exhibits phase transitions analogous to those observed
in the lattice model. The correspondence is not exact, however, due to the lack
of particle-hole symmetry in our model.

behaviour which has been abstracted to form the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA).
In algorithmic terms, individual DCs perform multi-sensor data fusion,
asynchronously correlating the the fused data signals with a secondary data
stream. Aggregate output of a population of cells, is analysed and forms the
basis of an anomaly detection system. In this paper the DCA is applied to the
detection of outgoing port scans using TCP SYN packets. Results show that
