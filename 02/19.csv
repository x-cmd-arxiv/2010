shear measurements to constrain dark energy. We quantify the importance of
uncalibrated photometric redshift outliers to the dark energy goals of
forthcoming imaging surveys in a manner that does not assume any particular
photometric redshift technique or template. In so doing, we provide an
approximate blueprint for computing the influence of specific outlier
populations on dark energy constraints. We find that outliers whose photo-z
distributions are tightly localized about a significantly biased redshift must
be controlled to a per-galaxy rate of <~ a few times 10^-3 to insure that
systematic errors on dark energy parameters are rendered negligible. In the
complementary limit, a subset of imaged galaxies with uncalibrated photometric
redshifts distributed over a broad range must be limited to fewer than a
per-galaxy error rate of <~ a few times 10^-4. Additionally, we explore the
relative importance of calibrating the photo-z's of a core set of relatively
well-understood galaxies as compared to the need to identify potential
catastrophic photo-z outliers. We discuss the degradation of the statistical
constraints on dark energy parameters induced by excising source galaxies at
high- and low-photometric redshifts, concluding that removing galaxies with
z_phot >~ 2.4 and z_phot <~ 0.3 may mitigate damaging catastrophic redshift
outliers at a relatively small (~ 20%) cost in statistical error. In an
appendix, we show that forecasts for the degradation in dark energy parameter
constraints due to uncertain photometric redshifts depend sensitively on the
treatment of the nonlinear matter power spectrum. Previous work using PD96 may
have overestimated the photo-z calibration requirements of future surveys.

the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). Emission lines from metals in the UV
band are excellent tracers of the cooler fraction of this gas. We present
predictions for the surface brightness of a sample of UV lines that could
potentially be observed by the next generation of UV telescopes at z<1. We use
a subset of simulations from the OWLS project to create emission maps and to
investigate the effect of varying the physical prescriptions for star
formation, supernova and AGN feedback, chemodynamics and radiative cooling.
Most models produce results in agreement within a factor of a few, indicating
that the predictions are robust. Of the lines we consider, C III is the
strongest line, but it typically traces gas colder than 10^5 K. The same is
true for Si IV. The second strongest line, C IV, traces circum-galactic gas
with T~10^5 K. O VI and Ne VIII probe the warmer (T~10^5.5 K and T~10^6 K,
respectively) and more diffuse gas that may be a better tracer of the large
scale structure. N V emission is intermediate between C IV and O VI. The
intensity of all emission lines increases strongly with gas density and
metallicity, and for the bright emission it is tightly correlated with the
temperature for which the line emissivity is highest. In particular, the C III,
C IV, Si IV and O VI emission that is sufficiently bright to be potentially
detectable in the near future (>10^3 photon/s/cm^2/sr), comes from relatively
dense (rho>10^2 rho_mean) and metal rich (Z>0.1 Z_sun) gas. As such, emission
lines are highly biased tracers of the missing baryons and are not an optimal
tool to close the baryon budget. However, they do provide a powerful means to
detect the gas cooling onto or flowing out of galaxies and groups. (Abridged)

emission driven by radioactive decay. Our model includes an approximate
description of the time dependence of the opacity (due mainly to
recombination), and of the deviation of the emitted spectrum from a black body
spectrum. We show that the characteristics of the early UV/O emission constrain
the radius of the progenitor star, its envelope composition, and the ratio of
the ejecta energy to its mass, E/M. For He envelopes, neglecting the effect of
recombination may lead to an over estimate of progenitor radius by more than an
order of magnitude. We also show that the relative extinction at different
wavelengths may be inferred from the light-curves at these wave-lengths,
removing the uncertainty in the estimate of progenitor radius due to reddening
(but not the uncertainty in E/M due to uncertainty in absolute extinction). The
early UV/O observations of the type Ib SN2008D and of the type IIp SNLS-04D2dc
are consistent with our model predictions. For SN2008D we find progenitor

their atmospheres while theoretically it is not clear what prevents the dust
from settling and disappearing from the regions of spectrum formation.
Consequently, standard models have to rely on ad hoc assumptions about the
mechanism that keeps dust grains aloft in the atmosphere. We apply
hydrodynamical simulations to develop an improved physical understanding of the
mixing properties of macroscopic flows in M dwarf and brown dwarf atmospheres,
in particular of the influence of the underlying convection zone. We performed
2D radiation hydrodynamics simulations including a description of dust grain
formation and transport with the CO5BOLD code. The simulations cover the very
top of the convection zone and the photosphere including the dust layers for
effective temperatures between 900K and 2800K, all with logg=5 assuming solar
chemical composition. Convective overshoot occurs in the form of exponentially
declining velocities with small scale heights, so that it affects only the
region immediately above the almost adiabatic convective layers. From there on,
mixing is provided by gravity waves that are strong enough to maintain thin
dust clouds in the hotter models. With decreasing effective temperature, the
amplitudes of the waves become smaller but the clouds become thicker and
develop internal convective flows that are more efficient in mixing material
than gravity waves. The presence of clouds leads to a highly structured
appearance of the stellar surface on short temporal and small spatial scales.
We identify convectively excited gravity waves as an essential mixing process
in M dwarf and brown dwarf atmospheres. Under conditions of strong cloud
formation, dust convection is the dominant self-sustaining mixing component.

Such clumps of dark matter (DM) can be produced by many mechanisms, most
notably by spiky features in the spectrum of inflationary perturbations and by
cosmological phase transitions. Being produced very early during the radiation
dominated epoch, superdense clumps evolve as isolated objects. They do not
belong to hierarchical structures for a long time after production, and
therefore they are not destroyed by tidal interactions during the formation of
larger structures. For DM particles with masses close to the electroweak (EW)
mass scale, superdense clumps evolve towards a power-law density profile
$\rho(r) \propto r^{-1.8}$ with a central core. Superdense clumps cannot be
composed of standard neutralinos, since their annihilations would overproduce
the diffuse gamma radiation. If the clumps are constituted of superheavy DM
particles and develop a sufficiently large central density, the evolution of
their central part can lead to a 'gravithermal catastrophe.' In such a case,
the initial density profile turns into an isothermal profile with $\rho \propto
r^{-2}$ and a new, much smaller core in the center. Superdense clumps can be
bserved by gamma radiation from DM annihilations and by gravitational wave
detectors, while the production of primordial black holes and cascade
nucleosynthesis constrain this scenario.

clumps of all masses down to $\sim 260 m_\chi$ in the case of bino. If
small-scale clumps evolve from a non-standard, spiky spectrum of perturbations,
DM clumps may form during the radiation dominated era. These clumps are not
destroyed by tidal interactions and can be extremely dense. In the case of a
bino, a ""gravithermal catastrophe"" can develop in the central part of the most
dense clumps, increasing further the central density and thus the annihilation
signal. In the case of a higgsino, the annihilation signal is enhanced by the
Sommerfeld effect. As a result annihilations of superheavy neutralinos in dense

ultrahigh energy particles, for both cases, higgsinos and binos, as lightest

using high resolution (R=50000) optical absorption spectroscopy of a backgound
star that probes the envelope on a line of sight 35"" from the center. The metal
species that we detect in the envelope include NaI, KI, CaI, CaII, CrI, and
FeI, with upper limits for AlI, MnI, TiI, TiII, and SrII. The observations are
used to determine the metal abundances in the gas phase and the condensation
onto grains. The metal depletions range from a factor of 5 for Na to 300 for
Ca, with some similarity to the depletion pattern in interstellar clouds. Our
results directly constrain the condensation efficiency of metals in a
carbon-rich circumstellar envelope and the mix of solid and gas phase metals
returned by the star to the ISM. The abundances of the uncondensed metal atoms
that we observe are typically larger than the abundances of the metal-bearing
molecules detected in the envelope. The metal atoms are therefore the major
metal species in the gas phase and likely play a key role in the metal

a temperature floor for collapsing protostars that can regulate the process of

hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations, that the CMB temperature floor would
have influenced the majority of stars formed at redshifts between z=3 and 6,
and probably even to higher redshift. Five signatures of CMB-regulated star
formation are: (1) a higher supernova rate than currently predicted at high
redshift; (2) a systematic discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements
of the high redshift star formation rate; (3) a lack of surviving globular
clusters that formed at high metallicity and high redshift; (4) a more rapid
rise in the metallicity of cosmic gas than is predicted by current simulations;
and (5) an enhancement in the abundances of alpha elements such as O and Mg at
metallicities -2 < [Fe/H] < -0.5. Observations are not presently able to either
confirm or rule out the presence of these signatures. However, if correct, the
top-heavy IMF of high-redshift high-metallicity globular clusters could provide
an explanation for the observed bimodality of their metallicity distribution.

numerical computations, the extension of linear eigenmodes of the corresponding
linearized system into nonlinear states is established, particularly nonlinear
continuations of the fundamental state and the first excited state. The
(in)stability of the states is also numerically calculated, from which it is
obtained that symmetric nonlinear solutions become unstable beyond a critical
threshold norm. Instability of the symmetric states is then investigated
analytically through the application of a topological argument. Determination
of instability of positive symmetric states is reduced to simple geometric
properties of the composite phase plane orbit of the standing wave. Further the
topological argument is applied to higher excited states and instability is

The central
techniques applied in this paper are in part adopted from the theory of optimal
nonlinear control. Alternatively, the investigated approach can be considered
as a continuous time generalisation of what is known as weakly constrained four
dimensional variational assimilation (WC--4DVAR) in the geosciences. The
technique allows to assimilate trajectories in the case of partial observations
and in the presence of model error. Several mathematical aspects of the
approach are studied. Computationally, it amounts to solving a two point
boundary value problem. For imperfect models, the trade off between small
dynamical error (i.e. the trajectory obeys the model dynamics) and small
observational error (i.e. the trajectory closely follows the observations) is
investigated. For (nearly) perfect models, this trade off turns out to be
(nearly) trivial in some sense, yet allowing for some dynamical error is shown
to have positive effects even in this situation. The presented formalism is
dynamical in character; no assumptions need to be made about the presence (or
absence) of dynamical or observational noise, let alone about their statistics.

between parallel Dirichlet boundaries. We study corrections to this when the
boundaries themselves have apertures and edges. We consider several geometries:
a single plate with a slit in it, perpendicular plates separated by a gap, and
two parallel plates, one of which has a long slit of large width, related to
the case of one plate being semi-infinite. We develop a general formalism for
studying such problems, based on the wavefunctional for the field in the gap
between the plates. This formalism leads to a lower dimensional theory defined
on the open regions of the plates or boundaries. The Casimir energy is then
given in terms of the determinant of the nonlocal differential operator which
defines the lower dimensional theory. We develop perturbative methods for
computing these determinants. Our results are in good agreement with known
results based on Monte Carlo simulations. The method is well suited to
isolating the diffractive contributions to the Casimir energy.

two-terminal Aharonov-Bohm interferometer is an even function of the applied
magnetic flux. Away from linear response, however, this symmetry is not
fulfilled and the conductance phase of the interferometer when a quantum dot is
inserted in one of its arms can be a continuous function of the bias voltage.
Such magnetoasymmetries have been investigated in related mesoscopic systems
and arise as a consequence of the asymetric response of the internal potential
of the conductor out of equilibrium. Here we discuss magnetoasymmetries in
quantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm interferometers when strong electron-electron
interactions are taken into account beyond the mean-field approach. We find
that at very low temperatures the asymmetric element of the differential
conductance shows an abrupt change for voltages around the Fermi level. At
higher temperatures we recover a smooth variation of the magnetoasymmetry as a
function of the bias. We illustrate our results with the aid of the electron
occupation at the dot, demonstrating that its nonequilibrium component is an
asymmetric function of the flux even to lowest order in voltage. We also
calculate the magnetoasymmetry of the current-current correlations (the noise)
and find that it is given, to a good extent, by the magnetoasymmetry of the
weakly nonlinear conductance term. Therefore, both magnetoasymmetries (noise
and conductance) are related to each other via a higher-order
fluctuation-dissipation relation. This result appears to be true even in the
low temperature regime, where Kondo physics and many-body effects dominate the
transport properties.

Via the precise control of the deposition rate, a biaxial texture is favored
within a broad range of the deposition temperature. The full epitaxial
relationship between the borocarbide film, the \luo interface layer and the
substrate is (110)[001]MgO II (110)[001]Lu2O3 II (001)[100]LuNi2B2C. A very
sharp in--plane alignment of about 1\textdegree and an out--of--plane order of
about 2.5\textdegree was achieved in the \luni layer. However, a systematic
study using different deposition temperatures shows that the temperature is
crucial for phase formation and appealing superconducting properties. Applying
optimized deposition conditions, critical temperatures of up to 15.8 K and
steep superconducting transitions of about 0.3 K are reproducibly obtained. We
further analyzed the upper critical field Hc2 of one film deposited under
optimized conditions. It was resistively measured along the [001] direction and
fitted with a power law. The value of Hc2(0) = 9.82 T obtained from that fit is
in very good agreement with single crystal data and the power exponent

contamination from convective mixing that would mimic the high gravities. We
constrain this scenario by determining the helium abundances in six cool DA
white dwarfs using high-resolution spectra from the Keck I 10-m telescope. We
obtain no detections, with upper limits as low as He/H = 0.04 in some cases.
This allows us to put this scenario to rest for good. We also extend our model
grid to lower temperatures using improved Stark profiles with non-ideal gas

their measured cross-correlation function with ~46,000 Luminous Red Galaxies

the presence or absence of nodes, is still a question of debate. While
contradictory experiments can be explained by appropriately tuned theories of
nodeless superconductivity in the iron-arsenide compounds, for LaOFeP all
experiments clearly point to a nodal order parameter. We put forward a scenario
that naturally explains the difference between the order-parameter character in
these two sets of compounds, and use functional renormalization group (fRG)
techniques to analyze it in detail. Our results show that, due to the orbital
content of the electron and hole bands, nodal superconductivity on the electron
pockets (hole pocket gaps are always nodeless) can naturally appear when the
third hole pocket which lies at wavevector (pi,pi) in the unfolded Brillouin
zone is absent, as is the case in LaOFeP. When present, the third hole pocket
has overwhelming d_{xy} orbital character, and the intra-orbital interaction
with the d_{xy} dominated part of the electron Fermi surface is enough to drive
the superconductivity nodeless (of s^+- form). However, in its absence, pair
hopping, inter-orbital, and electron-electron intra-orbital interactions render
the gap on the electron pockets softly nodal.

engaging the neighboring mobile nodes in a simple but effective cooperation,
and by exploiting both the time-of-arrival (TOA) information (between mobile

iterative approach that can practically achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound.
Instead of using simplified channel models as in many previous studies, a
sophisticated and realistic channel model is used, which can effectively
account for the critical fact that the direct path is not necessarily the
strongest path. Extensive simulations are conducted in static and mobile
settings, and various practical issues and system parameters are evaluated. It
is shown that COTAR significantly outperforms the existing strategies,
achieving a localization accuracy of only a few tenths of a meter in clear

new physics beyond the standard models of cosmology and of particle physics. In
the standard, hot big bang cosmology, long before any stars have formed a
significant fraction (~25%) of the baryonic mass in the Universe should be in
the form of helium-4 nuclei. Since current 4He observations are restricted to
low redshift regions where stellar nucleosynthesis has occurred, observations
of high redshift, prestellar 4He would constitute a fundamental test of the
hot, big bang cosmology. At recombination, long after big bang nucleosynthesis
(BBN) has ended, the temperature anisotropy spectrum imprinted on the CMB
depends on the 4He abundance through its connection to the electron density and
the effect of the electron density on Silk damping. Since the relic abundance
of 4He is relatively insensitive to the universal density of baryons, but is
sensitive to a non-standard, early Universe expansion rate, the primordial mass
fraction of 4He, Yp, offers a test of the consistency of the standard models of
BBN and the CMB and, provides constraints on non-standard physics. Here, the
WMAP seven year data (supplemented by other CMB experiments), which lead to an
indirect determination of Yp at high redshift, are compared to the BBN
predictions and to the independent, direct observations of 4He in low redshift,
extragalactic HII regions. At present, given the very large uncertainties in
the CMB-determined primordial 4He abundance (as well as for the helium

from all the possible scenarios for the Universe, the preferred one by the best
estimated values of (\zeta_0, \zeta_1) is that of an expanding Universe
beginning with a Big- Bang, followed by a decelerated expansion at early times,
and with a smooth transition in recent times to an accelerated expansion epoch

little smaller than the mean value of the observational constraint coming from
the oldest globular clusters but it is still inside of the confidence interval
of this constraint. A drawback of the model is the violation of the local
second law of thermodynamics in redshifts z >= 1. However, when we assume
\zeta_1 = 0, the simple model \zeta = \zeta_0 evaluated at the best estimated
value for \zeta_0 satisfies the local second law of thermodynamics, the age of
the Universe is in perfect agreement with the constraint of globular clusters,
and it also has a Big-Bang, followed by a decelerated expansion with the smooth
transition to an accelerated expansion epoch in late times, that is going to

order based on its properties at the first order. The method of Zhang (2008) is
well defined mathematically. It does not require assumptions on the
morphologies of galaxies and the PSF. To reach a sub-percent level accuracy,
the CCD pixel size is required to be not larger than 1/3 of the Full Width at
Half Maximum (FWHM) of the PSF. Using a large ensemble (> 10^7) of mock
galaxies of unrestricted morphologies, we find that contaminations to the shear
signals from the noise of background photons can be removed in a well defined
way because they are not correlated with the source shapes. The residual shear
measurement errors due to background noise are consistent with zero at the
sub-percent level even when the amplitude of such noise reaches about 1/10 of
the source flux within the half-light radius of the source. This limit can in
principle be extended further with a larger galaxy ensemble in our simulations.
On the other hand, the source Poisson noise remains to be a cause of systematic
errors. For a sub-percent level accuracy, our method requires the amplitude of
the source Poisson noise to be less than 1/80 ~ 1/100 of the source flux within
the half-light radius of the source, corresponding to collecting roughly 10^4
source photons.

shear estimators from galaxy images. Conventional methods average over a single
quantity per galaxy to estimate each shear component. We show that any such
shear estimators must reduce to a highly nonlinear form when the galaxy image
is described by three parameters (pure ellipse), even in the absence of the
point spread function (PSF). In the presence of the PSF, we argue that this
class of shear estimators do not likely exist. Alternatively, we propose a new
way of measuring the cosmic shear: instead of averaging over a single value
from each galaxy, we average over two numbers, and then take the ratio to
estimate the shear component. In particular, the two numbers correspond to the
numerator and denominators which generate the quadrupole moments of the galaxy
image in Fourier space, as proposed in Zhang (2008). This yields a
statistically unbiased estimate of the shear component. Consequently,
measurements of the n-point spatial correlations of the shear fields should
also be modified: one needs to take the ratio of two correlation functions to
get the desired, unbiased shear correlation.

Virgo galaxies observed by the Chandra X-ray Telescope as part of the
AMUSE-Virgo survey, down to a (3sigma) limiting luminosity of 3.7E+38 erg/s
over 0.5-7 keV. The stellar mass distribution of the targeted sample, which is
mostly composed of formally `inactive' galaxies, peaks below 1E+10 M_Sun, a
regime where the very existence of nuclear super-massive black holes (SMBHs) is
debated. Out of 100 objects, 32 show a nuclear X-ray source, including 6 hybrid
nuclei which also host a massive nuclear cluster as visible from archival HST
images. After carefully accounting for contamination from nuclear low-mass
X-ray binaries based on the shape and normalization of their X-ray luminosity
function, we conclude that between 24-34% of the galaxies in our sample host a
X-ray active SMBH (at the 95% C.L.). This sets a firm lower limit to the black
hole occupation fraction in nearby bulges within a cluster environment. At face
value, the active fraction -down to our luminosity limit- is found to increase
with host stellar mass. However, taking into account selection effects, we find
that the average Eddington-scaled X-ray luminosity scales with black hole mass
as M_BH^(-0.62^{+0.13}_{-0.12}), with an intrinsic scatter of
0.46^({+0.08}_{-0.06}) dex. This finding can be interpreted as observational
evidence for `down-sizing' of black hole accretion in local early types, that
is, low mass black holes shine relatively closer to their Eddington limit than
higher mass objects. As a consequence, the fraction of active galaxies, defined
as those above a fixed X-ray Eddington ratio, decreases with increasing black
hole mass.

a strong light field is the principle mechanism for lasing in ""classical""
lasers. The onset of lasing is marked by a threshold which can be characterised
by a sharp increase in photon flux as a function of external pumping strength.
The same is not necessarily true for the fundamental building block of a laser:
a single trapped atom interacting with a single optical radiation mode. It has
been shown that such a ""quantum"" laser can exhibit thresholdless lasing in the
regime of strong coupling between atom and radiation field. However, although
theoretically predicted, a threshold at the single-atom level could not be
experimentally observed so far. Here, we demonstrate and characterise a
single-atom laser with and without threshold behaviour by changing the strength
of atom-light field coupling. We observe the establishment of a laser threshold
through the accumulation of photons in the optical mode even for a mean photon
number substantially lower than for the classical case. Furthermore,
self-quenching occurs for very strong external pumping and constitutes an
intrinsic limitation of single-atom lasers. Moreover, we find that the
statistical properties of the emitted light can be adjusted for weak external
pumping, from the quantum to the classical domain. Our observations mark an
important step towards fundamental understanding of laser operation in the
few-atom limit including systems based on semiconductor quantum dots or
molecules.

novel time-dependent supersymmetric quantum theory where the R-charge is
twisted along the time. The invariance of the supersymmetric index under
variations of the action for these theories leads to two predictions: In the IR
limit it predicts how the degeneracy of BPS states change as we cross the walls
of marginal stability. On the other hand, its equivalence with the UV limit
relates this to the spectrum of the U(1) R-charges of the Ramond ground states

decay polynomially fast in time with any rate. These results are constructive.
Additionally, we prove sharp constructive upper and lower bounds for the

we thus observe that a spectral gap exists only when $\gamma + 2s \ge 0$, as

(Meng and van Dyk 1997, 1998), are presented for ML estimation of mixture
proportions. The resulting algorithms inherit the simplicity, ease of
implementation, and monotonic convergence properties of EM, but have
considerably improved speed. Because conventional EM tends to be slow when
there exists a large overlap between the mixture components, we can improve the
speed without sacrificing the simplicity or stability, if we can reformulate
the problem so as to reduce the amount of overlap. We propose simple
""squeezing"" strategies for that purpose. Moreover, for high-dimensional
problems, such as computing the nonparametric MLE of the distribution function
with censored data, a natural and effective remedy for conventional EM is to
add exchange steps (based on improved EM) between adjacent mixture components,
where the overlap is most severe. Theoretical considerations show that the
resulting EM-type algorithms, when carefully implemented, are globally
convergent. Simulated and real data examples show dramatic improvement in speed
in realistic situations.

to single spiral galaxies in a control sample, only spiral galaxies in S+S
pairs show significantly enhanced specific star formation rate (sSFR=SFR/M),
whereas spiral galaxies in S+E pairs do not. Furthermore, the SFR enhancement
of spiral galaxies in S+S pairs is highly mass-dependent. Only those with $\rm
M \gsim 10^{10.5} M_\sun$ show significant enhancement. Relatively low mass
($\rm M \sim 10^{10} M_\sun$) spirals in S+S pairs have about the same SFR/M
compared to their counterparts in the control sample. There is evidence for a
correlation between the global star formation activities (but not the nuclear
activities) of the component galaxies in massive S+S major-merger pairs (the
""Holmberg effect""). There is no significant difference in the SFR/M between the
primaries and the secondaries, nor between spirals of SEP<1 and those of SEP.1.
The contribution of KPAIR galaxies to the cosmic SFR density in the local

simulation that uses cosmological parameters favored by current observations.
The Bolshoi simulation was done in a volume 250Mpc on a side using 8billion
particles with mass and force resolution adequate to follow subhalos down to a
completeness limit of Vcirc=50km/ s circular velocity. Using excellent
statistics of halos and subhalos (10M at every moment and 50M over the whole
history) we present accurate approximations for statistics such as the halo
mass function, the concentrations for distinct halos and subhalos, abundance of
halos as function of their circular velocity, the abundance and the spatial
distribution of subhalos. We find that at high redshifts the concentration
falls to a minimum of about 3.8 and then rises slightly for higher values of
halo mass. We find that while the Sheth-Tormen approximation for the mass
function of halos found by spherical overdensity is accurate at low redshifts,
it over-predicts the abundance of halos by nearly an order of magnitude by
z=10. We find that the number of subhalos scales with the circular velocity of
the host halo as Vhost**0.5, and that subhalos have nearly the same radial
distribution as dark matter particles at radii 0.3-2 times the host halo virial
radius. The subhalo velocity function n(>V) behaves as V**(-3). We give
normalization of this relation for different masses and redshifts. Finally, we
use an abundance-matching procedure to assign r-band luminosities to dark
matter halos as a function of halo Vcirc, and find that the luminosity-velocity
relation is in remarkably good agreement with the observed Tully-Fisher
relation for galaxies in the range 50-200km/s.

seven confirmed SGRs on March 5, 1979, August 27, 1998, and December 27, 2004.
The last two events were found to be much more powerful than the first, and
both showcased the existence of a precursor, that we show to have had initiated
the main flare. In the internal mechanism, we propose that the strongly wound
up poloidal magnetic field develops tangential discontinuities and dissipates
its torsional energy in heating the crust. The timescale for the instability to
develop coincides with the duration of the quiescent state that followed the
precursor. Alternatively, we develop a reconnection model based on the
hypothesis that shearing motion of the footpoints causes the materialization of
a Sweet-Parker current layer in the magnetosphere. The thinning of this
macroscopic layer due to the development of an embedded super-hot turbulent
current layer switches on the impulsive Hall reconnection, which powers the
giant flare. Again, we show that the thinning time is on the order of the
preflare quiescent time. This model naturally explains the origin of the
observed nonthermal radiation during the flares, as well as the post flare
radio afterglows.

that its approximation version is complete for (the promise version of) the

PCP Theorem for NP. Similar characterizations have been given for higher levels
of the Polynomial Hierarchy, and for PSPACE; however, we suggest that the
result for AM might be of particular significance for attempts to derandomize
this class.
  To test this notion, we pose some `Randomized Optimization Hypotheses'
related to our stochastic CSPs that (in light of our result) would imply
collapse results for AM. Unfortunately, the hypotheses appear over-strong, and
we present evidence against them. In the process we show that, if some language
in NP is hard-on-average against circuits of size 2^{Omega(n)}, then there
exist hard-on-average optimization problems of a particularly elegant form.
  All our proofs use a powerful form of PCPs known as Probabilistically
Checkable Proofs of Proximity, and demonstrate their versatility. We also use
known results on randomness-efficient soundness- and hardness-amplification. In
particular, we make essential use of the Impagliazzo-Wigderson generator; our
analysis relies on a recent Chernoff-type theorem for expander walks.

results show that the conductance is always larger than $e^{2}/h$ for the
parallel configuration of lead magnetizations, but for the antiparallel
configuration the conductance becomes zero because of the band-selective rule.
So a magnetoresistance (MR) plateau emerges with the value 100% when the Fermi
energy is located around the Dirac point. Besides, choosing narrower graphene
ribbons can obtain the wider 100% MR plateaus and the length change of the
central graphene region does not affect the 100% MR plateaus. Although the
disorder will reduce the MR plateau, the plateau value can be still kept about
50% even in a large disorder strength case. In addition, when the
magnetizations of the left and right leads have a relative angle, the
conductance changes as a cosine function of the angle. What is more, for the
armchair edge case, the MR is usually small. So, it is more favorable to
fabricate the graphene-based spin valve device by using the zigzag edge

Trojans under the gravitational influence of the four giant planets in compact

locations of Uranus and Neptune (aN) were varied to produce systems in which
those planets moved on non-resonant orbits, or in which they lay in their
mutual 1:2, 2:3 and 3:4 mean-motion resonances (MMRs). In total, 420
simulations were carried out, examining 42 different architectures, with a
total of 840000 particles across all runs. In the non-resonant cases, the
Trojans suffered only moderate levels of dynamical erosion, with the most
compact systems (those with aN less than or equal 18 AU) losing around 50% of
their Trojans by the end of the integrations. In the 2:3 and 3:4 MMR scenarios,
however, dynamical erosion was much higher with depletion rates typically
greater than 66% and total depletion in the most compact systems. The 1:2
resonant scenarios featured disruption on levels intermediate between the
non-resonant cases and other resonant scenarios, with depletion rates of the
order of tens of percent. Overall, the great majority of plausible
pre-migration planetary architectures resulted in severe levels of depletion of
the Neptunian Trojan clouds. In particular, if Uranus and Neptune formed near
their mutual 2:3 or 3:4 MMR and at heliocentric distances within 18 AU (as
favoured by recent studies), we found that the great majority of pre-formed
Trojans would have been lost prior to Neptune's migration. This strengthens the
case for the great bulk of the current Neptunian Trojan population having been
captured during that migration.

lowest cirrus regions with contiguous area on the sky. After removing bright
galaxies and subtracting zodiacal and Galactic foregrounds from the measured
sky brightness, we have successfully measured the CIB brightness and its
fluctuations across a wide range of angular scales from arcminutes to degrees.
The measured CIB brightness is consistent with previous results reported from
COBE data but significantly higher than the lower limits at 70 and 160 um
obtained with the Spitzer satellite from the stacking analysis of 24-um
selected sources. The discrepancy with the Spitzer result is possibly due to a
new galaxy population at high redshift obscured by hot dust. From power
spectrum analysis at 90 um, three components are identified: shot noise due to
individual galaxies; Galactic cirrus emission dominating at the largest angular
scales of a few degrees; and an additional component at an intermediate angular
scale of 10-30 arcminutes, possibly due to galaxy clustering. The spectral
shape of the clustering component at 90 um is very similar to that at longer
wavelengths as observed by Spitzer and BLAST. Moreover, the color of the
fluctuations indicates that the clustering component is as red as
Ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at high redshift, These galaxies are
not likely to be the majority of the CIB emission at 90 um, but responsible for

radiation therapy (IGRT). However, the large radiation dose from serial CBCT
scans in most IGRT procedures raises a clinical concern, especially for
pediatric patients who are essentially excluded from receiving IGRT for this
reason. The goal of this work is to develop a fast GPU-based algorithm to
reconstruct CBCT from undersampled and noisy projection data so as to lower the
imaging dose. Methods: The CBCT is reconstructed by minimizing an energy
functional consisting of a data fidelity term and a total variation
regularization term. We developed a GPU-friendly version of the
forward-backward splitting algorithm to solve this model. A multi-grid
technique is also employed. Results: It is found that 20~40 x-ray projections
are sufficient to reconstruct images with satisfactory quality for IGRT. The
reconstruction time ranges from 77 to 130 sec on a NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card,
depending on the number of projections used, which is estimated about 100 times
faster than similar iterative reconstruction approaches. Moreover, phantom
studies indicate that our algorithm enables the CBCT to be reconstructed under
a scanning protocol with as low as 0.1 mAs/projection. Comparing with currently
widely used full-fan head and neck scanning protocol of ~360 projections with
0.4 mAs/projection, it is estimated that an overall 36~72 times dose reduction
has been achieved in our fast CBCT reconstruction algorithm. Conclusions: This
work indicates that the developed GPU-based CBCT reconstruction algorithm is
capable of lowering imaging dose considerably. The high computation efficiency
in this algorithm makes the iterative CBCT reconstruction approach applicable
in real clinical environments.

vector into statistically independent variables. Deflation-based
implementations, such as the popular one-unit FastICA algorithm and its
variants, extract the independent components one after another. A novel method
for deflationary ICA, referred to as RobustICA, is put forward in this paper.
This simple technique consists of performing exact line search optimization of
the kurtosis contrast function. The step size leading to the global maximum of
the contrast along the search direction is found among the roots of a
fourth-degree polynomial. This polynomial rooting can be performed
algebraically, and thus at low cost, at each iteration. Among other practical
benefits, RobustICA can avoid prewhitening and deals with real- and
complex-valued mixtures of possibly noncircular sources alike. The absence of
prewhitening improves asymptotic performance. The algorithm is robust to local
extrema and shows a very high convergence speed in terms of the computational
cost required to reach a given source extraction quality, particularly for
short data records. These features are demonstrated by a comparative numerical
analysis on synthetic data. RobustICA's capabilities in processing real-world
data involving noncircular complex strongly super-Gaussian sources are
illustrated by the biomedical problem of atrial activity (AA) extraction in
atrial fibrillation (AF) electrocardiograms (ECGs), where it outperforms an
alternative ICA-based technique.

function showing a 30% decrease in the throughput in the short wavelength side
during the survey years, which potentially causes a systematic error in
photometry. The aging effect is consistent with variation of the instrumental
sensitivity in u-band, which is calibrated out. The expected colour variation
is consistent with measured colour variation in the catalog of repeated

length. We calculate the shift of the superfluid transition temperature due to
disorder and we highlight the role of quantum localization by comparing the
critical chemical potential with the classical percolation threshold. The
equation of state of the gas is determined in the regime of strong disorder,
where superfluidity is suppressed and the normal phase exists down to very low
temperatures. We find a $T^2$ dependence of the energy in agreement with the
expected behavior in the Bose glass phase. We also discuss the major role
played by the disorder correlation length and we make contact with a
Hartree-Fock mean-field approach that holds valid if the correlation length is
very large. The density profiles are analyzed as a function of temperature and
interaction strength. Effects of localization and the depletion of the order
parameter are emphasized in the comparison between local condensate and total
density. At very low temperature we find that the energy and the particle
distribution of the gas are very well described by the T=0 Gross-Pitaevskii

of the Kahler-Ricci flow is played by Donaldson's iteration on the space of all

extensively at X-ray, optical and infrared wavelengths throughout its outburst
in 2000. We show that it is possible to separate the optical/near-infrared
(OIR) jet emission from the OIR disc emission. Focussing on the jet component,
we find that as the source fades in the X-ray hard state, the OIR jet emission
has a spectral index consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission (alpha
~ -0.6 to -0.7, where F_nu \propto nu^alpha). This jet emission is tightly and
linearly correlated with the X-ray flux; L_OIR,jet \propto L_X^(0.98 +- 0.08)
suggesting a common origin. This is supported by the OIR, X-ray and OIR to
X-ray spectral indices being consistent with a single power law (alpha =
-0.73). Ostensibly the compact, synchrotron jet could therefore account for ~
100 % of the X-ray flux at low luminosities in the hard state. At the same
time, (i) an excess is seen over the power law decay of the X-ray flux at the
point in which the jet would start to dominate, (ii) the X-ray spectrum
slightly softens, which seems to be due to a high energy cut-off or break
shifting to a lower energy, and (iii) the X-ray rms variability increases. This
may be the strongest evidence to date of synchrotron emission from the compact,
steady jet dominating the X-ray flux of an X-ray binary. For XTE J1550-564,
this is likely to occur within the luminosity range ~ (2 e-4 - 2 e-3) L_Edd on
the hard state decline of this outburst. However, on the hard state rise of the
outburst and initially on the hard state decline, the synchrotron jet can only
provide a small fraction (~ a few per cent) of the X-ray flux. Both thermal
Comptonization and the synchrotron jet can therefore produce the hard X-ray
power law in accreting black holes.

  Philosophy of Science",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops an analogy proposed by Stachel between general relativity
(GR) and quantum mechanics (QM) as regards permutation invariance. Our main
idea is to overcome Pooley's criticism of the analogy by appeal to
paraparticles.
  In GR the equations are (the solution space is) invariant under
diffeomorphisms permuting spacetime points. Similarly, in QM the equations are
invariant under particle permutations. Stachel argued that this feature--a
theory's `not caring which point, or particle, is which'--supported a
structuralist ontology.
  Pooley criticizes this analogy: in QM the (anti-)symmetrization of fermions
and bosons implies that each individual state (solution) is fixed by each
permutation, while in GR a diffeomorphism yields in general a distinct, albeit
isomorphic, solution.
  We define various versions of structuralism, and go on to formulate Stachel's
and Pooley's positions, admittedly in our own terms. We then reply to Pooley.
Though he is right about fermions and bosons, QM equally allows more general
types of symmetry, in which states (vectors, rays or density operators) are not
fixed by all permutations (called `paraparticle states'). Thus Stachel's
analogy is revived.

X-ray and gamma ray study based on a recent XMM-Newton observation and archival
INTEGRAL and RXTE data. From the Fermi/LAT 1-year point source catalogue, we
tentatively associate XSSJ12270-4859 with 1FGLJ1227.9-4852, a source of high
energy gamma rays with emission up to 10GeV. We complement the study with UV
photometry from XMM-Newton and ground-based optical and near-IR photometry. The
X-ray emission is highly variable showing flares and intensity dips. The X-ray
flares consist of flare-dip pairs. Flares are also detected in the UV range but
not the dips. Aperiodic dipping behaviour is also observed during X-ray
quiescence but not in the UV. The 0.2-100keV spectrum is featureless and
described by a power law model with Gamma=1.7. The 100MeV-10GeV spectrum is
instead represented by a power law index of 2.45. The luminosity ratio between
0.1-100GeV and 0.2--100keV is ~0.8, hence the GeV emission is a significant
component of the total energy output. Furthermore, the X-ray spectrum does not
greatly change during flares, quiescence and the dips seen in quiescence but it
hardens during the post-flare dips. Optical photometry reveals a period of
4.32hr likely related to the binary orbit. Near-IR, possibly ellipsoidal,
variations are detected. Large amplitude variability on shorter (tens mins)
timescales are found to be non-periodic. The observed variability at all
wavelengths and the spectral characteristics strongly favour a low-mass
atypical low-luminosity X-ray binary and are against a Cataclysmic Variable
nature. The association with a Fermi/LAT high energy gamma ray source further
strengths this interpretation.

Sci., 63 (2010)",,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Considering the tangent plane at a point to a surface in the four-dimensional
Euclidean space, we find an invariant of a pair of two tangents in this plane.
If this invariant is zero, the two tangents are said to be conjugate. When the
two tangents coincide with a given tangent, then we obtain the normal curvature
of this tangent. Asymptotic tangents (curves) are characterized by zero normal
curvature. Considering the invariant of the pair of a given tangent and its
orthogonal one, we introduce the geodesic torsion of this tangent. We obtain
that principal tangents (curves) are characterized by zero geodesic torsion.
  The invariants $\varkappa$ and $k$ are introduced as the symmetric functions
of the two principal normal curvatures. The geometric meaning of the semi-sum
$\varkappa$ of the principal normal curvatures is equal (up to a sign) to the
curvature of the normal connection of the surface. The number of asymptotic
tangents at a point of the surface is determined by the sign of the invariant
$k$. In the case $k=0$ there exists a one-parameter family of asymptotic lines,
which are principal. We find examples of such surfaces ($k=0$) in the class of
the general rotational surfaces (in the sense of Moore). The principal
asymptotic lines on these surfaces are helices in the four-dimensional
Euclidean space.

finite support. The product in G gives rise to a coproduct on A making it a
multiplier Hopf algebra. In fact, because there exist integrals, we get an
algebraic quantum group.
  Now let H be a finite subgroup of G and consider the subalgebra of functions
in A that are constant on double cosets of H. The coproduct in general will not
leave this algebra invariant but we can modify it so that it will leave the
subalgebra invariant (in the sense that the image is in the multiplier algebra
of the tensor product of this subalgebra with itself). However, the modified
coproduct on the subalgebra will no longer be an algebra map. So, in general we
do not have an algebraic quantum group but a so-called algebraic quantum
hypergroup.
  Group-like projections in a *-algebraic quantum group A give rise, in a
natural way, to *-algebraic quantum hypergroups, very much like subgroups do as
above for a *-algebraic quantum group associated to a group. In this paper we
push this result further. On the one hand, we no longer assume the *-structure
while on the other hand, we allow the group-like projection to belong to the
multiplier algebra M(A) of A and not only to A itself. Doing so, we not only
get some well-known earlier examples of algebraic quantum hypergroups but also
some interesting new ones.

an effective atom-cavity coupling rate that is shown to be a key parameter in
the physics of the problem, allowing to generalize the known expression for the
Purcell factor to the case of broad emitters, and to define strategies to
optimize the performances of broad emitters-based single photon sources.
Moreover, pure dephasing is shown to be able to restore lasing in presence of
detuning, a further demonstration that decoherence can be seen as a fundamental
resource in solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics, offering appealing
perspectives in the context of advanced nano-photonic devices.

used for describing scattering states. In usual applications the KVP requires
the explicit form of the asymptotic behavior of the scattering wave function.
This is not the case when the integral relations are applied since, due to
their short range nature, the only condition for the scattering wave function
$\Psi$ is that it be the solution of $(H-E)\Psi=0$ in the internal region.
Several examples are analyzed for the computation of phase-shifts from bound
state type wave functions or, in the case of the scattering of charged
particles, it is possible to obtain phase-shifts using free asymptotic
conditions. As a final example we discuss the use of the integral relations in
the case of the Hyperspherical Adiabatic method.

speed V according to the Manhattan Random-Way Point model over a square region
of side length L. The resulting stationary (agent) spatial probability
distribution is far to be uniform: the average density over the ""central zone""
is asymptotically higher than that over the ""suburb"". Agents exchange data iff
they are at distance at most R within each other.
  We study the flooding time of this MANET: the number of time steps required
to broadcast a message from one source agent to all agents of the network in
the stationary phase. We prove the first asymptotical upper bound on the
flooding time. This bound holds with high probability, it is a decreasing
function of R and V, and it is tight for a wide and relevant range of the
network parameters (i.e. L, R and V).
  A consequence of our result is that flooding over the sparse and
highly-disconnected suburb can be as fast as flooding over the dense and
connected central zone. Rather surprisingly, this property holds even when R is
exponentially below the connectivity threshold of the MANET and the speed V is
very low.

spoiled due to contact interactions induced by vector multiplets may still be
mildly sequestered if a global version of the gauge symmetry associated to the
latter survives in the hidden sector. Interestingly, it has been argued that
although in such a situation non-trivial current-current contact interactions
are induced by the heavy vector modes, these do not induce soft scalar masses,
as a consequence of the global symmetry. We perform a detailed study of how
this hybrid mechanism can be implemented in supergravity and string models,
focusing on the prototypical case of heterotic M-theory orbifolds. We emphasize
that in general the mechanism works only up to subleading effects suppressed by
the ratio between the global symmetry breaking scale in the hidden sector and
the vector mass scale or the Planck scale. We also argue that this mild
sequestering mechanism allows to rehabilitate the scenario of dilaton
domination of supersymmetry breaking, which is incompatible with dilaton
stabilization in its original version, by exploiting the fact that hidden brane
fields do contribute to the cosmological constant but not to soft terms, thanks
to the global symmetry.
