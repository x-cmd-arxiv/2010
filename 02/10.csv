simulations to investigate the orbital decay and mass evolution of massive
black hole (MBH) pairs down to scales of ~30 pc during minor mergers of disk
galaxies. Our simulation set includes star formation and accretion onto the
MBHs, as well as feedback from both processes. We consider 1:10 merger events
starting at z~3, with MBH masses in the sensitivity window of the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna, and we follow the coupling between the merger
dynamics and the evolution of the MBH mass ratio until the satellite galaxy is
tidally disrupted. While the more massive MBH accretes in most cases as if the
galaxy were in isolation, the satellite MBH may undergo distinct episodes of
enhanced accretion, owing to strong tidal torques acting on its host galaxy and
to orbital circularization inside the disk of the primary galaxy. As a
consequence, the initial 1:10 mass ratio of the MBHs changes by the time the
satellite is disrupted. Depending on the initial fraction of cold gas in the
galactic disks and the geometry of the encounter, the mass ratios of the MBH
pairs at the time of satellite disruption can stay unchanged or become as large
as 1:2. Remarkably, the efficiency of MBH orbital decay correlates with the
final mass ratio of the pair itself: MBH pairs that increase significantly
their mass ratio are also expected to inspiral more promptly down to
nuclear-scale separations. These findings indicate that the mass ratios of MBH
pairs in galactic nuclei do not necessarily trace the mass ratios of their
merging host galaxies, but are determined by the complex interplay between gas
accretion and merger dynamics.

protoplanetary disks from observations of 1--10 Myr old stars with the
\textit{Spitzer Space Telescope}. New Spitzer results clearly show evidence for
two kinds of transitional disks and thus two main disk evolutionary pathways:
disks which form an inner hole/gap and clear from the inside out and disks that
deplete more homologously. Analyzing the disk populations of 1--10 Myr old
clusters such as Taurus, IC 348, NGC 2362, and $\eta$ Cha show that the mean
transitional disk lifetime must be an appreciable fraction of the mean
protoplanetary disk lifetime: $\approx$ 1 Myr out of 3--5 Myr. The varieties of
transitional disk SEDs and correlations with other disk diagnostics are
consistent with multiple mechanisms responsible for clearing disks.

Hekstra and Willems and extended by Kramer and Gastpar, and the analysis of the
resulting nonconvex optimization problem via a Lagrange dual formulation.
Finally, an observation is presented based on the properties of the conditional

the method that we derived earlier for positrons. For primaries, we estimate
the contributions from astrophysical sources (supernova remnants and pulsars)
by considering all known local objects within 2 kpc and a smooth distribution
beyond. We find that the electron flux in the energy range 5-30 GeV is well
reproduced by a smooth distant distribution of sources with index $\gamma\sim
2.3-2.4$, while local sources dominate the flux at higher energy. For
positrons, local pulsars have an important effect above 5-10 GeV. Uncertainties
affecting the source modeling and propagation are degenerate and each
translates into about one order of magnitude error in terms of local flux. The
spectral shape at high energy is weakly correlated with the spectral indices of
local sources, but more strongly with the hierarchy in their distance, age and
power. Despite the large theoretical errors that we describe, our global and
self-consistent analysis can explain all available data without over-tuning the
parameters, and therefore without the need to consider any exotic physics.
Though a \emph{standard paradigm} of Galactic CRs is well established, our
results show that we can hardly talk about any \emph{standard model} of CR
leptons, because of the very large theoretical uncertainties. Our analysis
provides details about the impact of these uncertainties, thereby sketching a

hydrodynamical description of the flow with a fully GR description of
Comptonization. We find that emission from a flow around a rapidly rotating
black hole is dominated by radiation produced within the innermost few
gravitational radii, the region where effects of the Kerr metric are strong.
The X-ray spectrum from such a flow depends on the inclination angle of the
line of sight to the symmetry axis, with higher angles characterised by a
harder slope and a higher cut-off energy.
  Under the (reasonable) assumption that the equatorial plane of a rotating
supermassive black hole is aligned with the surrounding torus, these predicted
properties may provide a crucial extension of the unified model of AGNs,
allowing to reconcile the model with systematic trends reported in a number of
studies of the X-ray spectral properties of AGNs (indicating that type 2
objects are harder than type 1 and that the relative amount of the reflected
radiation is larger in the latter). On the other hand, the model with a rapidly
rotating black hole predicts larger apparent luminosities for objects observed
at higher viewing angles, while an opposite property (i.e. type 1 objects being
more luminous than type 2) was revealed in the Integral data.

An important sub-class of this are problems of the following form: Alice and

than what its own output reveals. To aid in this, they have available a set up
- correlated random variables whose distribution is different from the desired

present an upperbound on how efficiently a given set up can be used to produce
samples from a desired distribution.
  The key tool we develop is a generalization of the concept of common
information of two dependent random variables [Gacs-Korner, 1973]. Our
generalization - a three-dimensional region - remedies some of the limitations
of the original definition which captured only a limited form of dependence. It
also includes as a special case Wyner's common information [Wyner, 1975]. To
derive the cryptographic bounds, we rely on a monotonicity property of this
region: the region of the ""views"" of Alice and Bob engaged in any protocol can
only monotonically expand and not shrink. Thus, by comparing the regions for
the target random variables and the given random variables, we obtain our
upperbound.

distribution for a black hole transforms to a (microcanonical) distribution
which depends on nonadditive integrals of the motion and represents a nonlinear
function of energy - the square of black hole mass. From a comparison with the
standard microcanonical distribution it is found that the statistical weight of
black hole should be proportional to the black hole area. A definition of the
black hole entropy consistent with the statistical weight is proposed.

$\{hxh^{-1} \mid h \in H, x \in X\}$, and when $X$ is a free-generating set of

  For a group $F$ and an element $r$ of $F$, we say that $r$ is Cohen-Lyndon
aspherical in $F$ if ${}^F\{r\}$ is a Whitehead subset of the subgroup of $F$
that is generated by ${}^F\{r\}$.
  In 1963, D. E. Cohen and R. C. Lyndon independently showed that in each free
group each non-trivial element is Cohen-Lyndon aspherical.
  In 1987, M. Edjvet and J. Howie showed that if $A$ and $B$ are locally
indicable groups, then each cyclically reduced element of $A \ast B$ that does
not lie in $A \cup B$ is Cohen-Lyndon aspherical in $A \ast B$.
  Using Bass-Serre Theory and the Edjvet-Howie Theorem, one can deduce the
local-indicability Cohen-Lyndon Theorem: if $F$ is a locally indicable group
and $T$ is an $F$-tree with trivial edge stabilizers, then each element of $F$
that fixes no vertex of $T$ is Cohen-Lyndon aspherical in $F$. Conversely, the
Cohen-Lyndon Theorem and the Edjvet-Howie Theorem are immediate consequences of
the local-indicability Cohen-Lyndon Theorem.
  In this article, we give a detailed review of Howie induction and arrange the
arguments of Edjvet and Howie into a Howie-inductive proof of the
local-indicability Cohen-Lyndon Theorem that does not use Magnus induction or
the Cohen-Lyndon Theorem. We conclude with a review of some standard
applications of Cohen-Lyndon asphericity.

A viscous dark fluid is included, and we include also modified gravity using
its fluid representation. It is demonstrated how such an expression reduces to
the standard Cardy-Verlinde formula corresponding to the 2d CFT entropy only in
some special cases. The dynamical entropy bound for a closed FRW universe with
dark components is obtained. The universality of the dynamical entropy bound
near a future singularity (of all four types), as well as near the Big Bang
singularity, is investigated. It is demonstrated that except from some special
cases of Type II and Type IV singularities the dynamical entropy bound is
violated near the singularity even if quantum effects are taken into account.
The dynamical entropy bound seems to be universal for the case of a regular

This iterative method estimates the astronomical signal by carrying out a

RFI. In addition it is fast, robust, does not need a data model before it can
be executed and works in almost all configurations with its default parameters.
The method has been compared using simulated data with several other mitigation
techniques, including one based upon the singular value decomposition of the
time-frequency matrix, and has shown better results than the rest.

fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Several examples exist in the Milky
Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst
and interacting galaxies. The few young massive clusters that are close enough
to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the
ecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The
distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster
mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation
mechanisms of young cluster populations. Young massive clusters are expected to
be the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exotic
stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in young
massive clusters, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are
unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review we focus on star clusters
younger than $\sim100$ Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and
more massive than $\sim10^4$ \Msun, irrespective of cluster size or
environment. We describe the global properties of the currently known young
massive star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of

make this review readable by observers, theorists, and computational

heavily polluted stars being those of the metal-rich component. We propose a

18 deg, in the inner dark matter halo regions where the disks reside, between
the spin vector of the gaseous and stellar galactic disks and that of their
inner host haloes. The alignment between galaxy spin and spin of the entire

preferentially aligned so as to point along their host filaments. (iii) The
spin of disks in lower-mass haloes shows, at redshifts above z~0.5 and in
regions of low environmental density, a clear signature of alignment with the
intermediate principal axis of the large-scale tidal field. This behavior is
consistent with predictions of linear tidal torque theory. This alignment
decreases with increasing environmental density, and vanishes in the highest
density regions. Non-linear effects in the high density environments are
plausibly responsible for establishing this density-alignment correlation. We
expect that our numerical results provide important insights for both
understanding intrinsic alignment in weak lensing from the astrophysical

supersymmetry breaking originates from a single source. In this paper, we relax
this underlying assumption and consider a multiplicity of sectors which
independently break supersymmetry, thus yielding a corresponding multiplicity
of goldstini. While one linear combination of goldstini is eaten via the
super-Higgs mechanism, the orthogonal combinations remain in the spectrum as
physical degrees of freedom. Interestingly, supergravity effects induce a
universal tree-level mass for the goldstini which is exactly twice the
gravitino mass. Since visible sector fields can couple dominantly to the
goldstini rather than the gravitino, this framework allows for substantial
departures from conventional supersymmetric phenomenology. In fact, this even
occurs when a conventional mediation scheme is augmented by additional
supersymmetry breaking sectors which are fully sequestered. We discuss a number

eliminated, but the bulk of the $m_{a_1}>7.5\gev$ scenarios, which are

only NMSSM ideal Higgs scenarios with $m_{h_1}\gsim 98\gev$ and $m_{a_1}$ close

as occurs, for example, in avalanches. The evolution of a bidisperse mixture of

equation, provided the shear (or velocity) is a known function of position.
While avalanche-driven shear is approximately uniform in depth, boundary-driven
shear typically creates a shear band with a nonlinear velocity profile. In this
paper, we measure a velocity profile from experimental data and solve initial
value problems that mimic the segregation observed in the experiment, thereby
verifying the value of the continuum model. To simplify the analysis, we
consider only one-dimensional configurations, in which a layer of small
particles is placed above a layer of large particles within an annular shear
cell and is sheared for arbitrarily long times. We fit the measured velocity
profile to both an exponential function of depth and a piecewise linear
function which separates the shear band from the rest of the material. Each
solution of the initial value problem is non-standard, involving curved
characteristics in the exponential case, and a material interface with a jump

the lowest band edge frequency, into the semi-infinite spectral gap. Our
results extend to bifurcations into finite spectral gaps, for focusing or
defocusing (repulsive) nonlinearities under more restrictive hypotheses.
Soliton nonlinear bound states with frequencies near a band edge are
well-approximated by a slowly decaying solution of a homogenized NLS/GP
equation, with constant homogenized effective mass tensor and effective
nonlinear coupling coefficient, modulated by a Bloch state. For the critical
NLS equation with a periodic potential, e.g. the cubic two dimensional NLS/GP
with a periodic potential, our results imply that the limiting soliton power,
as the spectral band edge frequency is approached, is equal to a constant
\zeta_* times the minimal mass soliton of the translation invariant critical
NLS equation. \zeta_* is expressible in terms of the band edge Bloch
eigenfunction and the determinant of the effective mass tensor; and
0<\zeta_*<1$ for any non-constant potential. The results are confirmed by
numerical computation of bound states with frequencies near the spectral band

A recent theoretical advance in the study of these systems is the derivation of
a number of exact universal relations that are predicted to be valid for all
interaction strengths, temperatures, and spin compositions. These equations,
referred to as the Tan relations, relate a microscopic quantity, namely, the
amplitude of the high-momentum tail of the fermion momentum distribution, to
the thermodynamics of the many-body system. In this work, we provide
experimental verification of the Tan relations in a strongly interacting gas of

determine the effect of interactions on these microscopic probes. We then

to additive homoscedastic uniform noise around the subspaces (i.e., uniform

equations (BIEs) on rotationally symmetric surfaces in three dimensions is
presented. The scheme uses the Fourier transform to reduce the original BIE
defined on a surface to a sequence of BIEs defined on a generating curve for
the surface. It can handle loads that are not necessarily rotationally
symmetric. Nystrom discretization is used to discretize the BIEs on the
generating curve. The quadrature used is a high-order Gaussian rule that is
modified near the diagonal to retain high-order accuracy for singular kernels.
The reduction in dimensionality, along with the use of high-order accurate
quadratures, leads to small linear systems that can be inverted directly via,
e.g., Gaussian elimination. This makes the scheme particularly fast in
environments involving multiple right hand sides. It is demonstrated that for
BIEs associated with Laplace's equation, the kernel in the reduced equations
can be evaluated very rapidly by exploiting recursion relations for Legendre
functions. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the scheme; in
particular, it is demonstrated that for a BIE associated with Laplace's
equation on a surface discretized using 320 000 points, the set-up phase of the
algorithm takes 2 minutes on a standard desktop, and then solves can be
executed in 0.5 seconds.

radial velocity curves for this system. The GU Boo light curves presented in
LR05 had substantial asymmetries, which were attributed to large spots. In
spite of the asymmetry LR05 derived masses and radii accurate to about 2%. We
obtained additional photometry of GU Boo using both a CCD and a single-channel
photometer and modeled the light curves with the ELC software to determine if
the large spots in the light curves give rise to systematic errors at the few
percent level. We also modeled the original light curves from LR05 using models
with and without spots. We derived a radius of the primary of 0.6329 +- 0.0026
Solar-Radii, 0.6413 +- 0.0049 SR, and 0.6373 +- 0.0029 SR from the CCD,
photoelectric, and LR05 data, respectively. Each of these measurements agrees
with the value reported by LR05 (R1=0.623 +- 0.016 SR) at the level of about
2%. In addition, the spread in these values is about 1-2% from the mean. For
the secondary, we derive radii of 0.6074 +- 0.0035 SR, 0.5944 +- 0.0069 SR, and
0.5976 +- 0.0059 SR from the three respective data sets. The LR05 value is
R2=0.620 +- 0.020 SR, which is about 2-3% larger than each of the three values
we found. The spread in these values is about 2% from the mean. The systematic
difference between our three determinations of the secondary radius and that of
LR05 might be attributed to differences in the modelling process and codes
used. Our own fits suggest that, for GU Boo at least, using accurate spot
modelling of a single set of multicolor light curves results in radii
determinations accurate at the 2% level.

in fluxes and dimensions to longer MIR wavelengths. This is likely to arise as
a result of emission by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within extended
photodissociation regimes, centred upon more compact ionized regions
responsible for much of the shorter wave emission. Such dual emission
structures are characteristic of those observed in many compact HII regions.
Finally, we note that the clouds have asymmetrical structures and wind-swept

complex systems always contain error links, and most of the community detection
algorithms have random factors, evaluate the significance of community
structure is important and urgent. In this paper, we use the eigenvectors'
stability to characterize the significance of community structures. By
employing the eigenvalues of Laplacian matrix of a given network, we can
evaluate the significance of its community structure and obtain the optimal
number of communities, which are always hard for community detection
algorithms. We apply our method to many real networks. We find that significant
community structures exist in many social networks and C.elegans neural

protein-interaction networks and metabolic networks. Our method can be applied
to broad clustering problems in data mining due to its solid mathematical basis

theory of analysis on post-critically finite self-similar fractals. This is
achieved by showing that the purely imaginary Riesz and Bessel potentials on
nested fractals with 3 or more boundary points are of this type. It follows
that these operators are bounded on $L^{p}$, $1<p<\infty$ and satisfy weak 1-1
bounds. The analysis may be extended to infinite blow-ups of these fractals,
and to product spaces based on the fractal or its blow-up.

popular approach to find exact or approximate solutions to optimization and

field with related techniques, such as grammatical evolution, being developed.
Unfortunately, work on developing genetic optimizations for low-end embedded
architectures hasn't embraced the same enthusiasm. This short paper tackles
that situation by demonstrating how genetic algorithms can be implemented in
Arduino Duemilanove, a 16 MHz open-source micro-controller, with limited

optical spectra of six representative types of galaxies (star-forming and
composite galaxies, Seyfert 2s, LINERs, E+A and early-type galaxies), which are
taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Throughout our paper, we use
the simple stellar populations (SSPs) from each EPS model and the software
STARLIGHT to do our fits. Our main results are: Using different EPS models the
resulted numerical values of contributed light fractions change obviously, even
though the dominant populations are consistent. The stellar population
synthesis does depend on the selection of age and metallicity, while it does
not depend on the stellar evolution track much. The importance of young
populations decreases from star-forming, composite, Seyfert 2, LINER to
early-type galaxies, and E+A galaxies lie between composite galaxies and
Seyfert 2s in most cases. We conclude that different EPS models do derive
different stellar populations, so that it is not reasonable to directly compare
stellar populations estimated from different EPS models. To get reliable
results, we should use the same EPS model for the compared samples.

Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is proposed to estimate a factor multivariate

density. The marginal likelihood approach of Chib (1995) is used to choose the
number of factors, with the posterior density ordinates approximated by
Gaussian copula. Simulation and real data applications suggest that the
proposed simulation method is computationally much more efficient than the
approach of Chib. Nardari and Shephard (2006}. This increase in computational
efficiency is particularly important in calculating marginal likelihoods
because it is necessary to carry out the simulation a number of times to
estimate the posterior ordinates for a given marginal likelihood. In addition
to the MCMC method, the paper also proposes a fast approximate EM method to
estimate the factor multivariate stochastic volatility model. The estimates
from the approximate EM method are of interest in their own right, but are
especially useful as initial inputs to MCMC methods, making them more efficient

present early science results for Taurus. CO J=3-2 maps have been secured along
the north-west ridge and bowl, collectively known as L 1495, along with deep
13CO and C18O J=3-2 maps in two sub-regions. With these data we search for
molecular outflows, and use the distribution of flows, HH objects and shocked
H2 line emission features, together with the population of young stars,
protostellar cores and starless condensations to map star formation across this
extensive region. In total 21 outflows are identified. It is clear that the
bowl is more evolved than the ridge, harbouring a greater population of T Tauri
stars and a more diffuse, more turbulent ambient medium. By comparison, the
ridge contains a much younger, less widely distributed population of protostars
which, in turn, is associated with a greater number of molecular outflows. We
estimate the ratio of the numbers of prestellar to protostellar cores in L 1495
to be ~ 1.3-2.3, and of gravitationally unbound starless cores to
(gravitationally bound) prestellar cores to be ~ 1. If we take previous
estimates of the protostellar lifetime of ~ 5 x 10^5 yrs, this indicates a
prestellar lifetime of 9(+/-3) x 10^5 yrs. From the number of outflows we also
crudely estimate the star formation efficiency in L 1495, finding it to be
compatible with a canonical value of 10-15 %. We note that molecular
outflow-driving sources have redder near-IR colours than their HH jet-driving
counterparts. We also find that the smaller, denser cores are associated with
the more massive outflows, as one might expect if mass build-up in the flow
increases with the collapse and contraction of the protostellar envelope.

under some debate, with a variety of different source reservoirs being proposed
in the last decade. In this work, we suggest that the Neptune Trojans (together
with the Jovian Trojans) could represent an additional significant source of
Centaurs. Using dynamical simulations of the first Neptune Trojan discovered
(2001 QR322), together with integrations following the evolution of clouds of
theoretical Neptune Trojans obtained during simulations of planetary migration,
we show that the Neptune Trojan population contains a great number of objects
which are unstable on both Myr and Gyr timescales. Using individual examples,
we show how objects that leave the Neptunian Trojan cloud evolve onto orbits
indistinguishable from those of the known Centaurs, before providing a range of
estimates of the flux from this region to the Centaur population. With only
moderate assumptions, it is shown that the Trojans can contribute a significant
proportion of the Centaur population, and may even be the dominant source
reservoir. This result is supported by past work on the colours of the Trojans
and the Centaurs, but it will take future observations to determine the full
scale of the contribution of the escaped Trojans to the Centaur population.

Increasing the interactions above another critical value $g_{max}$ makes this
process unstable. Instead of soliton formation one now meets the phenomenon of
incoherent self-trapping. In this regime a fraction of atoms is trapped in
incoherent localized wave-packets, while the remaining atoms spread

dilution were based on controlled desalting kinetics according to methods

decreasing IS, the electrostatically screened polymers and nanoparticles system
undergo an abrupt transition between an unassociated and a clustered state. By

alphabet $\{1,..., \ell\}$. We define the projection entropy function $h_\pi$
on the space of invariant measures on $\Sigma$ associated with the coding map
$\pi: \Sigma\to K$, and develop some basic ergodic properties about it. This
concept turns out to be crucial in the study of dimensional properties of
invariant measures on $K$. We show that for any conformal IFS (resp., the
direct product of finitely many conformal IFS), without any separation
condition, the projection of an ergodic measure under $\pi$ is always exactly
dimensional and, its Hausdorff dimension can be represented as the ratio of its
projection entropy to its Lyapunov exponent (resp., the linear combination of
projection entropies associated with several coding maps). Furthermore, for any
conformal IFS and certain affine IFS, we prove a variational principle between
the Hausdorff dimension of the attractors and that of projections of ergodic
measures.

linear perturbations. We compare our results with the corresponding results for
minimally coupled quintessence perturbations. Our results for natural (O(1))
values of parameters in the Lagrangian which lead to a background expansion
similar to LCDM are summarized as follows: 1. Scalar-Tensor dark energy density
perturbations are amplified by a factor of about 10^6 compared to minimally
coupled quintessence perturbations on scales less than about 100 h^{-1} Mpc. On
these scales dark energy perturbations constitute a fraction of about 10%
compared to matter density perturbations. 2. Scalar-Tensor dark energy density
perturbations are anti-correlated with matter linear perturbations on
sub-Hubble scales. Thus clusters of galaxies are predicted to overlap with
voids of dark energy. 3. This anti-correlation of matter with negative pressure
perturbations induces a mild amplification of matter perturbations by about 10%
on sub-Hubble scales. 4. The evolution of scalar field perturbations on
sub-Hubble scales, is scale independent and therefore it corresponds to a
vanishing effective speed of sound (c_{s\Phi}=0). It also involves large
oscillations at early times induced by the amplified effective mass of the
field. This amplification is due to the non-minimal coupling of the field to
the Ricci curvature scalar and (thus) to matter. No such oscillations are
present in minimally coupled quintessence perturbations which are suppressed on
sub-Hubble scales (c_{s\Phi}=1). Implications of our results include modified
predictions for cluster halo profiles observed properties. These profiles are
known to be in some tension with the predictions of LCDM.

a stable estimation with the neighborhood region size increasing. Experiments

reconciled within a single theoretical framework by assuming a radial-dependent
effective mass, peaked at the nuclear surface. The aim of this exploratory work

demonstrate that the $\tau \frac{d\rho}{dr}$ term quenches the 1f5/2-1f7/2

of observables and pure states be mutually separating] is proposed as a
universal mechanics potentially covering all physical phenomena. It facilitates
development of an autonomous formalism for quantum mechanics. Quantum systems,
defined algebraically as supmech Hamiltonian systems with non-supercommutative
system algebras, are shown to inevitably have Hilbert space based realizations
(so as to accommodate rigged Hilbert space based Dirac bra-ket formalism),
generally admitting commutative superselection rules. Traditional features of
quantum mechanics of finite particle systems appear naturally. A treatment of
localizability much simpler and more general than the traditional one is given.
Treating massive particles as localizable elementary quantum systems, the
Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger wave functions with traditional Born interpretation appear
as natural objects for the description of their pure states and the
Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equation for them is obtained without ever using a
classical Hamiltonian or Lagrangian. A provisional set of axioms for the
supmech program is given.

estimated black hole mass of ~10^5 Msun. Rapid and strong X-ray variability
with an rms amplitude of ~60 per cent is observed in the 0.4-10 keV band with
the XIS cameras. The shape of the light curve appears to depend on energies.
The hard X-ray emission is detected up to 35 keV with the HXD-PIN detector at a
similar flux level as observed with the INTEGRAL IBIS. The X-ray spectrum below
10 keV is strongly absorbed by partially ionized (xi~35) gas with a mean
equivalent hydrogen column density of ~2e22 cm^-2, when a simple absorption
model is applied. The spectral shape is also strongly variable but not a simple
function of the source brightness. The spectral variability appears to be
accounted for mainly by continuum slope changes, but variability in the ionized
absorber may also play some part. The apparently flat spectral slope with
photon index of 1.4 below 10 keV, obtained after correcting for absorption, is
marginally inconsistent with the photon index of 2 inferred from the 14-35 keV
PIN spectrum. If the true spectral slope was as steep as that measured in the
hard X-ray band, there would be an extra absorption component, which we are
unable to detect. Combined with the INTEGRAL measurements, the hard X-ray
emission above 10 keV exceeds the optical emission in terms of luminosity and
dominates the broadband energy output, unless a large excess of UV disk
emission is yet to be detected in the unobservable band. A weak Fe K line is
seen at 6.4 keV with the average equivalent width of 110 eV, which does not
show clear flux changes over the 3-day observation.

2009. The main aim of these monitoring observations is to study spectral
variabilities in the Be disc, on both the short (a week or so) and long (more
than hundreds of days) timescales, by taking long-term frequent observations.
Our four-year spectroscopic observations indicate that the V/R ratio, i.e., the
relative intensity of the violet (V) peak to the red (R) one, of the
double-peaked H-alpha line profile varies with a period of 500 days. The H-beta
line profile also varies in phase with the H-alpha profile. With these
observations covering two full cycles of the V/R variability, we reconstruct
the 2-D structure of the Be disc by applying the Doppler tomography method to
the H-alpha and H-beta emission line profiles, using a rigidly rotating frame
with the V/R variability period. The resulting disc structure reveals
non-axisymmetric features, which can be explained by a one-armed perturbation
in the Be disc. It is the first time that an eccentric disc structure is
directly detected by using a method other than the interferometric one.

from VIMOS and FORS public observations. Using the full multi-wavelength
14-bands photometry, we determined the physical properties of the galaxies,
through a standard spectral energy distribution fitting with the updated
Charlot & Bruzual (2009) templates. We also added other relevant observations,
i.e. the 24mu m observations from Spitzer/MIPS and the 2 MSec Chandra X-ray
observations. Finally, using non parametric diagnostics (Gini, Concentration,
Asymmetry, M_20 and ellipticity), we characterized the rest-frame UV morphology
of the galaxies. We then analyzed how these physical and morphological
properties correlate with the presence of the Lyalpha line in the optical
spectra. We find that, unlike at higher redshift, the dependence of physical
properties on the Lyalpha line is milder: galaxies without Lyalpha in emission
tend to be more massive and dustier than the rest of the sample, but all other
parameters, ages, SFRs, X-ray emission as well as UV morphology do not depend
strongly on the presence of the line emission. A simple scenario where all LBGs
have intrinsically high Lyalpha emission, but where dust and neutral hydrogen
content (which shape the final appearance of the Lyalpha) depend on the mass of
the galaxies, is able to reproduce the majority of the observed properties at
z~3. Some modification might be needed to account for the observed evolution of
these properties with cosmic epoch, which is also discussed.

that it is a universal method for summarising uncertainty and making estimates

an assumed model (Gelman 2008). The Bayesian perspective is thus applicable to
all aspects of statistical inference, while being open to the incorporation of
information items resulting from earlier experiments and from expert opinions.
We provide here the basic elements of Bayesian analysis when considered for
standard models, refering to Marin and Robert (2007) and to Robert (2007) for
book-length entries.1 In the following, we refrain from embarking upon
philosophical discussions about the nature of knowledge (see, e.g., Robert
2007, Chapter 10), opting instead for a mathematically sound presentation of an
eminently practical statistical methodology. We indeed believe that the most
convincing arguments for adopting a Bayesian version of data analyses are in
the versatility of this tool and in the large range of existing applications,
rather than in those polemical arguments.

with boundary conditions are solved simultaneously. For the change of chemical
composition, which determines the evolution of a star, a diffusion treatment
for convection and semiconvection is used. A set of 30 nuclear reactions are
solved simultaneously with the stellar structure and evolution equations.
Several results on the main sequence, and during the hydrogen and helium
burning phases, are described. Low metallicity massive stars are hotter and
more compact and luminous than their metal enriched counterparts. Due to their
high temperatures, pregalactic stars activate sooner the triple alpha reaction
self-producing their own heavy elements. Both galactic and pregalactic stars
are radiation pressure dominated and evolve below the Eddington luminosity
limit with short lifetimes. The physical characteristics of the first stars
have an important influence in predictions of the ionizing photon yields from
the first luminous objects; also they develop large convective cores with
important helium core masses which are important for explosion calculations.

shock is studied. We find large discrepancies between the lifetime of the cloud

to be due to the assumption in Hartquist et al. that mass-loss occurs largely
as a result of lower pressure regions on the surface of the cloud away from the
stagnation point, whereas in reality Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities play a
dominant role in the cloud destruction. We find that the true lifetime of the
cloud (defined as when all of the material from the core of the cloud is well
mixed with the intercloud material in the hydrodynamic cells) is about 6 times
t_KHD, where t_KHD is the growth timescale for the most disruptive,
long-wavelength, KH instabilities. These findings have wide implications for
diffuse sources where there is transfer of material between hot and cool
phases.

density contrast are also studied. The interaction is milder at lower Mach
numbers with the most marked differences occuring at low shock Mach numbers

surface air temperature data. Our novel method uncovers peculiar wave-like
structures of high energy flow, that we relate to global surface ocean
currents. This points to a major role of the oceanic surface circulation in
coupling and stabilizing the global temperature field in the long term mean
(140 years for the model run and 60 years for reanalysis data). We find that
these results cannot be obtained using classical linear methods of multivariate
data analysis, and have ensured their robustness by intensive significance
testing.

continuous site percolation situation. By this we mean that we delete a random
set $\Gamma_\omega$ from $IR^d$ and consider the Dirichlet or Neumann Laplacian
on $D=IR^d\setminus\Gamma_\omega$. We prove that the integrated density of
states exhibits Lifshitz behavior at the bottom of the spectrum when we
consider Dirichlet boundary conditions, while when we consider Neumann boundary
conditions, it is bounded from below by a van Hove behavior. The Lifshitz tails
are proven independently of the percolation probability, whereas for the van
Hove case we need some assumption on the volume of the sets taken out as well
as on the percolation probability.

than unity and covers only part of the QSO broad emission line region. The zero
flux level has to be corrected at the position of the saturated H_2 and
optically thin HD lines by about 10%. We accurately determine the Doppler
parameter for HD and CI lines (b = 1.86+/-0.20 km/s). We find a ratio
N(HD)/N(H_2)=(7.1 +3.7 -2.2)x10^-5 that is significantly higher than what is
observed in molecular clouds of the Galaxy. Chemical models suggest that in the
physical conditions prevailing in the central part of molecular clouds,
deuterium and hydrogen are mostly in their molecular forms. Assuming this is
true, we derive D/H = (3.6 +1.9 -1.1)x10^-5. This implies that the
corresponding baryon density of the Universe is \Omega_b h^2 = (0.0182 +0.0047
-0.0042). This value coincides within 1\sigma with that derived from
observations of the CMBR as well as from observations of the D/H atomic ratio
in low-metallicity QSO absorption line systems. The observation of HD at high
redshift is therefore a promising independent method to constrain \Omega_b.
This observation indicates as well a low astration factor of deuterium. This
can be interpreted as the consequence of an intense infall of primordial gas
onto the associated galaxy.

first studied by simulating the conditions in the different known components of
Orion-KL: chemical models for a hot core, a plateau and a ridge were coupled
with an accelerated Lambda$-iteration (ALI) radiative transfer model to predict
H2O line fluxes and profiles. Our models include the first 45 energy levels of
ortho- and para-H2O. We find that lines arising from energy levels below 560 K
were best reproduced by a gas of density 3x10^5 cm^-3 at a temperature of 70-90
K, expanding at a velocity of 30 km s^-1 and with a H2O/H2 abundance ratio of
the order of 2 - 3 x 10^-5, similar to the abundance derived by Cernicharo et
al. (2006). However, the model that best reproduces the fluxes and profiles of
H2O lines arising from energy levels above 560 K has a significantly higher
H2O/H2 abundance, 1 - 5 x 10^-4, originating from gas of similar density, in
the Plateau region, that has been heated to 300 K, relaxing to 90-100 K. We
conclude that the observed water lines do not originate from high temperature

spin chain cuprates. Despite this unexpected result, the thus predominantly
phononic heat conductivity of these spin-Peierls compounds exhibits a very
unusual behavior. In particular, we observe strong anomalies at the phase
transitions Tc1 and Tc2. Moreover, we find an overall but anisotropic
suppression of \kappa in the intermediate phase which extends even to
temperatures higher than Tc2. An external magnetic field causes a slight
downshift of the transition at Tc1 and enhances the suppression of \kappa up to
Tc2. We interprete our findings in terms of strong spin-phonon coupling and
phonon scattering arising from spin-driven lattice distortions.
