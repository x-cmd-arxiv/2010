an open string tachyon, and study the instability from the viewpoint of the
boundary field theory. We focus on the specific example of the AdS_5 X S^5
background with two probe D7 branes intersecting at general angles. For generic
angles supersymmetry is completely broken and there is an open string tachyon
between the branes. The field theory action for this system is obtained by
coupling to N =4 super Yang-Mills two N =2 hyper multiplets in the fundamental
representation of the SU(N) gauge group, but with different choices of
embedding of the two N=2 subalgebras into N=4. On the field theory side we find
a one-loop Coleman-Weinberg instability in the effective potential for the
fundamental scalars. We identify a mesonic operator as the dual of the open
string tachyon. By AdS/CFT, we predict the tachyon mass for small 't Hooft
coupling (large bulk curvature) and confirm that it violates the AdS stability

our most precise atomic clocks. Key to a high sensitivity is the possibility to
achieve long measurement times and precise readout. Ultra cold atoms can be
precisely manipulated at the quantum level, held for very long times in traps,
and would therefore be an ideal setting for interferometry. In this paper we
discuss how the non-linearities from atom-atom interactions on one hand allow
to efficiently produce squeezed states for enhanced readout, but on the other
hand result in phase diffusion which limits the phase accumulation time. We
find that low dimensional geometries are favorable, with two-dimensional (2D)
settings giving the smallest contribution of phase diffusion caused by
atom-atom interactions. Even for time sequences generated by optimal control
the achievable minimal detectable interaction energy $\Delta E^{\rm min}$ is on
the order of 0.001 times the chemical potential of the BEC in the trap. From
there we have to conclude that for more precise measurements with atom
interferometers more sophisticated strategies, or turning off the interaction
induced dephasing during the phase accumulation stage, will be necessary.

with $n$ variables over $\mathbb{F}_2$ in which each equation is assigned a
positive weight and we wish to find an assignment of values to the variables
that maximizes the excess, which is the total weight of satisfied equations
minus the total weight of falsified equations. Using an algebraic approach, we
obtain a lower bound for the maximum excess.
  Max Lin Above Average (Max Lin AA) is a parameterized version of Max Lin
introduced by Mahajan et al. (Proc. IWPEC'06 and J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 75,
2009). In Max Lin AA all weights are integral and we are to decide whether the
maximum excess is at least $k$, where $k$ is the parameter.
  It is not hard to see that we may assume that no two equations in $Az=b$ have
the same left-hand side and $n={\rm rank A}$. Using our maximum excess results,
we prove that, under these assumptions, Max Lin AA is fixed-parameter tractable
for a wide special case: $m\le 2^{p(n)}$ for an arbitrary fixed function
$p(n)=o(n)$.
  Max $r$-Lin AA is a special case of Max Lin AA, where each equation has at
most $r$ variables. In Max Exact $r$-SAT AA we are given a multiset of $m$
clauses on $n$ variables such that each clause has $r$ variables and asked
whether there is a truth assignment to the $n$ variables that satisfies at
least $(1-2^{-r})m + k2^{-r}$ clauses. Using our maximum excess results, we
prove that for each fixed $r\ge 2$, Max $r$-Lin AA and Max Exact $r$-SAT AA can
be solved in time $2^{O(k \log k)}+m^{O(1)}.$ This improves
$2^{O(k^2)}+m^{O(1)}$-time algorithms for the two problems obtained by Gutin et

further allows an user to specify policies regarding which services or machines

standard framework for Granger causality is that it only allows for examination
of interactions between single (univariate) variables within a system, perhaps
conditioned on other variables. However, interactions do not necessarily take
place between single variables, but may occur among groups, or ""ensembles"", of

causality in the context of causal interactions among two or more multivariate

justifications for one particular form of multivariate Granger causality based
on the generalized variances of residual errors. Taken together, our results
support a comprehensive and theoretically consistent extension of Granger
causality to the multivariate case. Treated individually, they highlight
several specific advantages of the generalized variance measure, which we
illustrate using applications in neuroscience as an example. We further show
how the measure can be used to define ""partial"" Granger causality in the

three gauge-invariant contributions, one of which has no counterpart at zero
field. The extra contribution is collinear with and explicitly dependent on the
electric field. The expression for the orbital magnetization is suitable for
first-principles implementations, allowing to calculate the magnetoelectric
response coefficients by numerical differentiation. Alternatively,
perturbation-theory techniques may be used, and for that purpose we derive an
expression directly for the linear magnetoelectric tensor by taking the first
field-derivative analytically. Two types of terms are obtained. One, the
`Chern-Simons' term, depends only on the unperturbed occupied orbitals and is
purely isotropic. The other, `Kubo' term, involves the first-order change in
the orbitals and gives isotropic as well as anisotropic contributions to the
response. In ordinary magnetoelectric insulators both terms are generally
present, while in strong Z2 topological insulators only the former type is
allowed, and is quantized. In order to validate the theory we have calculated
under periodic boundary conditions the linear magnetoelectric coupling for a

We estimate the progenitor's mass-loss rate at (4 ~ 10) * 10^-5 Msol/yr (for
v_w = 10 km/s). Two bright spots are seen in the images. The first, in the
northeast, is now fading. The second, very near the center of the projected
shell and unique to SN1986J, is still brightening relative to the shell, and
now dominates the VLBI images. It is marginally resolved at 22 GHz (diameter
~0.3 mas; ~5 * 10^16 cm at 10 Mpc). The integrated VLA spectrum of SN1986J
shows an inversion point and a high-frequency turnover, both progressing
downward in frequency and due to the central bright spot. The optically-thin
spectral index of the central bright spot is indistinguishable from that of the
shell. The small proper motion of 1500+-1500 km/s of the central bright spot is
consistent with our previous interpretation of it as being associated with the
expected black-hole or neutron-star remnant. Now, an alternate scenario seems
also plausible, where the central bright spot, like the northeast one, results
when the shock front impacts on a condensation within the circumstellar medium
(CSM). The condensation would have to be so dense as to be opaque at cm
wavelengths (~1000x denser than the average corresponding CSM) and fortuitously
close to the center of the projected shell. We include a movie of the evolution
of SN1986J at 5 GHz from t=0 to 25 yr.

to a jammed state in a quasi-one-dimensional path is investigated. One of the
characteristic features of such a flow is that the constituent particles
spontaneously form a cluster that blocks the path, called a path-blocking
cluster (PBC), and causes a jammed state when the particle density is greater
than a threshold value. Near the threshold value, the PBC occasionally desolve
itself to recover the free flow. In other words, the time evolution of the size
of the PBC governs the flux of a counter chemotactic flow. In this paper, on
the basis of numerical results of a stochastic cellular automata (SCA) model,
we introduce a Langevin equation model for the size evolution of the PBC that
reproduces the qualitative characteristics of the SCA model. The results
suggest that the emergence of the jammed state in a quasi-one-dimensional
counter flow is caused by a saddle-node bifurcation.

favors the dimerization. In addition, by calculating the correlation exponents

were performed for fixed temperature ($ kT=0.01 $). Results indicate that, at
low temperature, the two insulator phases are separated by a metallic phase for
weak to intermediate values of the staggered potential $ \Delta $. For large
Coulomb repulsion the system is in a Mott insulator with an antiferromagnetism
order. On increasing and decreasing the Coulomb interaction $ U $ the
metal-Mott insulator transition shows an hysteresis phenomenon while the
metal-band insulator transition is continue. For large $ \Delta $ it seems that
the metallic region shrinks to a single metallic point. However, the band
insulator to the Mott insulator transition is not direct for the studied model.
A phase diagram is drawn for the temperature $ kT=0.01 $. For $ \Delta =0.5 $
cycles of increasing and decreasing temperature were programmed for different
values of the Coulomb interaction $ U $ . A behaviour change appears for $
U\simeq 1.75 $. This suggests that a crossover line divides the metallic region
of the phase diagram.

close to our line of sight to a more distant background star. The foreground
star acts as a lens, splitting the light from the source star into two images,
which are typically unresolved. However, these images are also magnified, by an
amount that depends on the angular lens-source separation. The relative
lens-source motion results in a time-variable source magnification: a
microlensing event. If the foreground star happens to host a planet with
projected separation near the paths of these images, the planet will further
perturb the images, resulting in a characteristic, short-lived signature of the
planet. This chapter provides an introduction to the discovery and
characterization of exoplanets with gravitational microlensing. The theoretical
foundation of the method is reviewed, focusing on the phenomenology of
planetary perturbations. The strengths and weaknesses of the microlensing
technique are discussed, highlighting the fact that it is sensitive to low-mass
planets with separations just beyond the snow line, orbiting stars located
throughout the Galactic disk and foreground bulge. An overview of the practice

challenges with detecting and analyzing planetary perturbations. The chapter
concludes with a review of the results that have been obtained to date, and a

Ultimately, microlensing is potentially sensitive to multiple-planet systems

to free floating planets, and will provide a crucial test of planet formation
theories by determining the demographics of planets throughout the Galaxy.

Current models of the size- and radial evolution of dust in
protoplanetary disks generally oversimplify either the radial evolution of the
disk (by focussing at one single radius or by using steady state disk models)
or they assume particle growth to proceed monodispersely or without
fragmentation. Further studies of protoplanetary disks - such as observations,
disk chemistry and structure calculations or planet population synthesis models
- depend on the distribution of dust as a function of grain size and radial
position in the disk.
  Aims. We attempt to improve upon current models to be able to investigate how
the initial conditions, the build-up phase, and the evolution of the
protoplanetary disk influence growth and transport of dust.
  Methods. We introduce a new version of the model of Brauer et al. (2008) in
which we now include the time-dependent viscous evolution of the gas disk, and
in which more advanced input physics and numerical integration methods are
implemented.
  Results. We show that grain properties, the gas pressure gradient, and the
amount of turbulence are much more influencing the evolution of dust than the
initial conditions or the build-up phase of the protoplanetary disk. We
quantify which conditions or environments are favorable for growth beyond the
meter size barrier. High gas surface densities or zonal flows may help to
overcome the problem of radial drift, however already a small amount of
turbulence poses a much stronger obstacle for grain growth.

unable to remove red giants out to 0.4 pc although brighter red giants much
closer in may be depleted via collisions with stellar-mass black holes. For a
much flatter IMF, the stellar population is dominated by compact remnants (i.e.
black holes, white dwarfs and neutron stars). The most common collisions are
then those between main-sequence stars and compact remnants. Such encounters
are likely to destroy the main-sequence stars and thus prevent their evolution
into red giants. In this way, the red-giant population could be depleted out to
0.4 pc matching observations. If this is the case, it implies the Galactic
center contains a much larger population of stellar-mass black holes than would
be expected from a regular IMF. This may in turn have implications for the
formation and growth of the central supermassive black hole.

study how these galaxies evolve. Here we present results for the early-type

the resolved stellar content of 6 galaxies, together with isochrones from the
Dartmouth stellar evolutionary models. We derive photometric metallicity
distribution functions of stars on the upper red giant branch via isochrone
interpolation. The 6 galaxies are moderately metal-poor (<[Fe/H]>=-1.56 to
-1.08), and metallicity spreads are observed (internal dispersions of
sigma_[Fe/H]=0.10 to 0.41 dex). We also investigate the possible presence of
intermediate-age stars, and discuss how these affect our results. The dwarfs
exhibit flat to weak radial metallicity gradients. For the two most luminous,
most metal-rich galaxies, we find statistically significant evidence for at
least two stellar subpopulations: the more metal-rich stars are found in the
center of the galaxies, while the metal-poor ones are more broadly distributed
within the galaxies. We find no clear trend of the derived physical properties
as a function of (present-day) galaxy position in the group, which may be due

extensions of the standard model with left-right symmetry, such as the
Pati-Salam model, where quark mass matrices are not Hermitian in general. We
construct a simple and natural measure on the space of complex matrices which

find that, unlike in the case of the standard model where the observed value
for J seemed rather typical, one would now expect to observe |J|< 10^{-7},
clearly in conflict with the observed value J $\approx$ 3 x 10^{-5}. The
crucial difference in the calculation lies in the non-Hermiticity of mass
matrices that modifies the measure. We conclude that one would need additional
assumptions modifying the measure to reproduce the observed value, and that in

limits on T-hat reveal that the masses of the LW fermions must satisfy Mq, Mt >

that the current central challenge in channeling collimation is the

Here we consider an adiabatic quantum simulator which simulates the ground
state properties of sparse Hamiltonians consisting of one- and two-local
interaction terms, using sparse Hamiltonians with at most three-local
interactions. Properties of such Hamiltonians can be well approximated with
Hamiltonians containing only two-local terms. The register holding the
simulated ground state is brought adiabatically into interaction with a probe
qubit, followed by a single diabatic gate operation on the probe which then
undergoes free evolution until measured. This allows one to recover e.g. the
ground state energy of the Hamiltonian being simulated. Given a ground state,
this scheme can be used to verify the QMA-complete problem LOCAL HAMILTONIAN,

source Gaussian measure to a target measure which is more log-concave than the
source one, which contracts Euclidean distance (in fact, Caffarelli showed that
the optimal-transport Brenier map $T_{opt}$ is a contraction in this case). We
generalize this result to more general source and target measures, using a
condition on the third derivative of the potential, using two different proofs.
The first uses a map $T$, whose inverse is constructed as a flow along an
advection field associated to an appropriate heat-diffusion process. The
contraction property is then reduced to showing that log-concavity is preserved
along the corresponding diffusion semi-group, by using a maximum principle for
parabolic PDE. In particular, Caffarelli's original result immediately follows
by using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the Pr\'ekopa--Leindler Theorem.
The second uses the map $T_{opt}$ by generalizing Caffarelli's argument,
employing in addition further results of Caffarelli. As applications, we obtain
new correlation and isoperimetric inequalities.

of the Virgo ICM. It is also associated with a discontinuity in the chemical
composition. The gas in the inner, bright region of the front is ~40% more
abundant in Fe than the gas outside the front, suggesting the important role of
sloshing in transporting metals through the ICM. For the first time, we provide
a quantitative estimate of the mass of Fe transported by a cold front. This
amounts to ~6% of the total Fe mass within the radial range affected by
sloshing, significantly more than the amount of metals transported by the AGN
in the same cluster core. The very low Fe abundance of only ~0.2 solar
immediately outside the cold front at a radius of 90 kpc suggests we are
witnessing first-hand the transport of higher metallicity gas into a pristine
region, whose abundance is typical of the cluster outskirts. The Mg/Fe and O/Fe
abundance ratios remain approximately constant over the entire radial range
between the centre of M87 and the faint side of the cold front, which requires
the presence of a centrally peaked distribution not only for Fe but also for
core-collapse type supernova products. This peak may stem from the star
formation triggered as the BCG assembled during the protocluster phase.

composed of a set of discrete lines reveling the discrete (quantum) structure

on La0.7Ca0.3Mn1-xCrxO3 manganites. Rietveld analysis of fitted and observed
XRD patterns exhibited the single-phase nature of all the studied materials,
which crystallize in Pbnm space group. Successive substitution of Cr at Mn site
in La0.7Ca0.3Mn1-xCrxO3 manganites increases the electrical resistivity and
decrease the characteristic insulator-metal transition temperature (TIM) of the
parent compound along with a hump like feature for higher Cr-content samples.
The hump structure basically signifies the onset of anti-ferromagnetic (AFM)
interactions as inferred by both the magnetic and infra-red (IR) spectroscopy
studies. The systematic suppression of FM state results in a spin glass (SG)
like behavior. IR studies revealed that the vibration mode at 413 cm-1 being
associated with internal bending of MnO6 octehedra, becomes softer, indicating
an increase in distortion and hence the possible spin glass behavior. The
critical exponents alpha, beta and gama are calculated from the heat capacity
(CP) data near the TIM/TFM. The same exhibited variations of their values with
doping. In particular the value of beta increases from 0.37 to 0.43, clearly
indicating the coexistence of both long and short range magnetic orders i.e.
tendency towards SG state for Cr doped samples. On the basis of present
results, it is suggested that Cr dilutes double-exchange (DE) based FM and
rather promotes the AFM based super exchange interactions (SE) via Cr3+/Mn4+
ions. Substitution of Cr systematically destroys both the metallic state and
long range ferromagnetic (FM) order.

candidate for dark matter studies. New HI synthesis observations of NGC 2915

combined with high-quality 3.6 $\mu$m imaging from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby

distinct HI concentrations with significantly non-Gaussian line profiles. We
fit a tilted ring model to the HI velocity field to derive a rotation curve.
This is used as input for mass models that determine the contributions from the
stellar and gas disks as well as the dark matter halo. The galaxy is
dark-matter-dominated at nearly all radii. At the last measured point of the
rotation curve, the total mass to blue light ratio is ~ 140 times solar, making

Technique on SIFT features extracted from face images. Although SIFT features
have been successfully used for general object detection and recognition, only
recently they were applied to face recognition. This paper further investigates
the performance of identification techniques based on Graph matching topology
drawn on SIFT features which are invariant to rotation, scaling and
translation. Face projections on images, represented by a graph, can be matched
onto new images by maximizing a similarity function taking into account spatial
distortions and the similarities of the local features. Two graph based
matching techniques have been investigated to deal with false pair assignment
and reducing the number of features to find the optimal feature set between
database and query face SIFT features. The experimental results, performed on
the BANCA database, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system for
automatic face identification.

In many cases, ear biometrics can be compared with face biometrics regarding

efficient ear recognition system is presented, which uses Scale Invariant
Feature Transform (SIFT) as feature descriptor for structural representation of
ear images. In order to make it more robust to user authentication, only the
regions having color probabilities in a certain ranges are considered for
invariant SIFT feature extraction, where the K-L divergence is used for keeping
color consistency. Ear skin color model is formed by Gaussian mixture model and
clustering the ear color pattern using vector quantization. Finally, K-L
divergence is applied to the GMM framework for recording the color similarity
in the specified ranges by comparing color similarity between a pair of
reference model and probe ear images. After segmentation of ear images in some
color slice regions, SIFT keypoints are extracted and an augmented vector of
extracted SIFT features are created for matching, which is accomplished between
a pair of reference model and probe ear images. The proposed technique has been
tested on the IITK Ear database and the experimental results show improvements
in recognition accuracy while invariant features are extracted from color slice
regions to maintain the robustness of the system.

its mass. The observational confirmation of this bound which we call a Kerr
bound directly suggests the existence of a black hole. In order to investigate
observational testability of this bound by using the X-ray energy spectrum of
black hole candidates, we calculate energy spectra for a super-spinning object
(or a naked singularity) which is described by a Kerr metric but whose specific
angular momentum is larger than its mass, and then compare the spectra of this
object with those of a black hole. We assume an optically thick and
geometrically thin disc around the super-spinning object and calculate its
thermal energy spectrum seen by a distant observer by solving general
relativistic radiative transfer equations including usual special and general
relativistic effects such as Doppler boosting, gravitational redshift, light
bending and frame-dragging. Surprisingly, for a given black hole, we can always
find its super-spinning counterpart with its spin $a_*$ in the range
$5/3<a_*<8\sqrt{6}/3$ whose observed spectrum is very similar to and
practically indistinguishable from that of the black hole. As a result, we
conclude that to confirm the Kerr bound we need more than the X-ray thermal

available degrees of freedom in the interference channel with an arbitrary
number of users. Most prior work on interference alignment, however, neglects
interference from other nodes in the network not participating in the alignment
operation. This paper proposes three generalizations of interference alignment
for the multiple-antenna interference channel with multiple users that account
for colored noise, which models uncoordinated interference. First, a minimum
interference-plus-noise leakage algorithm is presented, and shown to be
equivalent to previous subspace methods when noise is spatially white or
negligible. A joint minimum mean squared error design is then proposed that
jointly optimizes the transmit precoders and receive spatial filters, whereas
previous designs neglect the receive spatial filter. This algorithm is shown to
be a generalization of previous joint MMSE designs for other system
configurations such as the broadcast channel. Finally, a maximum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio algorithm is developed that is proven
to converge, unlike previous maximum SINR algorithms. The latter two designs
are shown to have increased complexity due to non-orthogonal precoders, more
required iterations, or more channel state knowledge than the min INL or
subspace methods. The sum throughput performance of these algorithms is
simulated in the context of a network with uncoordinated co-channel interferers
not participating in the alignment protocol. It is found that a network with
cochannel interference can benefit from employing precoders designed to
consider that interference, but in some cases, ignoring the co-channel
interference is advantageous.

derived in a previous paper for the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov

field is allowed to oscillate and to become complex. The new solutions are in
good agreement with the old ones and also with the result of well-known quantum

effects: they restore the particle-number symmetry which is broken in the
constant-$\Delta$ approximation and introduce the possibility of collective
eigenfrequencies of the system due to the pairing interaction. A numerical
study with values of parameters appropriate for nuclei, shows an enhancement of
the density-density strength function in the region of the low-energy giant

method and a Sobolev gradient descent method. We first address the basic issue
of the choice of the variable used to compute new metrics for the mesh
adaptivity and show that simultaneously refinement using the real and imaginary

the solution as adaptivity variable fails for complicated test cases. Then we
suggest an optimized algorithm for adapting the mesh during the evolution of
the solution towards the equilibrium state. Considerable computational time
saving is obtained compared to uniform mesh computations. The new method is
applied to compute difficult cases relevant for physical experiments (large
nonlinear interaction constant and high rotation rates).

Centaurus A (NGC 5128), situated $\sim 38\kpc$ from the centre of that galaxy,
imaged with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space
Telescope. At the distance of the galaxy, the half-light radius of the cluster
is r_h ~ 17pc, placing it among the largest globular clusters known. The faint
absolute magnitude of the star cluster, M_(V,o)=-5.2, and its large size render
this object somewhat different from the population of extended globular
clusters previously reported, making it the first firm detection in the
outskirts of a giant galaxy of an analogue of the faint, diffuse globular
clusters present in the outer halo of the Milky Way. The colour-magnitude
diagram of the cluster, covering approximately the brightest four magnitudes of
the red giant branch, is consistent with an ancient, i.e., older than ~8 Gyr,
intermediate-metallicity, i.e., [M/H] ~-1.0 dex, stellar population. We also
report the detection of a second, even fainter cluster candidate which would
have r_h ~ 9pc, and M_(V,o)=-3.4 if it is at the distance of NGC 5128. The
properties of the extended globular cluster and the diffuse stellar populations
in its close vicinity suggest that they are part of a low mass accretion in the
outer regions of NGC 5128.

low surface brightness outskirts of this galaxy are populated by multiple,

These include a giant stream, the first to be resolved into stars beyond the
Local Group using ground-based facilities, that loops around the parent galaxy

surrounded by a previously undetected large, flat and thick cocoon-like stellar

attracted considerable interest during the last few years. Various separability
criteria for pure states of N identical fermions have been recently discussed
but, excepting the case of two-fermions systems, these criteria are difficult
to implement and of limited value from the practical point of view. Here we
advance simple necessary and sufficient separability criteria for pure states
of N identical fermions. We found that to be identified as separable a state
has to comply with one single identity involving either the purity or the von
Neumann entropy of the single-particle reduced density matrix. These criteria,
based on the verification of only one identity, are drastically simpler than
the criteria discussed in the recent literature. We also derive two
inequalities verified respectively by the purity and the entropy of the single
particle, reduced density matrix, that lead to natural entanglement measures
for N-fermion pure states. Our present considerations are related to some
classical results from the Hartree-Fock theory, which are here discussed from a
different point of view in order to clarify some important points concerning
the separability of fermionic pure states.

transition. By using Ehrenfest's scheme we further prove that this is a glassy
phase transition with a Prigogine-Defay ratio close to 3. This value is well
placed within the desired bound (2 to 5) for a glassy phase transition. Thus
our analysis indicates a very close connection between the phase transition
phenomena of a black hole and glass forming systems. Finally, we discuss the

smaller in more massive systems and decreases toward the local Universe,

between the properties of HI-selected galaxies and HI absorption systems, we
argue a link between the local galaxy population and quasar absorption systems,
particularly for Damped Ly-alpha absorption (DLA) systems and sub-DLA systems.
First, we evaluate how many HI-selected galaxies exhibit HI column densities as
high as those of DLA systems. We find that HI-selected galaxies with HI masses
M(HI) > 10^8 solar masses have gaseous disks that produce HI column densities
comparable to those of DLA systems. We conclude that DLA galaxies where the HI
column densities are as high as those of DLA systems, contribute significantly
to the population of HI-selected galaxies at M(HI) > 10^8 solar masses. Second,
we find that star formation rates (SFRs) correlate tightly with HI masses
rather than B- (and J-) band luminosities.
  In the low-mass range M(HI) < 10^8 solar masses, sub-DLA galaxies replace DLA
galaxies as the dominant population. The number fraction of sub-DLA galaxies
relative to galaxies reaches 40%-60% at HI masses 10^8 solar masses and 30%-80%
at 10^7 solar masses. The HI-selected galaxies at 10^7 solar masses are a
strong probe of sub-DLA systems that place stringent constraints on galaxy
formation and evolution.

calculations for laboratory experiments show that saturation is achieved
through modification of the background shear for Pm << 1. Guided by the results
of calculations appropriate for laboratory experiments when Pm is very low, the
axisymmetric stability of inviscid disturbances in a shearing box model
immersed in a constant vertical background magnetic field is considered under a
variety of shear profiles and boundary conditions in order to evaluate the
hypothesis that modifications of the shear bring about saturation of the
instability. It is found that the emergence and stability of the MRI is
sensitive to the boundary conditions adopted. Channel modes do not appear to be
stabilized through any modification of the background shear whose average
remains Keplerian. However, systems that have non-penetrative boundaries can
saturate the MRI through modification of the background shear. Conceptually
equating the qualitative results from laboratory experiments to the conditions

Background fluctuations at the quadrupole level. We briefly discuss how higher
multipoles can also be affected, once the full structure of the quintessence
potential is taken into account.

Wireless Sensor Network. We introduce the WSN context and constraints
associated. We propose an IR-UWB solution and illustrate why it could be a
viable solution for WSN. A high level modelling and simulation platform for
IR-UWB radio interface is proposed on Matlab. It allows us to determine
according to BER versus Eb/N0 criteria and the WSN constraints what kind of
design is more adequate. Moreover, a co-design co-simulation platform Matlab
VHDL is proposed here. Using this platform we designed IR-UWB transceiver
having reconfigurable capabilities, such as data rate reconfiguration, time
hopping code, spectrum occupation and radio range reconfiguration.

contact with a solid substrate (hard wall) is studied, with special emphasis on
the region of the phase diagram that includes the smectic A phase. The
colloidal rods are modelled as hard cylinders of the same diameter and
different lengths, in the approximation of perfect alignment. A
fundamental--measure density functional is used to obtain equilibrium density
profiles and thermodynamic properties such as surface tensions and adsorption
coefficients. The bulk phase diagram exhibits nematic-smectic and
smectic-smectic demixing, with smectic phases having different compositions; in
some cases they are microfractionated. The calculated surface phase diagram of
the wall-nematic interface shows a very rich phase behavior, including layering
transitions and complete wetting at high pressures, whereby an infinitely thick
smectic film grows at the wall via an infinite sequence of stepwise
first--order layering transitions. For lower pressures complete wetting also
obtains, but here the smectic film grows in a continuous fashion. Finally, at
very low pressures, the wall-nematic interface exhibits critical adsorption by
the smectic phase, due to the second-order character of the bulk
nematic-smectic transition.

strongly influenced by the presence of fluctuations, it is of interest to study
cyclic dominance in low dimensions where these effects are the most prominent.
We here discuss rock-paper-scissors games on a one-dimensional lattice where
the interaction rates and the mobility can be species dependent. Allowing only
single site occupation, we realize mobility by exchanging individuals of
different species. When the interaction and swapping rates are symmetric, a
strongly enhanced swapping rate yields an increased mixing of the species,
leading to a mean-field like coexistence even in one-dimensional systems. This
coexistence is transient when the rates are asymmetric, and eventually only one
species will survive. Interestingly, in our spatial games the dominating
species can differ from the species that would dominate in the corresponding
nonspatial model. We identify different regimes in the parameter space and
construct the corresponding dynamical phase diagram.
