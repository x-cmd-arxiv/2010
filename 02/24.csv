small enough flat nano-elements, allows to obtain explicit expressions for
their magnetization distributions. By minimising the energy terms sequentially,
from most to the least important, magnetization distributions are expressed as
solutions of Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problem for a function of complex
variable. A number of free parameters, corresponding to positions of vortices
and anti-vortices, still remain in the expression. These parameters can be
found by computing and minimizing the total magnetic energy of the particle
with no approximations. Thus, the presented approach is a factory of realistic
Ritz functions for analytical micromagnetic calculations. These functions are
so versatile, that they may even find applications on their own (e.g. for
fitting magnetic microscopy images). Examples are given for multi-vortex
magnetization distributions in circular cylinder, and for 2-dimensional domain
walls in thin magnetic strips.

which is based on the fusion of two existing concepts. The first is the
suggestion that the proper description of classical gravitational effects is
the gauge theory of gravity in which the connection instead of the metric acts
as the dynamical variable. The resulting field equation does not then contain
the CC term. This removes the connection between the CC and the quantum vacuum
energy, and therefore addresses the {\it old} CC problem of why quantum vacuum
energy does not gravitate. The CC-equivalent in this approach arises from the
constant of integration when reducing the field equation to the Einstein
equation. The second is the assumption that the universe obeys de Sitter
symmetry, with the observed accelerating expansion as its manifestation. We
combine these ideas and identify the constant of integration with the
inverse-square of the radius of curvature of the de Sitter space. The origin of
dark energy (DE) is therefore associated with the inherent spacetime geometry,
with the smallness of DE protected by symmetry. This addresses the {\it new} CC
problem, or the DE puzzle. This approach, however, faces major challenges from
quantum considerations. These are the ghost problem associated with higher
order gravity theories and the quantum instability of the de Sitter spacetime.
We discuss their possible remedies.

question of whether this system supports a FQHE described by the non-Abelian

strength (layer separation) could lead to a transition from the Abelian
two-component Halperin 331 to non-Abelian one-component Moore-Read Pfaffian

Pfaffian regime--we establish that all so far observed FQHE states in

Abelian Halperin 331 state. In the second Landau level we make the prediction
that bilayer structures would manifest two distinct branches of incompressible
FQHE corresponding to the Abelian 331 state (at moderate to low tunneling and
large layer separation) and the non-Abelian Moore-Read Pfaffian state (at large
tunneling and small layer separation). The observation of these two FQHE

models for real-world networks and to analyze various dynamics on these models.
One particular problem of significant importance is to understand the effect of
random edge lengths or costs on the geometry and flow transporting properties
of the network. Two different regimes are of great interest, the weak disorder
regime where optimality of a path is determined by the sum of edge weights on
the path and the strong disorder regime where optimality of a path is
determined by the maximal edge weight on the path. In the context of the
stochastic mean-field model of distance, we provide the first mathematically
tractable model of weak disorder and show that no transition occurs at finite
temperature. Indeed, we show that for every finite temperature, the number of
edges on the minimal weight path (i.e., the hopcount) is $\Theta(\log{n})$ and
satisfies a central limit theorem with asymptotic means and variances of order
$\Theta(\log{n})$, with limiting constants expressible in terms of the
Malthusian rate of growth and the mean of the stable-age distribution of an
associated continuous-time branching process. More precisely, we take
independent and identically distributed edge weights with distribution $E^s$
for some parameter $s>0$, where $E$ is an exponential random variable with mean
1. Then the asymptotic mean and variance of the central limit theorem for the
hopcount are $s\log{n}$ and $s^2\log{n}$, respectively. We also find limiting
distributional asymptotics for the value of the minimal weight path in terms of
extreme value distributions and martingale limits of branching processes.

bulges of S0s are different from the elliptical galaxies, which is manifested
in the M_K(bulge) vs r_{eff} relation, in the photometric plane, and to some
extent also in the Kormendy relation. The bulges of S0s are similar to bulges
of spirals with M_K(bulge) < -20 mag. Some S0s have small bulges, but their

galaxy harassment. (4) The relative bulge flux B/T for S0s covers the full

spiral galaxies with bulges brighter than -20 mag in the K-band can evolve

variations that can be mistaken as planets. Large spots crossing the stellar
disc can produce planet-like periodic variations in the light curve of a star.
These spots clearly affect the spectral line profiles and their perturbations
alter the line centroids creating a radial velocity jitter that might
contaminate"" the variations induced by a planet. Precise chromospheric activity
measurements are needed to estimate the activity-induced noise that should be
expected for a given star. Aims: We obtain precise chromospheric activity
measurements and projected rotational velocities for nearby (d < 25 pc) cool
(spectral types F to K) stars, to estimate their expected activity-related
jitter. As a complementary objective, we attempt to obtain relationships
between fluxes in different activity indicator lines, that permit a
transformation of traditional activity indicators, i.e, CaII H & K lines, to
others that hold noteworthy advantages. Methods: We used high resolution
(~50000) echelle optical spectra. To determine the chromospheric emission of
the stars in the sample, we used the spectral subtraction technique. Rotational
velocities were determined using the cross-correlation technique. To infer
activity-related radial velocity (RV) jitter, we used empirical relationships
between this jitter and the R'_HK index. Results: We measured chromospheric
activity, as given by different indicators throughout the optical spectra, and
projected rotational velocities for 371 nearby cool stars. We have built
empirical relationships among the most important chromospheric emission lines.
Finally, we used the measured chromospheric activity to estimate the expected
RV jitter for the active stars in the sample.

supersymmetric standard model is augmented with a right-chiral neutrino
superfield for each generation. Such a scenario can have a lightest
supersymmetric particle (LSP) dominated by the right-chiral sneutrino state and
the lighter stau as the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). This
can easily be motivated by assuming a high scale framework of supersymmetry
breaking like minimal supergravity (mSUGRA). Due to the extremely small
neutrino Yukawa coupling, the decay of the NLSP to the LSP is suppressed and
consequently the NLSP, here the lighter stau mass eigenstate, becomes stable at
the length scale of the detector. The collider signal in this case consists of
charged tracks of massive stable particles in the muon chamber. Following up on
our earlier studies on neutralino and chargino reconstruction in such a
scenario, we have shown the kinematical information obtained from these charged
tracks allows us to reconstruct the left-chiral tau-sneutrino as well over a
significant region of the mSUGRA parameter space. Two methods for
reconstruction are suggested and their relative merits are discussed.

and codes to $s \ge \frac 12$ for both the ground and excited states, and
independently to ""generalised"" expectation values for a wide range of one- and
two-body spin operators. An advantage of the CCM is that the Goldstone
linked-cluster theorem is obeyed at all levels of approximation and so it
provides results in the infinite lattice limit $N \to \infty$ from the outset.
However, recent results have also shown that the CCM can provide exact
(symmetry-breaking) results for the spin-half linear-chain $J_1$--$J_2$ at the
Majumdar-Ghosh point $J_2/J_1=0.5$ by identifying special solutions of the CCM
equations for the usual N\'eel model state. Interestingly, the CCM provides
exact (non-symmetry-breaking) results for systems in which small magnetic
clusters become de-coupled from each other when the bonds connecting them tend
to zero. These exact results involve the identification of ""special solutions""
of the CCM equations for the N\'eel state. An example of this is given by a
spin-half system with nearest-neighbour bonds for an underlying lattice
corresponding to the magnetic material CaV$_4$O$_9$ (CAVO) in which one of the
two different types of bonds on the lattice tend to zero. Larger finite-sized
systems may be considered by appropriate choice of the unit cell and the bonds
on it. We show here that exact diagonalisation results for ground-state energy
and excitation energy gap for the spin-half and spin-one linear Heisenberg
model on chains of length up to N=12 sites for s=1/2 and N=6 sites for s=1 with

as the network is confined or as water interacts with surfaces. These changes
have been observed to be large on a chemical scale for water confined in carbon
nanotubes and in the pores of xerogel, and may play a fundamental, and
neglected, role in biological processes involving confined water. We measure
the average momentum distribution of the protons in salmon Na-DNA using Deep
Inelastic Neutron Scattering, for a weakly hydrated (6w/bp) and a dehydrated

energy of the system per water molecule removed from the DNA and placed in the

the same process, demonstrating that changes in the zero point motion of the
protons, arising from changes in structure as water molecules are incorporated
in the DNA, are a significant factor in the energetics of the transition from
the A to B phase with hydration, in this case, providing the entire binding

opportunity for a statistical analysis of IMF variations and correlations

scenario involves star formation in small-n clusters which then progressively
merge; the first stars to form are seeds of massive stars and achieve a
headstart in mass acquisition. These massive seeds end up in the cores of
clusters and a large fraction of new stars of lower mass is formed in the outer
parts of the clusters. The resulting clusters are therefore mass segregated at
an age of 0.5 Myr, although the signature of mass segregation is weakened
during mergers. We find that the resulting IMF has a smaller exponent
(alpha=1.8-2.2) than the Salpeter value (alpha=2.35). The IMFs in subclusters
are truncated at masses only somewhat larger than the most massive stars (which
depends on the richness of the cluster) and an universal upper mass limit of
150 Msun is ruled out. We also find that the simulations show signs of the
IGIMF effect proposed by Weidner & Kroupa, where the frequency of massive stars
is suppressed in the integrated IMF compared to the IMF in individual clusters.
We identify clusters through the use of a minimum spanning tree algorithm which
allows easy comparison between observational survey data and the predictions of
turbulent fragmentation models. In particular we present quantitative
predictions regarding properties such as cluster morphology, degree of mass
segregation, upper slope of the IMF and the relation between cluster richness

that for three of the IFSs a correction for so-called cross-talk due to

spectra will be inaccurate, in particular if there is a significant intensity
gradient across the object. Our tests showed that p3d is able to produce

simple and accurate approximate solutions for the large scale flow,showing that
a backflow towards the few inner parsec region develops. We solve the
appropriate fluid dynamic equations, and we use these solutions to predict the
mass inflow rates towards the central regions. We then perform a series of 2D

bulk techniques to the study of paraffin coatings, in order to characterize the
properties that enable the effective preservation of alkali spin polarization.
These methods include Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential
scanning calorimetry, atomic force microscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine

the light-induced atomic desorption yields of several different paraffin
materials. Experimental results include the determination that crystallinity of
the coating material is unnecessary, and the detection of C=C double bonds
present within a particular class of effective paraffin coatings. Further study
should lead to the development of more robust paraffin anti-relaxation
coatings, as well as the design and synthesis of new classes of coating
materials.

Survey Data Release 4 (SDSS DR4) to investigate in what environments galaxy
mergers occur and how the results of these mergers depend on differences in
local galaxy density. The galaxies are quantified morphologically using
two-dimensional bulge-plus-disk decompositions and compared to a control sample
matched in stellar mass, redshift and local projected density. Lower density
environments have fractionally more galaxy pairs with small projected
separations (r_p) and relative velocities (Delta v), but even high density
environments contain significant populations of pairs with parameters that
should be conducive to interactions. Metrics of asymmetry and colour are used
to identify merger activity and triggered star formation. The location of star
formation is inferred by distinguishing bulge and disk colours and calculating
bulge fractions from the SDSS images. Galaxies in the lowest density
environments show the largest changes in star formation rate, asymmetry and
bulge-total fractions at small separations, accompanied by bluer bulge colours.
At the highest local densities, the only galaxy property to show an enhancement
in the closest pairs is asymmetry. We interpret these results as evidence that
whilst interactions (leading to tidal distortions) occur at all densities,
triggered star formation is seen only in low-to-intermediate density
environments. We suggest that this is likely due to the typically higher gas
fractions of galaxies in low density environments. Finally, by
cross-correlating our sample of galaxy pairs with a cluster catalogue, we
investigate the dependence of interactions on clustercentric distance. It is
found that for close pairs the fraction of asymmetric galaxies is highest in
the cluster centres.

$l$ is the Coriolis parameter and $b_0$ is the height-averaged vorticity at the
center of cyclone.

previously in spherical nuclei, i.e., it is maximal in the interior of the
nucleus and then it is decreasing rather fast in the surface region where it
reaches a minimal value of about 2 fm. This minimal value of the coherence
length in the surface is essentially determined by the finite size properties
of single-particle states in the vicinity of the chemical potential and has
little to do with enhanced pairing correlations in the nuclear surface. It is
shown that in nuclei the coherence length is not a good indicator of the
intensity of pairing correlations. This feature is contrasted with the
situation in infinite matter.

of nondenumerability are refuted by analyzing the logical inconsistencies in
implementation of the reductio method of proof and by identifying errors.
Particular attention is given to the diagonalization argument and to the
interpretation of the axiom of infinity. ii) Three constructive proofs have
been designed that support the denumerability of the power set of the natural
numbers, P(N), thus implying the denumerability of the set of the real numbers
R. These results lead to a Theorem of the Continuum that supersedes Cantor's
Continuum Hypothesis and establishes the countable nature of the real number
line, suggesting that all infinite sets are denumerable. Some immediate
implications of denumerability are discussed: i) Valid proofs should not
include inconceivable statements, defined as statements that can be found to be
false and always lead to contradiction. This is formalized in a Principle of
Conceivable Proof. ii) Substantial simplification of the axiomatic principles
of set theory can be achieved by excluding transfinite numbers. To facilitate
the comparison of sets, infinite as well as finite, the concept of relative
cardinality is introduced. iii) Proofs of incompleteness that use diagonal
arguments (e.g. those used in Godel's Theorems) are refuted. A constructive
proof, based on the denumerability of P(N), is presented to demonstrate the
existence of a theory of first-order arithmetic that is consistent, sound,
negation-complete, decidable and (assumed p.r. adequate) able to prove its own
consistency. Such a result reinstates Hilbert's Programme and brings arithmetic
completeness to the forefront of mathematics.

microarray data, however, interpretation of aCGH output is a difficult and
error-prone task.
  In this work, we tackle the computational task of inferring the DNA copy
number per genomic position from noisy aCGH data. We propose CGHTRIMMER, a
novel segmentation method that uses a fast dynamic programming algorithm to
solve for a least-squares objective function for copy number assignment.
CGHTRIMMER consistently achieves superior precision and recall to leading
competitors on benchmarks of synthetic data and real data from the Coriell cell
lines. In addition, it finds several novel markers not recorded in the
benchmarks but plausibly supported in the oncology literature. Furthermore,
CGHTRIMMER achieves superior results with run-times from 1 to 3 orders of
magnitude faster than its state-of-art competitors.
  CGHTRIMMER provides a new alternative for the problem of aCGH discretization
that provides superior detection of fine-scale regions of gain or loss yet is
fast enough to process very large data sets in seconds. It thus meets an
important need for methods capable of handling the vast amounts of data being
accumulated in high-throughput studies of tumor genetics.

along the chain. The system is driven out of equilibrium in two ways: a). by
rapidly turning off the magnetic field, b). by rapidly quenching the
interactions at the same time as the magnetic field is turned off. The
time-evolution of the domain wall profile as well as various two-point spin

for the $XX$ chain and via a bosonization approach and a mean-field approach
for the $XXZ$ chain. At long times the magnetization is found to equilibrate
(reach the ground state value), while the two-point correlation functions in
general do not. In particular, for quenches within the gapless $XX$ phase, the
transverse spin correlation functions acquire a spatially inhomogeneous
structure at long times whose details depend on the initial domain wall
profile. The spatial inhomogeneity is also recovered for the case of classical
spins initially arranged in a domain wall profile and shows that the
inhomogeneities arise due to the dephasing of transverse spin components as the
domain wall broadens. A generalized Gibbs ensemble approach is found to be
inadequate in capturing this spatially inhomogeneous state.

mass and radius. The particularly interesting property of Neptune-sized planets
is that their mass Mp and radius Rp are close to theoretical M-R relations of
water planets. Given Mp, Rp, and equilibrium temperature, however, various
internal compositions are possible. A broad set of interior structure models is
presented here that illustrates the dependence of internal composition and
possible phases of water occurring in presumably water-rich planets, such as GJ
436b on the uncertainty in atmospheric temperature profile and mean density. We
show how the set of solutions can be narrowed down if theoretical constraints
from formation and model atmospheres are applied or potentially observational
constraints for the atmospheric metallicity Z1 and the tidal Love number k2. We
model the interior by assuming either three layers (hydrogen-helium envelope,
water layer, rock core) or two layers (H/He/H2O envelope, rocky core). For
water, we use the equation of state H2O-REOS based on FT-DFT-MD simulations.
Some admixture of H/He appears mandatory for explaining the measured radius.
For the warmest considered models, the H/He mass fraction can reduce to 10^-3,
still extending over ~0.7 REarth. If water occurs, it will be essentially in
the plasma phase or in the superionic phase, but not in an ice phase.
Metal-free envelope models have 0.02<k2<0.2, and the core mass cannot be
determined from a measurement of k2. In contrast, models with 0.3<k2<0.82
require high metallicities Z1<0.89 in the outer envelope. The uncertainty in
core mass decreases to 0.4 Mp, if k2>0.3, and further to 0.2 Mp, if k2>0.5, and
core mass and Z1 become sensitive functions of k2. To further narrow the set of
solutions, a proper treatment of the atmosphere and the evolution is necessary.

theory. Any hint of the existence of the first order phase transition and,
particularly, its critical point will be valuable towards a full understanding
of the QCD phase diagram. We use lattice simulation based on the canonical
ensemble method to explore the finite baryon density and finite temperature
region and look for the QCD critical point. As a benchmark, we run simulations
for the four degenerate flavor QCD where we observe a clear signal of the
expected first order phase transition. In the two flavor case, we do not see
any signal for temperatures as low as $0.83 \rm{T_c}$. Although our real world
contains two light quarks and one heavier quark, three degenerate flavor case
shares a lot of similar phase structures as the QCD. We scan the phase diagram

The baryon chemical potential is measured as we increase the baryon number and
we see the characteristic ""S-shape"" that signals the first order phase
transition. We determine the phase boundaries by Maxwell construction and

using multiple sensors. We consider a diversity scheme where only the sensor
with the best channel sends their measurements over a fading channel to a
fusion center, using the analog amplify and forwarding technique. The fusion
centre reconstructs an MMSE estimate of the source based on the received
measurements. A distributed version of the diversity scheme where sensors
decide whether to transmit based only on their local channel information is
also considered. We derive asymptotic expressions for the expected distortion
(of the MMSE estimate at the fusion centre) of these schemes as the number of
sensors becomes large. For comparison, asymptotic expressions for the expected
distortion for a coherent multi-access scheme and an orthogonal access scheme
are derived. We also study for the diversity schemes, the optimal power
allocation for minimizing the expected distortion subject to average total
power constraints. The effect of optimizing the probability of transmission on
the expected distortion in the distributed scenario is also studied. It is seen
that as opposed to the coherent multi-access scheme and the orthogonal scheme
(where the expected distortion decays as 1/M, M being the number of sensors),
the expected distortion decays only as 1/ln(M) for the diversity schemes. This
reduction of the decay rate can be seen as a tradeoff between the simplicity of
the diversity schemes and the strict synchronization and large bandwidth
requirements for the coherent multi-access and the orthogonal schemes,
respectively.

measured (beam corrected) distribution of apparent axial ratios in the HI 21cm
images of dwarf irregular galaxies observed as part of the Faint Irregular
Galaxy GMRT Survey (FIGGS). Assuming that the disks can be approximated as
oblate spheroids, the intrinsic axial ratio distribution can be obtained from
the observed apparent axial ratio distribution. We use a couple of methods to
do this, and our final results are based on using Lucy's deconvolution
algorithm. This method is constrained to produce physically plausible
distributions, and also has the added advantage of allowing for observational
errors to be accounted for. While one might a priori expect that gas disks
would be thin (because collisions between gas clouds would cause them to
quickly settle down to a thin disk), we find that the HI disks of faint dwarf
irregulars are quite thick, with mean axial ratio <q> ~ 0.6. While this is
substantially larger than the typical value of ~ 0.2 for the 'stellar' disks of
large spiral galaxies, it is consistent with the much larger ratio of velocity
dispersion to rotational velocity (sigma/v_c) in dwarf galaxy HI disks as
compared to that in spiral galaxies. Our findings have implications for studies
of the mass distribution in and the Tully - Fisher relation for faint dwarf
irregular galaxies, where it is often assumed that the gas is in a thin disk.

We find that the entanglement generation is suppressed remarkably in

of the entanglement generation at QCP can be compensated both by increasing the
DM interaction and by decreasing the anisotropy of the spin chain. Beyond the
weak-coupling region, there exist resonance peaks of concurrence when the

identified in runB and their corresponding dark matter haloes in runDM have
very similar spatial distributions and dynamical properties on large scales.
Then, when analyzing the velocity field and the deviation from a pure Hubble
flow in both simulations, namely when computing the dispersion of peculiar
velocities of galaxies \sigma*(R) and those of their corresponding dark matter
haloes in runDM, we found no particular differences for distances R=1 to 8 Mpc

During the transport step, anisotropy of proteins and their complexes is
important both for hydrodynamic diffusion and accessibility of the binding
site. Using a Brownian dynamics approach and extensive computer simulations, we
quantify the effect of anisotropy on the encounter rate of ellipsoidal
particles covered with spherical encounter patches. We show that the encounter
rate $k$ depends on the aspect ratios $\xi$ mainly through steric effects,
while anisotropic diffusion has only a little effect. Calculating analytically
the crossover times from anisotropic to isotropic diffusion in three

times, in agreement with our numerical results.

normality results are established. Most importantly, the contours generated by
those quantiles are shown to coincide with the classical halfspace depth
contours associated with the name of Tukey. This relation does not only allow
for efficient depth contour computations by means of parametric linear

duality opens the way to promising developments in depth-related multivariate
rank-based inference.

which introduce large model dependence to its predictions on charmless B
decays. The amplitudes of charmless B decays can be decomposed into ""tree"" and
""penguin"" parts which are conventionally defined, not from the topology of the
dominant diagrams, but through their associated CKM factors V_{ub}^* V_{uq} and
V_{tb}^* V_{tq}, respectively, with q=d,s. We find that for B_{d,s} \to \pi^+
K^- decays, the ""tree"" amplitude can be well estimated in QCDF with small
errors, as the endpoint singularities have been canceled to a large extent.
With this as the only input from QCDF and combined with flavor symmetry, the
branching ratio of B_s \to \pi^+ K^- are estimated to be significantly larger
than the CDF measurement. This contradiction could be solved if the form factor
F^{B_s K} is smaller than the light cone sum rules estimation or the ""tree""
amplitude has been over estimated in QCDF. The latter possibility could happen
if charming penguins are nonperturbative and not small, as argued in soft
collinear effective theory. To differentiate between these two possibilities,
we examine the similar B_s \to \rho^+ K^- decay with the same technique. It is
found that a large part of the uncertainties are canceled in the ratio B(B_s
\to \rho^+ K^-)/B(B_s \to \pi^+ K^-). It is predicted to be 2.5 \pm 0.2 in QCDF
which is independent on the form factor. However if charming penguins are
important, this ratio could be very different from the QCDF prediction.
Therefore the ratio of these two branching ratios could be an interesting
indicator of the role of charming penguins in charmless B decays.

the horizontal visibility algorithm, a geometrically simpler and analytically
solvable version of our former algorithm, focusing on the mapping of random
series (series of independent identically distributed random variables). After
presenting some properties of the algorithm, we present exact results on the
topological properties of graphs associated to random series, namely the degree
distribution, clustering coefficient, and mean path length. We show that the
horizontal visibility algorithm stands as a simple method to discriminate
randomness in time series, since any random series maps to a graph with an
exponential degree distribution of the shape P(k) = (1/3)(2/3)**(k-2),
independently of the probability distribution from which the series was
generated. Accordingly, visibility graphs with other P(k) are related to
non-random series. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of the theorems
for finite series. In a second part, we show that the method is able to
distinguish chaotic series from i.i.d. theory, studying the following
situations: (i) noise-free low-dimensional chaotic series, (ii) low-dimensional
noisy chaotic series, even in the presence of large amounts of noise, and (iii)
high-dimensional chaotic series (coupled map lattice), without needs for
additional techniques such as surrogate data or noise reduction methods.

effect of feedback from supernovae (SNe) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) on
the evolution of galaxy cluster X-ray scaling relations. Our simulations are
drawn from the Millennium Gas Project and are some of the largest
hydrodynamical N-body simulations ever carried out. Feedback is implemented
using a hybrid scheme, where the energy input into intracluster gas by SNe and
AGN is taken from a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. This ensures that
the source of feedback is a population of galaxies that closely resembles that
found in the real universe. We show that our feedback model is capable of
reproducing observed local X-ray scaling laws, at least for non-cool core
clusters, but that almost identical results can be obtained with a simplistic
preheating model. However, we demonstrate that the two models predict opposing
evolutionary behaviour. We have examined whether the evolution predicted by our
feedback model is compatible with observations of high-redshift clusters.
Broadly speaking, we find that the data seems to favour the feedback model for
z<0.5, and the preheating model at higher redshift. However, a statistically
meaningful comparison with observations is impossible, because the large
samples of high-redshift clusters currently available are prone to strong
selection biases. As the observational picture becomes clearer in the near
future, it should be possible to place tight constraints on the evolution of
the scaling laws, providing us with an invaluable probe of the physical
processes operating in galaxy clusters.

identification. We present a method to efficiently calculate these excitation
lines in weakly coupled, gateable single-molecule junctions, using a

method takes transitions from excited to excited vibrational state into account
by evaluating the Franck-Condon factors for an arbitrary number of vibrational
quanta, and is therefore able to predict qualitatively different behaviour from
calculations limited to transitions from ground state to excited vibrational
state. We find that the vibrational spectrum is sensitive to the molecular
contact geometry and the charge state, and that it is generally necessary to
take more than one vibrational quantum into account. Quantitative comparison to
previously reported measurements on pi-conjugated molecules reveals that our
method is able to characterize the vibrational excitations and can be used to
identify single molecules in a junction. The method is computationally feasible
on commodity hardware.

series, forming an alternate stacking of kagome and triangular layers. Neutron
powder diffraction reveals, that this compound exhibits the largest distortion
within the 114 series, characterized by a strong buckling of the kagome layers.
Differently from all other members it shows charge ordering, with Co2+ sitting
on two sites (Co2, Co3) and mixed valent cobalt Co3+/Co2+L sitting on two other
sites (Co1, Co4). The unique ferrimagnetic structure of this cobaltite at 4 K
can be described as the assemblage of ferrimagnetic triple chains (Co1 Co2 Co3)
running perpendicular to the kagome layers, ferromagnetically coupled within
the layers, and antiferromagnetically coupled with a fourth cobalt species Co4.
The lifting of the geometrical frustration towards ferrimagnetism, which
appears in spite of the triangular topology of the cobalt lattice, is explained
by the very large structural distortion, charge ordering phenomena and large
cobalt valence compared to other LnBaCo4O7 oxides.

complexes and superclouds in a spiral arm, and other properties of the latter.
A regular string of star complexes is located in the north-western arm of M31;
they have about the same size 0.6 kpc with spacing of 1.1 kpc. Within the same
arm segment the regular magnetic field with the wavelength of 2.3 kpc was found
by Beck et al. (1989). We noted that this wavelength is twice as large as the
spacing between complexes and suggested that they were formed in result of
magneto-gravitational instability developed along the arm. In this NW arm, star
complexes are located inside the gas-dust lane, whilst in the south-western arm
of M31 the gas-dust lane is upstream of the bright and uniform stellar arm.
Earlier, evidence for the age gradient has been found in the SW arm. All these
are signatures of a spiral shock, which may be associated with unusually large
(for M31) pitch-angle of this SW arm segment. Such a shock may prevent the
formation of the regular magnetic field, which might explain the absence of
star complexes there. Anti-correlation between shock wave signatures and
presence of star complexes is observed in spiral arms of a few other galaxies.
Regular chains of star complexes and superclouds in spiral arms are rare, which
may imply that a rather specific mechanism is involved in their formation, and
the most probable one is the Parker-Jeans instability. The spiral pattern of
our Galaxy is briefly discussed; it may be of M101 type in the outer parts. The
regular bi-modal spacing of HI superclouds is found in Carina and Cygnus
(Outer) arms, which may be an indirect evidence for the regular magnetic field
along these arms.

Monge-Amp\`ere equation $(dd^c E)^{n+1}=0$.
  We also prove that if $M$ and $\omega$ are real analytic then the

sense that each processor sends only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ bits, where $n$ is

against an \emph{adaptive adversary}, which can take over processors at any
time during the protocol, up to the point of taking over arbitrarily close to a
1/3 fraction. We assume synchronous communication but a \emph{rushing}
adversary. Moreover, our algorithm works in the presence of flooding:
processors controlled by the adversary can send out any number of messages. We
assume the existence of private channels between all pairs of processors but
make no other cryptographic assumptions. Finally, our algorithm has latency
that is polylogarithmic in $n$. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first
algorithm to solve Byzantine agreement against an adaptive adversary, while
requiring $o(n^{2})$ total bits of communication.

simulations of jets that cross the stellar wind with the code Ratpenat. The jet
head generates a strong shock in the wind, and strong recollimation shocks
occur due to the initial overpressure of the jet with its environment. These
shocks can accelerate particles up to TeV energies and produce gamma-rays. The
recollimation shock also strengthens jet asymmetric Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities produced in the wind/jet contact discontinuity. This can lead to
jet disruption even for jet powers of several times $10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
High-mass microquasar jets likely suffer a strong recollimation shock that can
be a site of particle acceleration up to very high energies, but also
eventually lead to the disruption of the jet.

mass of galaxy haloes from samples of discrete positional and kinematical data
of tracers, such as halo stars, globular clusters and dwarf satellites. The
data may be projected positions, distances, line of sight velocities or proper
motions. Forms of the estimator tailored for the Milky Way galaxy and for M31
are given. Monte Carlo simulations are used to quantify the uncertainty as a
function of sample size. For the Milky Way, the satellite sample consists of 26
galaxies with line-of-sight velocities. We find that the mass of the Milky Way
within 300 kpc is ~ 0.9 x 10^12 solar masses assuming velocity isotropy.
However, the mass estimate is sensitive to the anisotropy and could plausibly
lie between 0.7 - 3.4 x 10^12 solar masses. Incorporating the proper motions of
6 Milky Way satellites into the dataset, we find ~ 1.4 x 10^12 solar masses.
The range here if plausible anisotropies are used is still broader, from 1.2 -
2.7 x 10^12 solar masses. For M31, there are 23 satellite galaxies with
measured line-of-sight velocities, but only M33 and IC 10 have proper motions.
We use the line of sight velocities and distances of the satellite galaxies to
estimate the mass of M31 within 300 kpc as ~ 1.4 x 10^12 solar masses assuming
isotropy. There is only a modest dependence on anisotropy, with the mass
varying between 1.3 -1.6 x 10^12 solar masses. Given the uncertainties, we
conclude that the satellite data by themselves yield no reliable insights into
which of the two galaxies is actually the more massive.
