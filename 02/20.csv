surface of the Sun. This emergence is usually associated with the rise of
buoyant magnetic flux structures. Here we ask how magnetic fields from a

buoyancy. The computational domain is split into two parts. In the lower part,
which we refer to as the turbulence zone, the flow is driven by an assumed
helical forcing function leading to dynamo action. Above this region, which we

structures are found to emerge in the exterior above the turbulence zone.
Strong current sheets tend to form above the neutral line, where the vertical
field component vanishes. Time series of the magnetic field structure show
recurrent plasmoid ejections. The degree to which the exterior field is force
free is estimated as the ratio of the dot product of current density and
magnetic field strength to their respective rms values. This ratio reaches
values of up to 95% in the exterior. A weak outward flow is driven by the

an improved source position. To further reinforce the intermediate mass black

establish whether it could potentially form and nourish a black hole at the

determine a source position of RA=01h10m28.3s and Dec=-46d04'22.3"". A

suggests that the far-UV emission is stronger than the near-UV. This could
imply that HLX-1 may be situated near the edge of a star forming region. Using

show that, on all range queries, mzRTree outperforms other known structures

discs. The planet is found to experience cyclic episodes of rapid decay in
orbital radius, each amounting to a few Hill radii. We find this to be due to
the scattering of large- scale vortices present in the disc. The origin and
role of vortices in the context of type III migration is explored. It is shown
through numerical simulations and semi- analytical modelling that spiral shocks
induced by a sufficiently massive planet will extend close to the planet
orbital radius. The production of vortensity across shock tips results in thin
high vortensity rings with a characteristic width of the local scale height.
For planets with masses equal to and above that of Saturn, the rings are
co-orbital features extending the entire azimuth. Linear stability analysis
show there exists unstable modes that are localised about local vortensity
minima which coincide with gap edges. Simulations show that vortices are
non-linear a outcome. We used hydrodynamic simulations to examine vortex-planet
interactions. Their effect is present in discs with kinematic viscosity less
than about an order of magnitude smaller than the typically adopted value of
\nu = 10^{-5}\Omega_pr_p(0)^2, where r_p(0) and \Omega_p are the initial
orbital radius and angular velocity of the planet respectively. We find that
the magnitude of viscosity affects the nature of type III migration but not the
extent of the orbital decay. The role of vortices as a function of initial disc
mass is also explored and it is found that the amount of orbital decay during
one episode of vortex-planet interaction is independent of initial disc mass.
We incorporate the concept of the co-orbital mass deficit in the analysis of
our results and link it to the presence of vortices at gap edges.

that would not be present in a purely hydrodynamical gas. The necessary
ingredients for growth include a negative radial entropy gradient (of any
magnitude), weak magnetic fields, and efficient resistive diffusion (in
comparison with thermal diffusion). The character of the instability is local,
axisymmetric, and double-diffusive, and it attacks lengths much shorter than
the resistive scale. Like the axisymmetric convective instability, it draws its
energy from the negative radial entropy gradient; but by utilising the
diffusing magnetic field, it can negate the stabilising influence of rotation.
Its nonlinear saturated state, while not transporting appreciable angular
momentum, could drive radial and vertical mixing, which may influence the
temperature structure of the disk, dust dynamics and, potentially, planet
formation.

varying vacancy density, the dynamics with agents making deterministic

Three regimes of qualitatively different behavior are identified depending on

invariant mass of the final-state hadronic system W~2.4 GeV with four-momentum

measurements of the inclusive electron scattering off proton and deuteron,
which cover a similar continuous two-dimensional region of Q2 and Bjorken

By using these, as well as other world data, we evaluated the F2 structure
function and its moments. Using an OPE-based twist expansion, we studied the
Q2-evolution of the moments, obtaining a separation of the leading-twist and
the total higher-twist terms. The carbon-to-deuteron ratio of the leading-twist
contributions to the F2 moments exhibits the well known EMC effect, compatible
with that discovered previously in x-space. The total higher-twist term in the
carbon nucleus appears, although with large systematic uncertainites, to be
smaller with respect to the deuteron case for n<7, suggesting partial parton
deconfinement in nuclear matter. We speculate that the spatial extension of the
nucleon is changed when it is immersed in the nuclear medium.

subspace problem of nilpotent operators as recently studied by C. M. Ringel and
M. Schmidmeier, a problem with a longstanding history going back to G.
Birkhoff. The link is established via weighted projective lines and (stable)
categories of vector bundles on those. The setup yields a new approach to
attack the subspace problem. In particular, we deduce the main results of
Ringel and Schmidmeier for nilpotency degree p from properties of the category
of vector bundles on the weighted projective line of weight type (2,3,p),
obtained by Serre construction from the triangle singularity x^2+y^3+z^p. For
p=6 the Ringel-Schmidmeier classification is thus covered by the classification
of vector bundles for tubular type (2,3,6), and then is closely related to
Atiyah's classification of vector bundles on a smooth elliptic curve. Returning
to the general case, we establish that the stable categories associated to
vector bundles or invariant subspaces of nilpotent operators may be naturally
identified as triangulated categories. They satisfy Serre duality and also have
tilting objects whose endomorphism rings play a role in singularity theory. In
fact, we thus obtain a whole sequence of triangulated (fractional) Calabi-Yau
categories, indexed by p, which naturally form an ADE-chain.

quantitative analysis of physical and biological systems, such as the
generation of action potentials by nerve cells, the release and reuptake of

we present an extension of renewal theory to describe ensembles of point
processes with time varying input. This is made possible by a representation in
terms of occupation numbers of two states: Active and refractory. The dynamics
of these occupation numbers follows a distributed delay differential equation.
In particular, our theory enables us to uncover the effect of refractoriness on
the time-dependent rate of an ensemble of encoding point processes in response
to modulation of the input. We present exact solutions that demonstrate generic
features, such as stochastic transients and oscillations in the step response
as well as resonances, phase jumps and frequency doubling in the transfer of
periodic signals. We show that a large class of renewal processes can indeed be
regarded as special cases of the model we analyze. Hence our approach
represents a widely applicable framework to define and analyze non-stationary
renewal processes.

populated with RRLs, which serve as ideal probes of the physical conditions in

shows that RRLs of higher principal quantum number (n>90) are generally
divergent from their expected Gaussian profiles and, moreover, are well
described by their respective Voigt profiles. This is in agreement with the
theory that spectral lines experience pressure broadening as a result of
electron collisions at lower radio frequencies. Given the inherent technical
difficulties regarding the detection and profiling of true RRL wing spans and
shapes, it is crucial that the observing instrumentation produce flat baselines
as well as high sensitivity, high resolution data. The GBT has demonstrated its
capabilities regarding all of these aspects, and we believe that future

Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter candidates annihilating into various

diffuse gamma-ray background by the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. The expected isotropic diffuse signal from dark
matter annihilation has contributions from the local Milky Way (MW) as well as
from extragalactic dark matter. The signal from the MW is very insensitive to
the adopted dark matter profile of the halos, and dominates the signal from
extragalactic halos, which is sensitive to the low mass cut-off of the halo
mass function. We adopt a conservative model for both the low halo mass
survival cut-off and the substructure boost factor of the Galactic and
extragalactic components, and only consider the primary final state radiation.
This provides robust constraints which reach the thermal production
cross-section for low mass WIMPs annihilating into hadronic modes. We also
reanalyze limits from HESS observations of the Galactic Ridge region using a
conservative model for the dark matter halo profile. When combined with the
HESS constraint, the isotropic diffuse spectrum rules out all interpretations
of the PAMELA positron excess based on dark matter annihilation into two lepton
final states. Annihilation into four leptons through new intermediate states,
although constrained by the data, is not excluded.

properties of long-range power-law correlated and anti-correlated signals,
quantified by the detrended fluctuation analysis. Specifically, for
coarse-graining in the magnitude of a signal, we consider (i) the Floor, (ii)
the Symmetry and (iii) the Centro-Symmetry coarse-graining methods. We find,
that for anti-correlated signals coarse-graining in the magnitude leads to a
crossover to random behavior at large scales, and that with increasing the
width of the coarse-graining partition interval $\Delta$ this crossover moves
to intermediate and small scales. In contrast, the scaling of positively
correlated signals is less affected by the coarse-graining, with no observable
changes when $\Delta<1$, while for $\Delta>1$ a crossover appears at small
scales and moves to intermediate and large scales with increasing $\Delta$. For
very rough coarse-graining ($\Delta>3$) based on the Floor and Symmetry
methods, the position of the crossover stabilizes, in contrast to the
Centro-Symmetry method where the crossover continuously moves across scales and
leads to a random behavior at all scales, thus indicating a much stronger
effect of the Centro-Symmetry compared to the Floor and the Symmetry methods.
For coarse-graining in time, where data points are averaged in non-overlapping
time windows, we find that the scaling for both anti-correlated and positively
correlated signals is practically preserved. The results of our simulations are
useful for the correct interpretation of the correlation and scaling properties
of symbolic sequences.

band from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) arises from multiple shocks internal to the
ultra-relativistic expansion. The detailed understanding of the dissipation and
accompanying acceleration at these shocks is a currently topical subject. This
paper explores the relationship between GRB prompt emission spectra and the
electron (or ion) acceleration properties at the relativistic shocks that
pertain to GRB models. The focus is on the array of possible high-energy
power-law indices in accelerated populations, highlighting how spectra above 1
MeV can probe the field obliquity in GRB internal shocks, and the character of
hydromagnetic turbulence in their environs. It is emphasized that diffusive
shock acceleration theory generates no canonical spectrum at relativistic MHD
discontinuities. This diversity is commensurate with the significant range of
spectral indices discerned in prompt burst emission. Such system diagnostics
are now being enhanced by the broadband spectral coverage of bursts by the
Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope; while the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
provides key diagnostics on the lower energy portions of the particle
population, the focus here is on constraints in the non-thermal, power-law
regime of the particle distribution that are provided by the Large Area
Telescope (LAT).

minimal-associated reconstruction operators for Schauder frames. We prove that
a Schauder frame is a near-Schauder basis if and only if the kernel of the

necessary and sufficient condition when the Lommel function has finitely many

polynomial/rational-type functions which are of independent interest. In

systems. Of particular interests, these two laws often appear together. Many
theoretical models and analyses are performed to understand their co-occurrence
in real systems, but it still lacks a clear picture about their relation.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We show that the Heaps' law can be considered
as a derivative phenomenon if the system obeys the Zipf's law. Furthermore, we
refine the known approximate solution of the Heaps' exponent provided the
Zipf's exponent. We show that the approximate solution is indeed an asymptotic
solution for infinite systems, while in the finite-size system the Heaps'
exponent is sensitive to the system size. Extensive empirical analysis on tens
of disparate systems demonstrates that our refined results can better capture
the relation between the Zipf's and Heaps' exponents. Conclusions/Significance:
The present analysis provides a clear picture about the relation between the
Zipf's law and Heaps' law without the help of any specific stochastic model,
namely the Heaps' law is indeed a derivative phenomenon from Zipf's law. The
presented numerical method gives considerably better estimation of the Heaps'
exponent given the Zipf's exponent and the system size. Our analysis provides
some insights and implications of real complex systems, for example, one can
naturally obtained a better explanation of the accelerated growth of scale-free
networks.

sphere of initial density rho\propto r^{-omega} approach a self-similar (SLS)
behavior, with velocity \dot{R}\propto R^delta, as R->\infty. For omega>3 the
solutions are of the second-type, i.e., delta is determined by the requirement
that the flow should include a sonic point. No solution satisfying this
requirement exists, however, in the 3\leq omega\leq omega_{g}(gamma) ``gap''
(\omega_{g}=3.26 for adiabatic index gamma=5/3). We argue that second-type
solutions should not be required in general to include a sonic point. Rather,
it is sufficient to require the existence of a characteristic line r_c(t), such
that the energy in the region r_c(t)<r<R approaches a constant as R->\infty,
and an asymptotic solution given by the SLS solution at r_c(t)<r<R and
deviating from it at r<r_c may be constructed. The two requirements coincide
for omega>omega_g and the latter identifies delta=0 solutions as the asymptotic
solutions for 3\leq omega\leq omega_{g} (as suggested by Gruzinov03). In these
solutions, r_c is a C_0 characteristic. It is difficult to check, using
numerical solutions of the hydrodynamic equations, whether the flow indeed
approaches a delta=0 SLS behavior as R->\infty, due to the slow convergence to
SLS for omega~3. We show that in this case the flow may be described by a
modified SLS solution, d\ln\dot{R}/d\ln R=delta with slowly varying delta(R),
eta\equiv d delta/d\ln R<<1, and spatial profiles given by a sum of the SLS
solution corresponding to the instantaneous value of delta and a SLS correction
linear in eta. The modified SLS solutions provide an excellent approximation to
numerical solutions obtained for omega~3 at large R, with delta->0 (and

dimensional flows of an ideal gas approach self-similar behavior when the
characteristic length scale over which the flow takes place, $R$, diverges or
tends to zero. It is commonly assumed that self-similarity is approached since
in the $R\to\infty(0)$ limit the flow becomes independent of any characteristic
length or time scales. In this case the flow fields $f(r,t)$ must be of the
form $f(r,t)=t^{\alpha_f}F(r/R)$ with $R\propto(\pm t)^\alpha$. We show that
requiring the asymptotic flow to be independent only of characteristic length
scales imply a more general form of self-similar solutions,
$f(r,t)=R^{\delta_f}F(r/R)$ with $\dot{R}\propto R^\delta$, which includes the
exponential ($\delta=1$) solutions, $R\propto e^{t/\tau}$. We demonstrate that
the latter, less restrictive, requirement is the physically relevant one by
showing that the asymptotic behavior of accelerating blast-waves, driven by the
release of energy at the center of a cold gas sphere of initial density
$\rho\propto r^{-\omega}$, changes its character at large $\omega$: The flow is
described by $0\le\delta<1$, $R\propto t^{1/(1-\delta)}$, solutions for
$\omega<\omega_c$, by $\delta>1$ solutions with $R\propto (-t)^{1/(\delta-1)}$
diverging at finite time ($t=0$) for $\omega>\omega_c$, and by exponential
solutions for $\omega=\omega_c$ ($\omega_c$ depends on the adiabatic index of
the gas, $\omega_c\sim8$ for $4/3<\gamma<5/3$). The properties of the new
solutions obtained here for $\omega\ge\omega_c$ are analyzed, and self-similar
solutions describing the $t>0$ behavior for $\omega>\omega_c$ are also derived.

particle track in a dielectric medium is derived from first principles. An
algorithm is developed to obtain the pulse in the time domain for numerical
calculations. The algorithm is implemented in a Monte Carlo simulation of
electromagnetic showers in dense media (specifically designed for coherent
radio emission applications) as might be induced by interactions of ultra-high
energy neutrinos. The coherent Cherenkov radio emission produced by such
showers is obtained simultaneously both in the time and frequency domains. A
consistency check performed by Fourier-transforming the pulse in time and
comparing it to the frequency spectrum obtained directly in the simulations
yields, as expected, fully consistent results. The reversal of the time
structure inside the Cherenkov cone and the signs of the corresponding pulses
are addressed in detail. The results, besides testing algorithms used for
reference calculations in the frequency domain, shed new light into the
properties of the radio pulse in the time domain. The shape of the pulse in the
time domain is directly related to the depth development of the excess charge
in the shower and its width to the observation angle with respect to the
Cherenkov direction. This information can be of great practical importance for
interpreting actual data.

structure of the electron as a system of regularly spaced concentric shells of
elasticity. I started from the experiment on the diffraction of electrons and
EMWs at the sharp edge of the opaque half-plane. This simple scattering
configuration enabled me to discriminate between the re-radiation mechanism of
the wave diffraction and ricochet scattering of electrons on the edge of the
half-plane. Then I made experiments with scattering on composite objects
proceeding step by step from a single straight edge to a couple of edges (one
slit) and then to four edges (two slits). Thus I succeeded in interpretation of
the double-slit diffraction (four straight edges) in terms of the scattering on
a single edge. I managed also to observe the electron's trajectory. Equipping
the slit's edge with a semiconductor sensors I registered the passing of the
electron through the slit detecting simultaneously a weaker signal at another
slit. This technique appeared not to destroy or disturb the ""interference""
pattern. Closing one slit by inserting therein a transparent for EMWs piece of
dielectric I have found that the scattering pattern beneath this slit vanishes
while the scattering pattern under the open slit remains as before when both
slits were open. This experiment indicates that the electron ""interferes"" with

pattern is observed due to the fact that excitation of the antibonding mode is
forbidden for symmetric excitation at the feedgap, while concomitantly the mode

Modeling shows that the jet must be inclined and that the gamma ray emitting

that the electrons gain energy where the jet is recollimated by the stellar
wind pressure and forms a shock. Jet precession should strongly affect the

that randomness offers no benefit--the optimal mechanism is always

operator on a complete stable minimal hypersurface $M$ in the hyperbolic space
which has finite $L^2$-norm of the second fundamental form on $M$. We provide
some sufficient conditions for minimal hypersurface of the hyperbolic space to
be stable. We also describe stability of catenoids and helicoids in the
hyperbolic space. In particular, it is shown that there exists a family of
stable higher-dimensional catenoids in the hyperbolic space.

system at a relatively low Rayleigh number, i.e. $Ra = 4\times10^7$, is studied
for different Pr by direct numerical simulations and the results are compared
with laminar BL theory. In this regime we find a smooth onset of the heat
transfer enhancement as function of increasing rotation rate. We study this
regime in detail and introduce a model based on the Grossmann-Lohse theory to
describe the heat transfer enhancement as function of the rotation rate for
this relatively low Ra number regime and weak background rotation $Ro\gtrsim
1$. The smooth onset of heat transfer enhancement observed here is in contrast
to the sharp onset observed at larger $Ra \gtrsim 10^8$ by Stevens {\it{et
al.}} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf{103}}, 024503, 2009], although only a small shift
in the Ra-Ro-Pr phase space is involved.

explicit expression of the entropy is obtained, wherewith we estimated the
largest period. The numerical simulation of the entropy of the entangled atomic
and cavity systems shows that its time evolution presents multi-periodicity.
The effects of detuning parameter on the period and the amplitude of the

in the presence of external magnetic field that is an analog of a uniform
magnetic field in the flat space. Generalized Landau levels have been found,
modified by the presence of the space curvature. In Lobachevsky4-model the
energy spectrum contains discrete and continuous parts, the number of bound
states is finite; in Riemann 4-model all energy spectrum is discrete.
Generalized Landau levels are determined by three parameters, the magnitude of
the magnetic field $B$, the curvature radius $\rho$ and the magnetic quantum
number $m$. It has been shown that in presence of an additional external
electric field the energy spectrum in the Riemann model can be also obtained
analytically.

review important distinctions such as the dimensionless and dimensional
physical constants, and the classification of constants proposed by
Levy-Leblond. Then we explore how two great analogies, computational and
biological, can give new insights into our problem. This paper includes a
preliminary study to examine the two analogies. Importantly, analogies are both
useful and fundamental cognitive tools, but can also be misused or
misinterpreted. The idea that our universe might be modelled as a computational
entity is analysed, and we discuss the distinction between physical laws and
initial conditions using algorithmic information theory. Smolin introduced the
theory of ""Cosmological Natural Selection"" with a biological analogy in mind.
We examine an extension of this analogy involving intelligent life. We discuss
