scalar perturbations produced during inflation driven by a canonically
normalized scalar field whose potential exhibits small sinusoidal modulations.
A potential of this type has been derived in a class of string theory models of
inflation based on axion monodromy. We use this model as a concrete example,
but we present our derivations and results for a general slow-roll potential
with superimposed modulations. We show analytically that a resonance between
the oscillations of the background and the oscillations of the fluctuations is
responsible for the production of an observably large non-Gaussian signal. We
provide an explicit expression for the shape of this resonant non-Gaussianity.
We show that there is essentially no overlap between this shape and the local,
equilateral, and orthogonal shapes, and we stress that resonant non-Gaussianity
is not captured by the simplest version of the effective field theory of
inflation. We hope our analytic expression will be useful to further
observationally constrain this class of models.

corresponding planetary radiation balance we state that (a) the this globally
averaged energy balance model is flawed by unsuitable physical considerations,
(b) the planetary radiation balance for an Earth in the absence of an
atmosphere is fraught by the inappropriate assumption of a uniform surface
temperature, the so-called radiative equilibrium temperature of about 255 K,
and (c) the effect of the radiative anthropogenic forcing, considered as a
perturbation to the natural system, is much smaller than the uncertainty
involved in the solution of the model of Schneider and Mass. This uncertainty
is mainly related to the empirical constants suggested by various authors and
used for predicting the emission of infrared radiation by the Earth's skin.
Furthermore, after inserting the absorption of solar radiation by atmospheric
constituents and the exchange of sensible and latent heat between the Earth and
the atmosphere into the model of Schneider and Mass the surface temperatures
become appreciably lesser than the radiative equilibrium temperature. Moreover,
neither the model of Schneider and Mass nor the Dines-type two-layer energy
balance model for the Earth-atmosphere system, both contain the planetary
radiation balance for an Earth in the absence of an atmosphere as an asymptotic
solution, do not provide evidence for the existence of the so-called
atmospheric greenhouse effect if realistic empirical data are used.

are the BTZ black hole and the warped AdS black hole. For the non-rotating BTZ
black hole, the area and entropy spectra are equally spaced and independent of
the coupling constant $\v$ of the Chern-Simons term. For the rotating BTZ black
hole case, the spectra of the inner and outer horizon areas are not equally
spaced in general and dependent of the coupling constant $\v$. However the
entropy spectrum is equally spaced and independent of the coupling constant
$\v$. For the warped AdS black holes for $\v >1$ by using the quasinormal modes
obtained without imposing the boundary condition at radial infinity we find
again that the entropy spectrum is equally spaced and independent of the
coupling constant $\v$, while the spectra of the inner and outer horizon areas
are not equally spaced and dependent of the coupling constant $\v$. Our result
implies that the entropy spectrum has a universal behavior regardless of the
presence of the gravitational Chern-Simons term, and therefore it implies that
the entropy is more `fundamental' than the horizon area.

tunneling microscopy to visualize electronic states in Ga1-xMnxAs samples close
to this transition. Our measurements show that doping-induced disorder produces
strong spatial variations in the local tunneling conductance across a wide
range of energies. Near the Fermi energy, where spectroscopic signatures of
electron-electron interaction are the most prominent, the electronic states
exhibit a diverging spatial correlation length. Power-law decay of the spatial
correlations is accompanied by log-normal distributions of the local density of
states and multifractal spatial characteristics. Our method can be used to
explore critical correlations in other materials close to a quantum critical
point.

Structural stability is reviewed and applied to perturbations of the linearized
Vlasov operator through perturbations of f_0. We prove that for each f_0 there
is an arbitrarily small delta f_0' in W^{1,1}(R) such that f_0+delta f_0$ is
unstable. When $f_0$ is perturbed by an area preserving rearrangement, f_0 will
always be stable if the continuous spectrum is only of positive signature,
where the signature of the continuous spectrum is defined as in previous work.
If there is a signature change, then there is a rearrangement of f_0 that is
unstable and arbitrarily close to f_0 with f_0' in W^{1,1}. This result is
analogous to Krein's theorem for the continuous spectrum. We prove that if a
discrete mode embedded in the continuous spectrum is surrounded by the opposite
signature there is an infinitesimal perturbation in C^n norm that makes f_0
unstable. If f_0 is stable we prove that the signature of every discrete mode
is the opposite of the continuum surrounding it.

prolific in type-I X-ray bursts, and we investigate them in the context of
complete outbursts evolution. A total exposure of ~ 309 ks was collected by
RXTE during the two outbursts of IGR J17473-2721. We carried out a systematic
search for type-I bursts in this data set. For each burst found, we
investigated the burst profile, the peak flux, and their dependence on the
accretion rate along the evolution of the outbursts. Eighteen type-I X-ray
bursts were found from IGR J17473-2721: two from the outburst in 2005 and the
other 16 from the recent outburst in 2008. Among them, 3 bursts show
photospheric radius expansion (PRE). The distance to the source is estimated as
6.4 kpc with a 15% uncertainty based on the three bursts that show PRE. In the
recent outburst, there are 6 bursts showing up in the low/hard state prior to
the state transition to a high/soft state, 3 bursts at the end phase of the
high/soft state, and 7 in the following low/hard state. The blackbody radius of
these bursts presents a variety of interesting features. We find that at the
end of the recent outburst, the profile of the blackbody radius is
anti-correlated with the blackbody temperature and the burst flux. The
durations of the type-I burst are found to correlate with the Eddington ratio
and to have two parallel evolution groups. Along the decreasing Eddington
ratio, the burst duration decreases and ends in each group the PRE bursts
occurred. This provides new clues to the type-I bursts in the context of
outbursts for atoll XRBs.

The directed net electric current is generated in single layer graphene by
circularly polarized terahertz laser radiation at normal as well as at oblique
incidence and changes its sign upon reversing the radiation helicity. The
phenomenological and microscopic theories of the observed photocurrents are
developed. We demonstrate that under oblique incidence the current is caused by
the circular photon drag effect in the interior of graphene sheet. By contrast,
the effect at normal incidence stems from the sample edges, which reduce the
symmetry and result in an asymmetric scattering of carriers driven by the
radiation field. Besides a photon helicity dependent current we also observe
photocurrents in response to linearly polarized radiation. The microscopic
mechanisms governing this effect are discussed.

allowing some form of switching when, depending on their initial conditions,
solutions of the dynamical system end up in different regions of state space
(associated with different biochemical functions). Switching is often realized
by a bistable system (i.e. a dynamical system allowing two stable steady state
solutions) and, in the majority of cases, bistability is established
numerically. In our point of view this approach is too restrictive, as, one the
one hand, due to predominant parameter uncertainty numerical methods are
generally difficult to apply to realistic models originating in Systems
Biology. And on the other hand switching already arises with the occurrence of
a saddle type steady state (characterized by a Jacobian where exactly one
Eigenvalue is positive and the remaining eigenvalues have negative real part).
Consequently we derive conditions based on linear inequalities that allow the
analytic computation of states and parameters where the Jacobian derived from a
mass action network has a defective zero eigenvalue so that -- under certain
genericity conditions -- a saddle-node bifurcation occurs. Our conditions are
applicable to general mass action networks involving at least one conservation
relation, however, they are only sufficient (as infeasibility of linear
inequalities does not exclude defective zero eigenvalues).

drawn out by rising radio bubbles. In both regions bimodal distributions of
colour (B-R)_0 against magnitude are apparent, suggesting two populations of
star clusters with different ages; most of the H alpha filaments show no
detectable star formation. The younger, bluer population is found to be
concentrated along the filaments while the older population is dispersed evenly
about the galaxy. We construct colour-magnitude diagrams and derive ages of at

that a formation mechanism or event different to that for the young inner

determine the join irreducibles of the cross section lattice. Exploiting this
we find characterizations of the relatively complemented intervals. By a result

an interval of the cross section lattice is Boolean if and only if it is
relatively complemented if and only if it is atomic. We characterize
distributive cross section lattices, showing that they are products of chains.

of the unmixing algorithms proposed in the literature do not take into account
the possible spatial correlations between the pixels. In this work, a Bayesian
model is introduced to exploit these correlations. The image to be unmixed is
assumed to be partitioned into regions (or classes) where the statistical
properties of the abundance coefficients are homogeneous. A Markov random field
is then proposed to model the spatial dependency of the pixels within any
class. Conditionally upon a given class, each pixel is modeled by using the
classical linear mixing model with additive white Gaussian noise. This strategy
is investigated the well known linear mixing model. For this model, the
posterior distributions of the unknown parameters and hyperparameters allow
ones to infer the parameters of interest. These parameters include the
abundances for each pixel, the means and variances of the abundances for each
class, as well as a classification map indicating the classes of all pixels in
the image. To overcome the complexity of the posterior distribution of
interest, we consider Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that generate samples
distributed according to the posterior of interest. The generated samples are
then used for parameter and hyperparameter estimation. The accuracy of the
proposed algorithms is illustrated on synthetic and real data.

many purposes such as the fair distribution of grants based on the scientist's
publication output, concession of research projects, classification of journal
editorial boards and many other applications in a social context. In this
paper, we propose a method for measuring the performance of groups of
researchers. The proposed method is called alpha-index and it is based on two
parameters: (i) the homogeneity of the h-indexes of the researchers in the
group; and (ii) the h-group, which is an extension of the h-index for groups.
Our method integrates the concepts of homogeneity and absolute value of the
h-index into a single measure which is appropriate for the evaluation of
groups. We report on experiments that assess computer science conferences based
on the h-indexes of their program committee members. Our results are similar to
a manual classification scheme adopted by a research agency.

Poincare-Lefschetz duality. Given an n-dimensional manifold W, a topological
arbiter associates a value 0 or 1 to codimension zero submanifolds of W,
subject to natural topological and duality axioms. For example, there is a
unique arbiter on $RP^2$, which reports the location of the essential 1-cycle.
In contrast, we show that there exists an uncountable collection of topological
arbiters in dimension 4. Families of arbiters, not induced by homology, are
also shown to exist in higher dimensions. The technical ingredients underlying
the four dimensional results are secondary obstructions to generalized
link-slicing problems. For classical links in the 3-sphere the construction
relies on the existence of nilpotent embedding obstructions in dimension 4,
reflected in particular by the Milnor group. In higher dimensions novel
arbiters are produced using nontrivial squares in stable homotopy theory.
  The concept of ""topological arbiter"" derives from percolation and from
4-dimensional surgery. It is not the purpose of this paper to advance either of
these subjects, but rather to study the concept for its own sake. However in
appendices we give both an application to percolation, and the current
understanding of the relationship between arbiters and surgery. An appendix
also introduces a more general notion of a multi-arbiter. Properties and
applications are discussed, including a construction of non-homological
multi-arbiters.

modes and molecular structures. In Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)
spectroscopy, a molecular vibrational spectrum is resolved via the third-order
nonlinear interaction of pump, Stokes and probe photons, typically using a
complex experimental setup with multiple beams and laser sources. Although CARS
has become a widespread technique for label-free chemical imaging and detection
of contaminants, its multi-source, multi-beam experimental implementation is
challenging. In this work we present a simple and easily implementable scheme
for performing single-beam CARS spectroscopy and microscopy using a single
femtosecond pulse, shaped by a tunable narrowband notch filter. As a substitute
for multiple sources, the single broadband pulse simultaneously provides the
pump, Stokes and probe photons, exciting a broad band of vibrational levels.
High spectroscopic resolution is obtained by utilizing a tunable spectral
notch, shaped with a resonant photonic crystal slab filter, as a narrowband,
time-delayed probe. Using this scheme the entire vibrational spectrum can be
resolved in a single-shot multiplexed measurement, circumventing the need for a
multi-source configuration or a complex pulse-shaping apparatus. We demonstrate
high-resolution single-beam micro-spectroscopy and vibrational imaging of
various samples in the 300cm^{-1}-1000cm^{-1} spectral range.

To identify and characterize bars, we use ellipse-fitting. We use visual
classification, a Sersic cut, and a color cut to select disk galaxies, and find
that the latter two methods miss 31% and 51%, respectively of disk galaxies
identified through visual classification. This underscores the importance of
carefully selecting the disk sample in cluster environments. However, we find
that the global optical bar fraction in the clusters is ~30% regardless of the
method of disk selection. We study the relationship of the optical bar fraction
to host galaxy properties, and find that the optical bar fraction depends
strongly on the luminosity of the galaxy and whether it hosts a prominent bulge
or is bulgeless. Within a given absolute magnitude bin, the optical bar
fraction increases for galaxies with no significant bulge component. Within
each morphological type bin, the optical bar fraction increases for brighter
galaxies. We find no strong trend (variations larger than a factor of 1.3) for
the optical bar fraction with local density within the cluster between the core

resembles the evolution of Potts spin-glass with external global field
corresponding to a panic effect in the economy. The existence of a global phase
transition, between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, explains the large
susceptibility of the system to negative shocks. We show that bailing out the
first few defaulting firms does not solve the problem, but does have the effect
of alleviating considerably the global shock, as measured by the fraction of
firms that are not defaulting as a consequence. This beneficial effect is the
counterpart of the large vulnerability of the system of coupled firms, which
are both the direct consequences of the collective self-organized endogenous
behaviors of the credit ratings of the firms in our economic network.

report the discovery of a faint stellar companion to the A3V star zeta
Virginis. This companion is ~7 magnitudes fainter than its host star in the
H-band, and infrared imaging spanning 4.75 years over five epochs indicates
this companion has common proper motion with its host star. Using evolutionary
models, we estimate its mass to be 0.168+/-.016 solar masses, giving a mass
ratio for this system q = 0.082. Assuming the two objects are coeval, this mass
suggests a M4V-M7V spectral type for the companion, which is confirmed through
integral field spectroscopic measurements. We see clear evidence for orbital
motion from this companion and are able to constrain the semi-major axis to be
greater than 24.9 AU, the period > 124$ yrs, and eccentricity > 0.16.
Multiplicity studies of higher mass stars are relatively rare, and binary
companions such as this one at the extreme low end of the mass ratio
distribution are useful additions to surveys incomplete at such a low mass
ratio. Moreover, the frequency of binary companions can help to discriminate
between binary formation scenarios that predict an abundance of low-mass
companions forming from the early fragmentation of a massive circumstellar
disk. A system such as this may provide insight into the anomalous X-ray
emission from A stars, hypothesized to be from unseen late-type stellar
companions. Indeed, we calculate that the presence of this M-dwarf companion
easily accounts for the X-ray emission from this star detected by ROSAT.

measurements of neutral pion trigger particles at transverse momenta p^t_T =

First, the relative angular distribution of low momentum hadrons, whose shape
modification has been interpreted as a medium response to parton energy loss,
is found to be modified only for p^t_T < 7 GeV/c. At higher p^t_T, the data are
consistent with unmodified or very weakly modified shapes, even for the lowest
measured p^a_T. This observation presents a quantitative challenge to medium
response scenarios. Second, the associated yield of hadrons opposite to the
trigger particle in Au+Au relative to that in p+p (I_AA) is found to be
suppressed at large momentum (IAA ~ 0.35-0.5), but less than the single
particle nuclear modification factor (R_AA ~0.2).

self-similarity is critical to a proper determination of M, which differs from
the conventional Planck mass by roughly 19 orders of magnitude. This
exceedingly simple and generic mass equation retrodicts the masses of a
representative set of 27 well-known particles with an average relative error of
1.6%. A more rigorous mass formula, which includes the total spin angular

to much smaller radii is one of the oustanding problems in our understanding of
the formation and evolution of super-massive black holes (BHs). Seemingly
unrelated observations have discovered that there is a lopsided stellar disk of
unknown origin orbiting the BH in M31, and possibly many other systems. We show
that these nominally independent puzzles are in fact closely related.
Multi-scale simulations of gas inflow from galactic to BH scales show that when
sufficient gas is driven towards a BH, gravitational instabilities form a
lopsided, eccentric disk that propagates inwards from larger radii. The
lopsided stellar disk exerts a strong torque on the remaining gas, driving
inflows that fuel the growth of the BH and produce quasar-level luminosities.
The same disk can produce significant obscuration along many sightlines and
thus may be the putative 'torus' invoked to explain obscured active galactic
nuclei and the cosmic X-ray background. The stellar relic of this disk is long
lived and retains the eccentric pattern. Simulations that yield quasar-level
accretion rates produce relic stellar disks with kinematics, eccentric
patterns, precession rates, and surface density profiles in reasonable
agreement with observations of M31. The observed properties of nuclear stellar
disks can thus be used to constrain the formation history of super-massive BHs.

near the well-studied cluster MS0451-0305. Using multicolour Subaru/Suprime-Cam
and CFHT/Megaprime imaging together with Keck spectroscopy we identify member
galaxies. A VLT/FORS2 spectrum was taken to determine the redshifts of the
brightest elliptical and the lensed arc. Using HST/ACS images we determine the
group's weak lensing signal and model the strong lens system. This is the first
time that a fossil group is analysed with lensing methods. The X-ray luminosity
and temperature are derived from XMM-Newton data.
  We find two filaments extending over 4 Mpc, and within the virial radius we
identify 31 members spectroscopically and 33 via the red sequence with i<22
mag. They segregate into spirals and a dynamically cooler central concentration
of ellipticals with a velocity dispersion of 480 km/s. Weak lensing and cluster
richness relations yield r200 = 830 kpc and M200 = 0.85 x 10^14 Msun. The
brightest group galaxy (BGG) is inconsistent with the dynamic centre of J0454.
It strongly lenses a galaxy at z~2.1, and we model the lens with a
pseudo-isothermal elliptical mass distribution. A large external shear requires
that the BGG must be offset from J0454's dark halo centre by at least 90-130
kpc. The X-ray halo is offset by 24 kpc from the BGG, shows no signs of a
cooling flow and is well described by a beta-model. With L = 1.4 x 10^43 erg/s
J0454 falls well onto standard X-ray cluster scaling relations, but appears
cooler (1.1 keV) than expected (2 keV). We conclude that J0454 consists of two
systems, a sparse cluster and an infalling fossil group, the latter seeding the
BCG. An alternative explanation is that galaxies in a filament, projected along
the line of sight, stream towards the denser fossil group.

sector which generates a non-perturbative superpotential leading to
supersymmetry breaking and moduli stabilization. We demonstrate this effect in
a simple model which contains many of the features of the more general

black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries, which are thought to be the sources
of short hard gamma ray bursts (SHBs). The gamma ray fireballs seem to be
beamed into a small solid angle and therefore only a fraction of detectable GW
events is expected to be observationally coincident with SHBs. Similarly
ultrahigh energy (UHE) neutrino signals associated with gamma ray bursts (GRBs)
could fail to be corroborated by prompt gamma-ray emission if the latter is
beamed in a narrower cone than the neutrinos. Alternative ways to corroborate
non-electromagnetic signals from coalescing neutron stars are therefore all the
more desirable. It is noted here that the extended X-ray tails (XRT) of SHBs
are similar to X-ray flashes (XRFs), and that both can be attributed to an
off-axis line of sight and thus span a larger solid angle than the hard
emission. It is proposed that a higher fraction of detectable GW events may be
coincident with XRF/XRT than with hard gamma-rays, thereby enhancing the
possibility to detect it as a GW or neutrino source. Scattered gamma-rays,
which may subtend a much larger solid angle that the primary gamma ray jet, are
also candidates for corroborating non-electromagnetic signals.

J0728+3835 at z = 0.206. The analysis is based on two-dimensional kinematic
maps extending out to 1.7 effective radii obtained from Keck spectroscopy, on
lensing geometry and on stellar mass estimates obtained from multiband Hubble
Space Telescope imaging. The data are modelled under the assumptions of axial
symmetry supported by a two-integral distribution function (DF), by applying
the combined gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics code CAULDRON, and
yielding high-quality constraints for an early-type galaxy at cosmological
redshifts. Modelling the total density profile as a power-law of the form
rho_tot ~ 1/r^{gamma}, we find that it is nearly isothermal (logarithmic slope
gamma = 2.08^{+0.04}_{-0.02}), and quite flattened (axial ratio q =
0.60^{+0.08}_{-0.03}). The galaxy is mildly anisotropic (delta = 0.08 +/- 0.02)
and shows a fair amount of rotational support, in particular towards the outer
regions. We determine a dark matter fraction lower limit of 28 per cent within
the effective radius. The stellar contribution to the total mass distribution
is close to maximal for a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), whereas for a
Salpeter IMF the stellar mass exceeds the total mass within the galaxy inner
regions. We find that the combination of a NFW dark matter halo with the
maximally rescaled luminous profile provides a remarkably good fit to the total
mass distribution over a broad radial range. Our results confirm and expand the
findings of the SLACS survey for early-type galaxies of comparable velocity
dispersion (sigma_SDSS = 214 +/- 11 km/s). The internal structure of J0728 is
consistent with that of local early-type galaxies of comparable velocity
dispersion as measured by the SAURON project, suggesting lack of evolution in
the past two billion years.

integer $d\ge3$, there are only finitely many $d$-regular graphs whose second
largest eigenvalue is at most $2\sqrt{d-1}-\epsilon$. Serre gave a
strengthening showing that a positive proportion of eigenvalues of any
$d$-regular graph must be bigger than $2\sqrt{d-1}-\epsilon$. We provide a
multipartite version of this result. Our proofs are elementary and work also in
the case when graphs are not regular. In the simplest, monopartite case, our
result extends the Alon-Boppana-Serre result to non-regular graphs of minimum
degree $d$ and bounded maximum degree. The two-partite result shows that for
every $\epsilon>0$ and any positive integers $d_1,d_2,d$, every $n$-vertex
graph of maximum degree at most $d$, whose vertex set is the union of (not
necessarily disjoint) subsets $V_1,V_2$, such that every vertex in $V_i$ has at
least $d_i$ neighbors in $V_{3-i}$ for $i=1,2$, has $\Omega_\epsilon(n)$
eigenvalues that are larger than $\sqrt{d_1-1}+\sqrt{d_2-1}-\epsilon$. Finally,
we strengthen the Alon-Boppana-Serre theorem by showing that the lower bound
$2\sqrt{d-1}-\epsilon$ can be replaced by $2\sqrt{d-1} + \delta$ for some
$\delta>0$ if graphs have bounded ""global girth"". On the other side of the
spectrum, if the odd girth is large, then we get an Alon-Boppana-Serre type
theorem for the negative eigenvalues as well.

earlier, the effects of nebular lines significantly affect the age

dust attenuation in some of the z ~6-8 galaxies, which have best-fit values of

attenuation with galaxy mass, and a relatively large scatter in specific
star-formation rates, SFR/M*. The physical parameters of very high-z galaxies

blurred by high mutation rates and/or horizontal transfer events. As a
consequence a divergence arises between the true evolutionary distances and the
differences between pairs of taxa as inferred from available data, making the
phylogenetic reconstruction a challenging problem. Mathematically this
divergence translates in a loss of additivity of the actual distances between
taxa. In distance-based reconstruction methods, two properties of additive
distances were extensively exploited as antagonist criteria to drive phylogeny
reconstruction: on the one hand a local property of quartets, i.e., sets of
four taxa in a tree, the four-points condition; on the other hand a recently
proposed formula that allows to write the tree length as a function of the
distances between taxa, the Pauplin's formula. Here we introduce a new
reconstruction scheme, that exploits in a unified framework both the
four-points condition and the Pauplin's formula. We propose, in particular, a
new general class of distance-based Stochastic Local Search algorithms, which
reduces in a limit case to the minimization of the Pauplin's length. When
tested on artificially generated phylogenies our Stochastic Big-Quartet
Swapping algorithmic scheme significantly outperforms state-of-art
distance-based algorithms in cases of deviation from additivity due to high
rate of back mutations. A significant improvement is also observed with respect
to the state-of-art algorithms in case of high rate of horizontal transfer.

metallicity indicator for individual stars as well as integrated light of
Galactic globular clusters (GCs) and galaxies with varying degrees of success,
and sometimes puzzling results. Using the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph on
Keck we obtain a sample of 144 integrated light spectra of GCs around the
brightest group galaxy NGC 1407 to test whether the CaT index can be used as a
metallicity indicator for extragalactic GCs. Different sets of single stellar
population models make different predictions for the behavior of the CaT as a
function of metallicity. In this work, the metallicities of the GCs around NGC
1407 are obtained from CaT index values using an empirical conversion. The
measured CaT/metallicity distributions show unexpected features, the most
remarkable being that the brightest red and blue GCs have similar CaT values
despite their large difference in mean color. Suggested explanations for this
behavior in the NGC 1407 GC system are: 1) the CaT may be affected by a
population of hot blue stars, 2) the CaT may saturate earlier than predicted by
the models, and/or 3) color may not trace metallicity linearly. Until these
possibilities are understood, the use of the CaT as a metallicity indicator for
the integrated spectra of extragalactic GCs will remain problematic.

bent lateral (outer) tails. Here we report on a deeper (78 ks) Chandra
observation and a few additional XMM-Newton observations of the Geminga PWN.
The new Chandra observation has shown that the axial tail, which includes up to
three brighter blobs, extends at least 50"" (i.e., 0.06 d_{250} pc) from the
pulsar. It also allowed us to image the patchy outer tails and the emission in
the immediate vicinity of the pulsar with high resolution. The PWN luminosity,
L_{0.3-8 keV} ~ 3\times 10^{29} d_{250}^2 erg/s, is lower than the pulsar's
magnetospheric luminosity by a factor of 10. The spectra of the PWN elements
are rather hard (photon index ~ 1). Comparing the two Chandra images, we found
evidence of PWN variability, including possible motion of the blobs along the
axial tail. The X-ray PWN is the synchrotron radiation from relativistic
particles of the pulsar wind; its morphology is connected with the supersonic
motion of Geminga. We speculate that the outer tails are either (1) a sky
projection of the limb-brightened boundary of a shell formed in the region of
contact discontinuity, where the wind bulk flow is decelerated by shear
instability, or (2) polar outflows from the pulsar bent by the ram pressure
from the ISM. In the former case, the axial tail may be a jet emanating along
the pulsar's spin axis, perhaps aligned with the direction of motion. In the
latter case, the axial tail may be the shocked pulsar wind collimated by the
ram pressure.

distributions (SEDs) to the star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei,
using Spitzer 24, 70 and 160 micron and SCUBA 850 micron survey results as the

  Star-forming galaxies dominate the source counts, and a model in which their
far-infrared-radio correlation and infrared SED assignment procedure are
invariant with redshift underpredicts the observed 24 and 70 micron source
counts. The 70 micron deficit can be eliminated if the star-forming galaxies
undergo stronger luminosity evolution than originally assumed for the radio
simulation, a requirement which may be partially ascribed to known
non-linearity in the far-infrared--radio correlation at low luminosity if it
evolves with redshift. At 24 micron, the shortfall is reduced if the
star-forming galaxies develop SEDs with cooler dust and correspondingly
stronger Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features with
increasing redshift at a given far-infrared luminosity, but this trend may
reverse at z>1 in order not to overproduce the sub-mm source counts. The
resulting model compares favourably with recent BLAST results and we have
extended the simulation database to aid the interpretation of Herschel surveys.
Such comparisons may also facilitate further model refinement and revised

more challenging. Detecting the shape of a geophysical object underneath the
earth surface from gravity anomaly is one of such complex problems, where the

difficulties of non-uniqueness, ill-conditioning and nonlinearity, a
statistical Bayesian model inference approach is adopted. A reversible jump
Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm is proposed to overcome the
difficulty of trans-dimensionality. Carefully designed within-model and
between-model Markov chain moves are implemented to reduce the rate of
generating inadmissible geometries, thus achieving good overall efficiency in
the Monte Carlo sampler. Numerical experiments on a 2-D problem show that the
proposed algorithm is capable of obtaining satisfactory solutions with
quantifiable uncertainty to a challenging trans-dimensional geophysical inverse
problem. Solutions from RJMCMC appear to be parsimonious for the given prior,
in the sense that among the models satisfactorily represent the true model,
models with higher posterior probabilities tend to have fewer number of
parameters. The proposed numerical algorithm can be readily adapted to other
similar trans-dimensional geophysical inverse applications.

of the results for O(m) and G, the orthogonality of the Hermite polynomials

consequence, an extension of the Mehler formula for the classical Hermite
polynomials to Grassmann algebras is proven. Next, Hermite polynomials in a
full superspace with O(m) x Sp(2n) symmetry are considered. It is shown that
they are not orthogonal with respect to the canonically defined inner product.
However, a new inner product is introduced which behaves correctly with respect
to the structure of harmonic polynomials on superspace. This inner product
allows to restore the orthogonality of the Hermite polynomials and also
restores the hermiticity of a class of Schroedinger operators in superspace.
Subsequently, a Mehler formula for the full superspace is obtained, thus
yielding an eigenfunction decomposition of the super Fourier transform.
Finally, an extensive comparison is made of the results in the different types

demonstrated to be crucial in nanorod growth, which increases proportional to
one fifth power of the ratio of the interlayer hopping rate of adatoms across
the monolayer steps to the deposition rate. When the radius of the initial
island is larger than this characteristic radius, the growth morphology evolves
from a taper-like structure to a nanorod with radius equal to the
characteristic radius after some transient layers. Otherwise the nanorod
morphology can be maintained during the growth, with stable radius being
limited by both the radius of the initial island and the three-dimensional
Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier. Therefore different growth modes and diameter of
nanorod can be selected by tuning the characteristic radius. The theoretical
predictions are in good agreement with experimental observations of ZnO growth.

problem. This paper proposes a comparison study of genetic algorithm and list
scheduling algorithm. Both algorithms are naturally parallelizable but have
heavy data dependencies. Based on experimental results, this paper presents a
detailed analysis of the scalability, advantages and disadvantages of each
algorithm. Multiprocessors have emerged as a powerful computing means for
running real-time applications, especially where a uni-processor system would
not be sufficient enough to execute all the tasks. The high performance and
reliability of multiprocessors have made them a powerful computing resource.
Such computing environment requires an efficient algorithm to determine when
and on which processor a given task should execute. In multiprocessor systems,
an efficient scheduling of a parallel program onto the processors that
minimizes the entire execution time is vital for achieving a high performance.
This scheduling problem is known to be NP- Hard. In multiprocessor scheduling
problem, a given program is to be scheduled in a given multiprocessor system
such that the program's execution time is minimized. The last job must be
completed as early as possible. Genetic algorithm (GA) is one of the widely
used techniques for constrained optimization.

amounts of data. There are many data mining tasks, such as classification,
clustering, association rule mining, and sequential pattern mining. Sequential
pattern mining finds sets of data items that occur together frequently in some
sequences. Sequential pattern mining, which extracts frequent subsequences from
a sequence database, has attracted a great deal of interest during the recent
data mining research because it is the basis of many applications, such as: web
user analysis, stock trend prediction, DNA sequence analysis, finding language
or linguistic patterns from natural language texts, and using the history of
symptoms to predict certain kind of disease. The diversity of the applications
may not be possible to apply a single sequential pattern model to all these
problems. Each application may require a unique model and solution. A number of
research projects were established in recent years to develop meaningful
sequential pattern models and efficient algorithms for mining these patterns.
In this paper, we theoretically provided a brief overview three types of
sequential patterns model.

gluon bremsstrahlung, medium modification of parton fragmentation functions and
therefore the suppression of large transverse momentum hadron spectra are
controlled by both the value and the space-time profile of the jet transport
parameter along the jet propagation path. Experimental data on single hadron
suppression in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the RHIC energy are analyzed
within the higher-twist (HT) approach to the medium modified fragmentation
functions and the next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) parton
model. Assuming that the jet transport parameter $\hat q$ is proportional to
the particle number density in both QGP and hadronic phase, experimental data
on jet quenching in deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) off nuclear targets can
provide guidance on $\hat q_{h}$ in the hot hadronic matter. One can then study
the dependence of extracted initial value of jet quenching parameter $\hat
q_{0}$ at initial time $\tau_{0}$ on the bulk medium evolution. Effects of
transverse expansion, radial flow, phase transition and non-equilibrium
evolution are examined. The extracted values are found to vary from $\hat
q_{0}\tau_{0}= 0.54$ GeV$^{2}$ in the (1+3)d ideal hydrodynamic model to 0.96
GeV$^{2}$ in a cascade model, with the main differences coming from the initial
non-equilibrium evolution and the later hadronic evolution. The overall
contribution to jet quenching from the hadronic phase, about 22-44%, is found
to be significant. Therefore, realistic description of the early
non-equilibrium parton evolution and later hadronic interaction will be
critical for accurate extraction of the jet transport parameter in the strongly
interacting QGP phase in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.

in terms of the light-front quark model (LFQM). Recently CLEO and BaBar
collaborations have measured $\mathcal{B}(\Upsilon(3S)\to\gamma\eta_b)$ and the
mass of ${\eta_b}$. In terms of the data we fix the concerned input parameters
in our calculations of $\Upsilon(nS)\to \eta_b+\gamma$. A special attention is
paid on the transition of $\Upsilon(5S)\to \eta_b+\gamma$. The BELLE data
showed that the width of $\Upsilon(5S)\to \Upsilon(2S,1S)+\pi\pi$ is two orders
larger than that of $\Upsilon(4S)\to \Upsilon(2S,1S)+\pi\pi$, thus some
theoretical explanations have been proposed. Among them, it is suggested the
inelastic final state interaction (IFSI) $\Upsilon(5S)\to B\bar B\to
\Upsilon(1S)+\pi\pi$ may be a natural one. If so, a similar mechanism also
applies to $\Upsilon(5S)\to B^{(*)}\bar B^{(*)}\to \eta_b+\gamma$, the precise
measurement would serve as a good test whether $\Upsilon(5S)$ possess exotic
components. Our calculation in the LFQM indicates that the rate of the direct
process $\Upsilon(5S)\to\eta_b+\gamma$ is not anomalous compared to
$\Upsilon(mS)\to\eta_b+\gamma (m=1,2,3,4)$, thus if the IFSI does apply, the
rate of $\Upsilon(5S)\to\eta_b+\gamma$ should be larger than the others by
orders.

designing instruments. High-resolution and high-accuracy spectra are required
for verifying hydrodynamic stellar atmospheres and for resolving intergalactic
absorption-line structures in quasars. Even with great photon fluxes from large
telescopes with matching spectrometers, precise measurements of line profiles
and wavelength positions encounter various physical, observational, and
instrumental limits. The analysis may be limited by astrophysical and telluric
blends, lack of suitable lines, imprecise laboratory wavelengths, or
instrumental imperfections. To some extent, such limits can be pushed by
forming averages over many similar spectral lines, thus averaging away small
random blends and wavelength errors. In situations where theoretical
predictions of lineshapes and shifts can be accurately made (e.g., hydrodynamic
models of solar-type stars), the consistency between noisy observations and
theoretical predictions may be verified; however this is not feasible for,
e.g., the complex of intergalactic metal lines in spectra of distant quasars,
where the primary data must come from observations. To more fully resolve
lineshapes and interpret wavelength shifts in stars and quasars alike, spectral
resolutions on order R=300,000 or more are required; a level that is becoming
(but is not yet) available. A grand challenge remains to design efficient
spectrometers with resolutions approaching R=1,000,000 for the forthcoming
generation of extremely large telescopes.

SoHO-SUMER observations of the true spectral line profile of hydrogen
Lyman-alpha in quiescent prominences. With SoHO not being in Earth orbit, our
high-quality data set is free from geocoronal absorption. We study the line
profile and compare it with earlier observations of the higher Lyman lines and
recent model predictions. Methods: We applied the reduced-aperture observing
mode to two prominence targets and started a statistical analysis of the line
profiles in both data sets. In particular, we investigated the shape of the
profile, the radiance distribution and the line shape-to-radiance
interrelation. We also compare Ly-a data to co-temporal 1206 Si III data.
Results: We find that the average profile of Ly-a has a blue-peak dominance and
is more reversed, if the line-of-sight is perpendicular to the field lines. The
contrast of Ly-a prominence emission rasters is very low and the radiance
distribution differs from the log-normal distribution of the disk. Features
seen in the Si III line are not always co-spatial with Ly-a emission.
Conclusions: Our empirical results support recent multi-thread models, which
predict that asymmetries and depths of the self-reversal depend on the
orientation of the prominence axis relative to the line-of-sight.

of deformations of general relativity characterized by the absence of new
degrees of freedom. The homogeneous and isotropic background in this class of
theories is unmodified and is described by the usual Friedmann equations. The
theory of cosmological perturbations is modified and the relevant deformation
parameter has the dimension of length. Gravitational perturbations of the
scalar type can be described by a certain relativistic potential related to the
matter perturbations just as in general relativity. A system of differential
equations describing the evolution of this potential and of the stress-energy
density perturbations is obtained. We find that the evolution of scalar
perturbations proceeds with a modified effective time-dependent speed of sound,
which, contrary to the case of general relativity, does not vanish even at the
matter-dominated stage. In a broad range of values of the length parameter
controlling the deformation, a specific transition from the regime of modified
gravity to the regime of general relativity in the evolution of scalar
perturbations takes place during the radiation domination. In this case, the
resulting power spectrum of perturbations in radiation and dark matter is
suppressed on the comoving spatial scales that enter the Hubble radius before
this transition. We estimate the bounds on the deformation parameter for which
this suppression does not lead to observable consequences. Evolution of scalar
perturbations at the inflationary stage is modified but very slightly and the
primordial spectrum generated during inflation is not noticeably different from
the one obtained in general relativity.

by 100 ms. The short time delay and the nearly symmetric cross-correlation

indicate that the bright and highly variable infrared emission most likely
comes from a jet near the black hole. Under standard assumptions about jet

density enhancements that may subsequently go on to form stars. The stronger
the turbulence - the higher the Mach number - the more extreme the density
fluctuations are expected to be. Numerical models predict an increase in
density variance with rms Mach number of the form: sigma^{2}_{rho/rho_{0}} =
b^{2}M^{2}, where b is a numerically-estimated parameter, and this prediction
forms the basis of a large number of analytic models of star formation. We
provide an estimate of the parameter b from 13CO J=1-0 spectral line imaging
observations and extinction mapping of the Taurus molecular cloud, using a
recently developed technique that needs information contained solely in the
projected column density field to calculate sigma^{2}_{rho/rho_{0}}. We find b
~ 0.48, which is consistent with typical numerical estimates, and is
characteristic of turbulent driving that includes a mixture of solenoidal and
compressive modes. More conservatively, we constrain b to lie in the range
0.3-0.8, depending on the influence of sub-resolution structure and the role of
diffuse atomic material in the column density budget. We also report a break in
the Taurus column density power spectrum at a scale of ~1pc, and find that the
break is associated with anisotropy in the power spectrum. The break is
observed in both 13CO and dust extinction power spectra, which, remarkably, are
effectively identical despite detailed spatial differences between the 13CO and
dust extinction maps. [ abridged ]

case of exponentially anisotropic (van den Berg) boxes, when there are two

Condensation (BEC). Here $\rho_c$ is the standard critical density for the PBG.
We consider three examples of anisotropic geometry: slabs, squared beams and

$\rho_c < \rho < \rho_m$ is in fact the van den Berg-Lewis-Pul\'e generalised

separates quasi-1D and 3D regimes. We calculate the value of difference between

speed of its bar. Indeed, it is related to the location of corotation where

The only direct method for measuring the bar pattern speed is the
Tremaine-Weinberg technique. This method is best suited to the analysis of the
distribution and kinematics of the stellar component in absence of significant
star formation and patchy dust obscuration. Therefore, it has been mostly used
for early-type barred galaxies. The main sources of uncertainties on the
directly-measured bar pattern speeds are discussed. There are attempts to
overcome the selection bias of the current sample of direct measurements by
extending the application of the Tremaine-Weinberg method to the gaseous

on the analysis of the gas distribution and kinematics. They have been largely
used to measure the bar pattern speed in late-type barred galaxies. Nearly all
the bars measured with direct and indirect methods end close to their
corotation radius, i.e., they are as rapidly rotating as they can be.

formation and evolution. However, theoretical predictions of the system's
properties seem inconsistent with observations: i. The more massive (primary)
component is observed to be cooler than the less massive (secondary) one. ii.
The secondary is more luminous (by roughly 10^{24} W) than expected. We study
the impact of tidal heating to the energy budget of both components. We also
compare various plausible tidal models to determine a range of predicted
properties. We apply two versions of two different, well-known models for tidal
interaction, respectively, (i.) the 'constant-phase-lag' model and (ii.) the
'constant-time-lag' model, and incorporate the predicted tidal heating into a
model of BD structure. We find that the contribution of heat from tides in
2M0535-05 alone may only be large enough to account for the discrepancies
between observation and theory in an unlikely region of the parameter space.
The tidal quality factor of BDs, Q_{BD}, would have to be 10^{3.5} and the
secondary needs a spin-orbit misalignment greater than 50 degrees. However,
tidal synchronization time scales for 2M0535-05 restrict the tidal dissipation
function Q_{BD} to values greater than 10^{4.5} and rule out intense tidal
heating in 2M0535-05. We provide the first constraint on Q_{BD}. Tidal heating
alone is unlikely to be responsible for the surprising temperature reversal
within 2M0535-05. But an evolutionary embedment of tidal effects and a coupled
treatment with the structural evolution of the BDs is necessary to corroborate
or refute this result.

address the growing challenges of capturing and processing high-dimensional

contained in a sparse signal can be preserved in a small number of compressive
(or random) linear measurements of that signal. Strong theoretical guarantees
have been established on the accuracy to which sparse or near-sparse signals
can be recovered from noisy compressive measurements. In this paper, we address
similar questions in the context of a different modeling framework. Instead of
sparse models, we focus on the broad class of manifold models, which can arise
in both parametric and non-parametric signal families. Building upon recent
results concerning the stable embeddings of manifolds within the measurement
space, we establish both deterministic and probabilistic instance-optimal
bounds in $\ell_2$ for manifold-based signal recovery and parameter estimation
from noisy compressive measurements. In line with analogous results for
sparsity-based CS, we conclude that much stronger bounds are possible in the

well established mass luminosity relations are used. We find evidence of a
lensing signal with a 2.3 sigma significance. The current result is limited by
the number of SNe, their redshift distribution, and the other sources of
scatter in the Hubble diagram. Separating the galaxy population into a red and
a blue sample has a positive impact on the significance of the signal
detection. On the other hand, increasing the depth of the galaxy catalog, the
precision of photometric redshifts or reducing the scatter in the mass
luminosity relations have little effect. We show that for the full SuperNova
