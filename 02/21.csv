concentration sensing by single-celled organisms is limited by noise from the
small number of counted molecules. Here we generalize their results to the
sensing of concentration ramps, which is often the biologically relevant
situation (e.g. during bacterial chemotaxis). We calculate lower bounds on the
uncertainty of ramp sensing by three measurement devices: a single receptor, an
absorbing sphere, and a monitoring sphere. We contrast two strategies, simple
linear regression of the input signal versus maximum likelihood estimation, and
show that the latter can be twice as accurate as the former. Finally, we
consider biological implementations of these two strategies, and identify
possible signatures that maximum likelihood estimation is implemented by real
biological systems.

Moreover, it can be deduced from the free quantum evolution. This way new,

argued that the above construction defines in a natural way a connection in the

the non-existence of a quantum representation of the complete algebra of

using the volume fraction of the overdense regions $\lambda_{\CM}$ as its
characterizing parameter. Employing results from cosmological perturbation
theory and extrapolating the leading mode into the nonlinear regime, we
construct a three--parameter model for the effective cosmic expansion history,
involving $\lambda_{\CM_{0}}$, the matter density $\Omega_{m}^{\CD_{0}}$, and
the Hubble rate $H_{\CD_{0}}$ of today's Universe. Taking standard values for
$\Omega_{m}^{\CD_{0}}$ and $H_{\CD_{0}}$ as well as a reasonable value for
$\lambda_{\CM_{0}}$, that we derive from $N$--body simulations, we determine
the corresponding amounts of backreaction and spatial curvature. We find that
the obtained values that are sufficient to generate today's structure also lead
to a $\Lambda$CDM--like behavior of the scale factor, parametrized by the same
parameters $\Omega_{m}^{\CD_{0}}$ and $H_{\CD_{0}}$, but without a cosmological
constant. However, the temporal behavior of $\lambda_{\CM}$ does not faithfully
reproduce the structure formation history. Surprisingly, however, the model
matches with structure formation with the assumption of a low matter content,
$\Omega_{m}^{\CD_{0}}\approx3\%$, a result that hints to a different
interpretation of part of the backreaction effect as kinematical Dark Matter.

phonons the molecule level position ($\epsilon_d$) and the electron-electron
interaction ($U$) undergo a \emph{polaronic shift} which affects dramatically
the electronic transport through the molecular junction. When the
electron-phonon interaction is weak the linear conductance presents Fano-line
shapes as long as the direct channel between the electrodes is opened. The
observed Fano resonances in the linear conductance are originated from the
interference between the spin Kondo state and the direct path. For strong
enough electron-phonon interaction, the electron-electron interaction is
renormalized towards negative values, {\it i.e.} becomes effectively
attractive. This scenario favors fluctuations between the empty and doubly
occupied charge states and therefore promotes a charge Kondo effect. However,
the direct path between the contacts breaks the electron-hole symmetry which
can efficiently suppress this charge Kondo effect. Nevertheless, we show that a
proper tuning of the gate voltage is able to revive the Kondo resonance. Our
results are obtained by using the Numerical Renormalization approximation to

system (player) has incomplete information about the other player's channel
conditions. A trivial Nash equilibrium point in this game is where players
mutually full spread (FS) their transmit spectrum and interfere with each
other. This point may lead to poor spectrum utilization from a global network
point of view and even for each user individually.
  In this paper, we provide a closed form expression for a non pure-FS
epsilon-Nash equilibrium point; i.e., an equilibrium point where players choose
FDM for some channel realizations and FS for the others. We show that operating
in this non pure-FS epsilon-Nash equilibrium point increases each user's
throughput and therefore improves the spectrum utilization, and demonstrate
that this performance gain can be substantial. Finally, important insights are
provided into the behaviour of selfish and rational wireless users as a
function of the channel parameters such as fading probabilities, the
interference-to-signal ratio.

Understanding how the properties of the packaged polymer affect the assembly
process could promote biomedical efforts to prevent viral assembly or

lattice the dynamical assembly of closed, hollow shells composed of several
hundred to 1000 subunits, around a flexible polymer. We find that assembly is
most efficient at an optimum polymer length that scales with the surface area
of the capsid; significantly longer than optimal polymers often lead to
partial-capsids with unpackaged polymer `tails' or a competition between
multiple partial-capsids attached to a single polymer. These predictions can be
tested with bulk experiments in which capsid proteins assemble around
homopolymeric RNA or synthetic polyelectrolytes. We also find that the polymer
can increase the net rate of subunit accretion to a growing capsid both by
stabilizing the addition of new subunits and by enhancing the incoming flux of
subunits; the effects of these processes may be distinguishable with
experiments that monitor the assembly of individual capsids.

literature (Raut, S and Datta, D P (2009), Fractals, 17, 45-52) is shown to
enjoy some novel properties. The ultrametric $d_{u}$ is defined using the
concept of {\em relative infinitesimals} and an {\em inversion} rule. The
associated (infinitesimal) valuation which turns out to be both scale and
reparametrisation invariant, is identified with the Cantor function associated
with a Cantor set $\tilde C$ where the relative infinitesimals are supposed to
live in. These ultrametrics are both metrically as well as topologically
inequivalent compared to the topology induced by the usual metric. Every point
of the original Cantor set $C$ is identified with the closure of the set of
gaps of $\tilde C$. The increments on such an ultrametric space is accomplished
by following the inversion rule. As a consequence, Cantor functions are
reinterpretd as (every where) locally constant on these extended ultrametric
spaces. An interesting phenomenon, called {\em growth of measure}, is studied
on such an ultrametric space. Using the reparametrisation invariance of the
valuation it is shown how the scale factors of a Lebesgue measure zero Cantor
set might get {\em deformed} leading to a {\em deformed} Cantor set with a
positive measure. The definition of a new {\em valuated exponent} is introduced
which is shown to yield the fatness exponent in the case of a positive measure
(fat) Cantor set. However, the valuated exponent can also be used to
distinguish Cantor sets with identical Hausdorff dimension and thickness. A
class of Cantor sets with Hausdorff dimension $\log_3 2$ and thickness 1 are
constructed explicitly.

normal CMEs, which was a long-standing puzzle. In order to solve the puzzle, we
first investigate the observed properties of 31 limb CMEs that display clearly
loop-shaped frontal loops. The observational results show a strong tendency
that slower CMEs are weaker in the white-light intensity. Then, we perform a
Monte Carlo simulation of 20 000 artificial limb CMEs that have average
velocity of $\sim$523 km s$^{-1}$. The Thomson scattering of these events is
calculated when they are assumed to be observed as limb and halo events,
respectively. It is found that the white-light intensity of many slow CMEs
becomes remarkably reduced as they turn from being viewed as a limb event to as
a halo event. When the intensity is below the background solar wind
fluctuation, it is assumed that they would be missed by coronagraphs. The
average velocity of ""detectable"" halo CMEs is $\sim$922 km s$^{-1}$, very close
to the observed value. It also indicates that wider events are more likely to
be recorded. The results soundly suggest that the higher average velocity of
halo CMEs is due to that a majority of slow events and a part of narrow fast
events carrying less material are so faint that they are blended with the solar
wind fluctuations, and therefore are not observed.

magnetic field in the corona. It is found that the two parameters show
significant negative correlation in most of the EIT wave fronts, {\it i.e.},
EIT wave propagates more slowly in the regions of stronger magnetic field. Such
a result poses a big challenge to the fast-mode wave model, which would predict
a strong positive correlation between the two parameters. However, it is
demonstrated that such a result can be explained by the fieldline stretching
model, \emph{i.e.,} that ""EIT waves"" are apparently-propagating brightenings,

as its mass varies proves a rich source of discussion in a physics class-room,
overcoming erroneous notions carried forward by students as to what constitutes
a pendulum's length due to picking up only the results of approximations and
ignoring the rigorous definition. The discussion also presents a exercise for
evaluating center of mass of geometrical shapes and system of bodies. In all,
the pedagogical value of the problem is worth both theoretical and experimental
efforts. This article discusses the theoretical considerations.

merit (ZT) of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) embedded into an insulator
matrix connected with metallic electrodes are theoretically investigated in the
Coulomb blockade regime. The multilevel Anderson model is used to simulate the
multiple QDs junction system. The charge and heat currents in the sequential
tunneling process are calculated by the Keldysh Green function technique. In
the linear response regime the ZT values are still very impressive in the small
tunneling rates case, although the effect of electron Coulomb interaction on ZT
is significant. In the nonlinear response regime, we have demonstrated that the
thermal rectification behavior can be observed for the coupled QDs system,
where the very strong asymmetrical coupling between the dots and electrodes,
large energy level separation between dots and strong interdot Coulomb
interactions are required.

relation between the momentum of a string and its density of particles, E,
which is reminiscent of a dispersion relation, E=k^2. Strings interact: they
can merge and split and within these processes momentum is conserved. We reveal
the role of the modular group SL(2,Z) behind these laws.

  It transpires that this involves the computation of the smallest eigenvalue

may be expressed in terms of Jack polynomials.
  Furthermore, based on the exact results, we found, a limiting distribution,
when the smallest eigenvalue is suitably scaled with $N$ followed by a large
$N$ limit. Our results turn out to be the same as the smallest eigenvalue
distribution of the classical Laguerre ensembles without the fixed trace
constraint. This suggests in a broad sense, the global constraint does not
influence local correlations, at least, in the large $N$ limit.
  Consequently, we have solved an open problem: The determination of the
smallest eigenvalue distribution of the reduced density matrix---obtained by
tracing out the environmental degrees of freedom---for a bipartite quantum
system of unequal dimensions.
