X-ray binaries to three Z-track sources: GX340+0, GX5-1 and CygX-2, we propose
an explanation of the CygnusX-2 like Z-track sources. The Normal Branch is
dominated by the increasing radiation pressure of the neutron star caused by a
mass accretion rate that increases between the soft apex and the hard apex. The
radiation pressure continues to increase on the Horizontal Branch becoming
several times super-Eddington. We suggest that this disrupts the inner
accretion disk and that part of the accretion flow is diverted vertically
forming jets which are detected by their radio emission on this part of the
Z-track. We thus propose that high radiation pressure is the necessary
condition for the launching of jets. On the Flaring Branch there is a large
increase in the neutron star blackbody luminosity at constant mass accretion
rate indicating an additional energy source on the neutron star. We find that
there is good agreement between the mass accretion rate per unit emitting area
of the neutron star mdot at the onset of flaring and the theoretical critical
value at which burning becomes unstable. We thus propose that flaring in the
CygnusX-2 like sources consists of unstable nuclear burning. Correlation of
measurements of kilohertz QPO frequencies in all three sources with spectral
fitting results leads to the proposal that the upper kHz QPO is an oscillation
always taking place at the inner accretion disk edge, the radius of which
increases due to disruption of the disk by the high radiation pressure of the
neutron star.

required solvency margin does not depend of the asset allocation. It is quite
different in the Solvency 2 framework because the target capital has to control
the global risk of the company. And the financial risk takes part of this
global risk. Thus the economic equities maximization criterion leads to search
a couple asset allocation / equities which solves a stochastic program. A
numerical illustration makes it possible to analyze the consequences of the

Our model tracks the evolution of the SNR including the plasma ionization state
between the forward shock and the contact discontinuity. We use a plasma
emissivity code to predict the thermal X-ray emission spectrum assuming the
initially cold electrons are heated either by Coulomb collisions with the shock
heated protons (the slowest possible heating), or come into instant
equilibration with the protons. For either electron heating model, electrons
reach >10^7 K rapidly and the X-ray line emission near 1 keV is more than 10
times as luminous as the underlying thermal bremsstrahlung continuum. Since
recent Suzaku observations show no detectable line emission, this places strong
constraints on the unshocked ambient medium density and on the relativistic
electron to proton ratio. For the uniform circumstellar medium (CSM) models we
consider, the low densities and high relativistic electron to proton ratios
required to match the Suzaku X-ray observations definitively rule out
pion-decay as the emission process producing GeV-TeV photons. We show that
leptonic models, where inverse-Compton scattering against the cosmic background
radiation dominates the GeV-TeV emission, produce better fits to the broad-band

Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO) QCD corrections to Higgs plus two jet production at
hadron colliders. In these calculations the Higgs boson couples to gluons via a
top-quark loop which is integrated out to form an effective vertex. The
amplitudes are further simplified by splitting the real Higgs scalar into the
sum of two complex scalars phi and phi^dagger. Four-dimensional unitarity is
used to construct the cut-containing pieces of the amplitude, while a variety
of bootstrap and Feynman diagram techniques are used to construct the rational
pieces. The results described here are valid in the limit of a large top quark
mass and when the transverse momenta of the jets are less than mt.

spectroscopic observations of a galaxy, A1689-7.1 at z=4.87, near this
structure, revealed a possible overdense region of inter-galactic medium (IGM)
around the galaxy, which extends at least ~80 comoving Mpc along the line of
sight. In order to investigate whether this z~5 IGM overdense region contains a
galaxy overdensity, we undertook narrow- and broad-band imaging observations
around A1689-7.1 with Subaru/Suprime-Cam. We detected 51 candidate Ly-alpha
emitters at redshift z=4.86+-0.03 in the 32 x 24 arcmin^2 field of view. After
correction for lensing by the foreground cluster, we found a large-scale (~20 x
60 comoving Mpc) overdense region of galaxies around A1689-7.1 in the source
plane at z=4.86. The densest peak in this region has an overdensity of delta~4,
suggesting that this structure is probably a good candidate for a protocluster.
A1689-7.1 is located at the edge of this region, where the local galaxy density
is ~1.6 times the mean density and is close to the density contrast in the IGM
along the line of sight to A1689-7.1 estimated from the optical depth. The
overdensities of galaxies we have found may suggest that at least some parts of
the IGM overdense region have already started to form galaxies and moreover
they relate to the formation of a protocluster. Although we lack information on
the three dimensional distributions of both IGM and galaxy overdense regions,
the similarity of the scales of both regions may suggest that the two are parts
of a single large-scale structure, which would be an large edge-on sheet along
the line of sight with a size of ~20 x 60 x 80 comoving Mpc.

that the cycles are stable under all conditions tested. Next, we extend our
analysis to a small autocatalytic cycle, and determine parameter regimes within
which the cycle is very likely to be stable. We demonstrate that analytical
methods can be used to understand the relationship between kinetic parameters
and stability, and that results from these analytical methods can be confirmed
with computational experiments. In addition, our results suggest that elevated
metabolite concentrations and certain crucial saturation parameters can
strongly affect the stability of the entire metabolic cycle. We discuss our
results in light of the possibility that evolutionary forces may select for
metabolic network topologies with a high intrinsic probability of being stable.
Furthermore, our conclusions support the hypothesis that certain types of
metabolic cycles may have played a role in the development of primitive
metabolism despite the absence of regulatory mechanisms.

this approach by recovering the original packets from multiple collisions. In
this paper, we present an algebraic representation of collisions which allows
us to view each collision as a linear combination of the original packets. The
transmitted, colliding packets may themselves be a coded version of the
original packets.
  We propose a new acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism for collisions based on the
idea that if a set of packets collide, the receiver can afford to ACK exactly
one of them and still decode all the packets eventually. We analytically
compare delay and throughput performance of such collision recovery schemes
with other collision avoidance approaches in the context of a single hop
wireless erasure network. In the multiple receiver case, the broadcast
constraint calls for combining collision recovery methods with network coding
across packets at the sender. From the delay perspective, our scheme, without
any coordination, outperforms not only a ALOHA-type random access mechanisms,
but also centralized scheduling. For the case of streaming arrivals, we propose
a priority-based ACK mechanism and show that its stability region coincides
with the cut-set bound of the packet erasure network.

cluster in the overlap region of the interacting galaxies NGC 4038/39 using
population synthesis models. Our goal is to model the cluster population as
well as provide rough constraints on its initial mass function (IMF). The
cluster shows signs of youth such as thermal radio emission and strong hydrogen
emission lines in the near-infrared. Late-type absorption lines are also
present which are indicative of late-type stars in the cluster. The strength
and ratio of these absorption lines cannot be reproduced through either
late-type pre-main sequence (PMS) stars or red supergiants alone. Thus we
interpret the spectrum as a superposition of two star clusters of different
ages, which is feasible since the 1"" spectrum encompasses a physical region of
~90 pc and radii of super-star clusters are generally measured to be a few
parsecs. One cluster is young (<= 3 Myr) and is responsible for part of the
late-type absorption features, which are due to PMS stars in the cluster, and
the hydrogen emission lines. The second cluster is older (6 Myr - 18 Myr) and
is needed to reproduce the overall depth of the late-type absorption features
in the spectrum. Both are required to accurately reproduce the near-infrared
spectrum of the object. Thus we have directly detected PMS objects in an
unresolved super-star cluster for the first time using a combination of
population synthesis models and pre-main sequence tracks. This analysis serves
as a testbed of our technique to constrain the low-mass IMF in young super-star
clusters as well as an exploration of the star formation history of young UC
HII regions.

of correlation to contributions of emission from multiple components, in

broadband spectrum in 2000, in 2005 the accretion disc seems to be more
prominent and we use an analysis of the lightcurves and spectra to distinguish
between the jet and disc emission. There also appears to be an optically thin

multiple ejection events and decaying as the outburst proceeds. These results

re-identified the components according to the new scenario presented in this

study of the long-term kinematics reveals a new picture for component motion in
S5 1803+784. In contrast to previously discussed motion scenarios, we find that
the jet structure within 12 mas of the core can most easily be described by the
coexistence of several bright jet features that remain on the long-term at
roughly constant core separations (in addition to the already known {\it
stationary} jet component $\sim$ 1.4 mas) and one faint component moving with
an apparent superluminal speed ($\sim$ 19c, based on 3 epochs). While most of
the components maintain long-term roughly constant distances from the core, we
observe significant, smooth changes in their position angles. We report on an
evolution of the whole jet ridge line with time over the almost 12 years of
observations. The width of the jet changes periodically with a period of $\sim$
8 to 9 years. We find a correlation between changes in the position angle and
maxima in the total flux-density. We present evidence for a geometric origin of

resources are heterogeneous, dynamic, and multidomain. Authentication remains
as the significant security challenge in grid environment. In traditional
authentication protocol a single server stores the sensitive user credentials,

one unit and these units are stored in two different servers, namely,
Authentication Server and Backend Server. Only when the combined authentication
scheme from both the servers authenticates the user, the privilege of accessing
the requested resources is obtained by the user. The main advantage of
utilizing the dual authentication protocol in grid computing is that an
adversary user cannot attain the access privilege by compromising a single
consolidated server because of the fact that the split password is stored in
different servers.

Liggett, and Romik's k-percolation models, and in the process provide a unified
and improved treatment of existing results for bootstrap, modified bootstrap,
and Frobose percolation. Furthermore, we prove improved asymptotic bounds for
the generating functions of partitions without k-gaps, which are also related
to certain infinite probability processes relevant to these percolation models.
  One of our key technical probability results is also of independent interest.
We prove new upper and lower bounds for the probability that a sequence of
independent events with monotonically increasing probabilities contains no
""k-gap"" patterns, which interpolates the general Markov chain solution that
arises in the case that all of the probabilities are equal.

holography leads to a semi-classical first approximation to the spectrum and
wavefunctions of meson and baryon light-quark bound states. Starting from the
bound-state Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD, we derive relativistic
light-front wave equations in terms of an invariant impact variable zeta which
measures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron
at equal light-front time. These equations of motion in physical space-time are
equivalent to the equations of motion which describe the propagation of spin-J
modes in anti--de Sitter (AdS) space. Its eigenvalues give the hadronic
spectrum, and its eigenmodes represent the probability distributions of the
hadronic constituents at a given scale. Applications to the light meson and
baryon spectra are presented. The predicted meson spectrum has a string-theory
Regge form ${\cal M}^2 = 4 \kappa^2(n+L+S/2)$; i.e., the square of the
eigenmass is linear in both L and n, where n counts the number of nodes of the
wavefunction in the radial variable zeta. The space-like pion and nucleon form
factors are also well reproduced. One thus obtains a remarkable connection
between the description of hadronic modes in AdS space and the Hamiltonian
formulation of QCD in physical space-time quantized on the light-front at fixed
light-front time. The model can be systematically improved by using its
complete orthonormal solutions to diagonalize the full QCD light-front
Hamiltonian or by applying the Lippmann-Schwinger method in order to
systematically include the QCD interaction terms.

anomalies have been observed in three temperature regions: in the gamma-phase
from 930C to 950C; at ~370C, Neel temperature (TN), and at ~123C, due to a
phase transition of unknown type (magnetic or structural). An attempt has been
made to understand the origin of the weak phonon-magnon coupling and the
dynamics of the phase sequence. The disappearance of several Raman modes at
~820C (Tc) is compatible with the known structural phase transition and the
Pbnm orthoferrite space group assigned by Arnold {\it et al.} \cite{arnold:09}.
The spectra also revealed a {\it non-cubic} $\beta$-phase from 820-930\dc and
the same {\it non-cubic} phase extends through the $\gamma$-phase between
930-950\dc, in agreement with Arnold {\it et al.} \cite{arnold2:09}, and an
evidence of a cubic $\delta$-phase around 1000\dc in thin films that is not
stable in powder and bulk. Such a cubic phase has been theoretically predicted
in \cite{vasquez:prb09}. Micro-Raman scattering and X-ray diffraction showed no
structural decomposition in thin films during the thermal cycling from
22-1000\dc.

higher-sigma, rich clusters. From this result, we infer that over this redshift
range galaxy-galaxy interactions, which are more effective in lower-sigma
environments, are more responsible for transforming spiral galaxies into S0's
than galaxy-environment processes, which are more effective in higher-sigma
environments. The rapid, recent growth of the S0 population in groups and poor
clusters implies that large numbers of progenitors exist in low-sigma systems
at modest redshifts (~ 0.5), where morphologies and internal kinematics are
within the measurement range of current technology.

clusters are formed following a cluster initial mass function (CMF) similar to
the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Both the IMF and the CMF favour
low-mass objects. The numerous low-mass clusters will lack high mass stars. If
the integrated galactic initial mass function originates from stars formed in
clusters, the IGIMF could be steeper than the IMF. We investigate how well
constrained this steepening is and how it depends on the choice of sampling
method and CMF. We compare analytic sampling to several implementations of
random sampling of the IMF, and different CMFs. We implement different IGIMFs
into GALEV to obtain colours and metallicities for galaxies. Choosing different
ways of sampling the IMF results in different IGIMFs. Depending on the lower
cluster mass limit and the slope of the cluster mass function, the steepening
varies between very strong and negligible. We find the size of the effect is
continuous as a function of the power-law slope of the CMF, if the CMF extends
to masses smaller than the maximum stellarmass. The number of O-stars detected
by GAIA might help in judging on the importance of the IGIMF effect. The impact
of different IGIMFs on integrated galaxy photometry is small, within the
intrinsic scatter of observed galaxies. Observations of gas fractions and
metallicities could rule out at least the most extreme sampling methods. As we
still do not understand the details of star formation, one sampling method
cannot be favoured over another. Also, the CMF at very low cluster masses is
not well constrained observationally. These uncertainties need to be taken into
account when using an IGIMF, with severe implications for galaxy evolution
models and interpretations of galaxy observations.

looking at the evolution of the number and luminosity density of LRGs, as well

keep a large number of galaxies in our sample and put stringent constraints on
the growth and merging allowed by the data as a function of galaxy luminosity.
Introducing additional luminosity-dependent weighting for our clustering
analysis allows us to additionally constrain the nature of the mergers. We find
that, in the redshift range probed, the population of LRGs grows in luminosity
by 1.5-6 % Gyr^-1 depending on their luminosity. This growth is predominantly
happening in objects that reside in the lowest-mass haloes probed by this
study, and cannot be explained by satellite accretion into massive LRGs, nor by
LRG-LRG merging. We find that the evolution of the brightest objects (with a

principal steps. First, given a theta null point for $A$ and a subgroup $K$
isotropic for the Weil pairing, we explain how to compute the theta null point
corresponding to the quotient abelian variety $A/K$. Then, from the knowledge
of a theta null point of $A/K$, we give an algorithm to obtain a rational
expression for an isogeny from $A$ to $A/K$. The algorithm resulting as the
combination of these two steps can be viewed as a higher dimensional analog of
the well known algorithm of V\'elu to compute isogenies between elliptic
curves. In the case that $K$ is isomorphic to $(\Z / \ell \Z)^g$ for $\ell \in
\N^*$, the overall time complexity of this algorithm is equivalent to $O(\log
\ell)$ additions in $A$ and a constant number of $\ell^{th}$ root extractions
in the base field of $A$. In order to improve the efficiency of our algorithms,
we introduce a compressed representation that allows to encode a point of level
$4\ell$ of a $g$ dimensional abelian variety using only $g(g+1)/2\cdot 4^g$
coordinates. We also give formulas to compute the Weil and commutator pairings
given input points in theta coordinates.

Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants of knots for arbitrary representations, which

  We consider an algebraic construction of these categories, via an explicit
diagrammatic presentation, generalizing the cyclotomic quotient of the quiver
Hecke algebra. One of our primary results is that these categories coincide
when both are defined.
  We also investigate finer structure of these categories. Like many similar
representation-theoretic categories, they are standardly stratified and satisfy
a double centralizer property with respect to their self-dual modules. The
standard modules of the stratification play an important role, as Vermas do in
more classical representation theory, as test objects for functors.
  The existence of these representations has consequences for the structure of
previously studied categorifications; it allows us to prove the non-degeneracy
of Khovanov and Lauda's 2-category (that its Hom spaces have the expected
dimension) in all symmetrizable types, and that the cyclotomic quiver Hecke

active users sharing $u$ frequency sub-bands. Users are asynchronous meaning
there exists a mutual delay between their transmitted codes. A stationary model
for interference is considered by assuming the starting point of an
interferer's data is uniformly distributed along the codeword of any user. This
model is not ergodic, however, we show that the noise plus interference process
satisfies an Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) under certain conditions.
This enables us to define achievable rates in the conventional Shannon sense.
The spectrum is divided to private and common bands. Each user occupies its
assigned private band and the common band upon activation. In a scenario where
all transmitters are unaware of the number of active users and the channel
gains, the optimum spectrum assignment is obtained such that the so-called
outage capacity per user is maximized. If $\Pr\{\mathbf{n}>2\}>0$, all users
follow a locally Randomized On-Off signaling scheme on the common band where
each transmitter quits transmitting its Gaussian signals independently from
transmission to transmission. Achievable rates are developed using a
conditional version of Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) and an upper bound on the
differential entropy of a mixed Gaussian random variable. Thereafter, the
activation probability on each transmission slot together with the spectrum
assignment are designed resulting in the largest outage capacity.

variability suggests that characteristics time-scales are embedded in the light
curves of these objects. We argue that for blazar variability studies, the SF
results are sometimes erroneously interpreted leading to misconceptions about
the actual source properties. Based on extensive simulations we caution that
spurious breaks will appear in the SFs of almost all light curves, even though
these light curves may contain no intrinsic characteristic time-scales. i.e.
having a featureless underlying power-spectral-density (PSD). We show that the
time-scales of the spurious SF-breaks depend mainly on the length of the
artificial data set and also on the character of the variability i.e. the shape
of the PSD. The SF is often invoked in the framework of shot-noise models to
determine the temporal properties of individual shots. We caution that although
the SF may be fitted to infer the shot parameters, the resultant shot-noise
model is usually inconsistent with the observed PSD. As any model should fit
the data in both the time and the frequency domain the shot-noise model, in
these particular cases, can not be valid. Moreover, we show that the lack of
statistical independence between adjacent SF points, in the standard SF
formulation, means that it is not possible to perform robust statistical model
fitting following the commonly used least-squares fitting methodology. The
latter yields uncertainties in the fitting parameters (i.e. slopes, breaks)
that are far too small with respect to their true statistical scatter. Finally,
it is also commonly thought that SFs are immune to the sampling problems, such
as data gaps, which affects the estimators of the PSDs. However we show that
SFs are also troubled by gaps which can induce artefacts.

fields of engineering and physics, like oscillators, frequency synthesis,
telecommunications, radars, spectroscopy, in the emerging domain of microwave
photonics, and in more exotic domains like radio astronomy, particle
accelerators, etc.
  This article analyzes the two main types of phase noise in amplifiers, white
and flicker. White phase noise results from adding white noise to the RF
spectrum around the carrier. For a given amount of RF noise added, noise is
proportional to the inverse of the carrier power. By contrast, the 1/f
coefficient is a constant parameter of the amplifier, in a wide range of
carrier power. This fact has amazing consequences on different amplifier
topologies. Connecting m equal amplifiers in parallel, flicker is 1/m times
that of one device. Cascading m equal amplifiers, flicker is m times that of
one amplifier. Recirculating the signal in an amplifier so that the gain
increases by a power of m (a factor of m in dB) due to positive feedback
(regeneration), which for integer m is similar to the case of m amplifiers, we
find that flicker is m^2 times that of the amplifier alone.
  Starting from the fact that near-dc flicker exists in all electronic devices,
although generally not accessible from outside, the simplest model for the 1/f
phase noise is that the near-dc 1/f noise phase-modulates the carrier through
some parametric effect in the semiconductor. This model predicts the behavior
of the (simple) amplifier and of the different amplifier topologies. Numerous
measurements on amplifiers from different technologies and frequencies (HF to
microwaves), also including some obsolete amplifiers, validate the theory.

Algorithm for message detection and extraction is presented in detail. Two

analyzed. The results reveal that it is not secure to transmit message when the
message frequency locates at low power on power spectrum portrait. The proposed

along a general direction except the optic axes. The wave equation has a term
containing the second mixed partial derivative which originates from the
anisotropy, and this term can result in the rotation of the beam spot. The
rotation effect is investigated by solving analytically the wave equation with
an initial elliptical Gaussian beam for both uniaxial and biaxial media. For
both media, it is found that there exists a specific direction, which is
dependent on anisotropy of the media, on the cross-section perpendicular to
propagation direction to determine the rotation of the beam spot. When the
major axis of the elliptical spot of the input beam is parallel to or
perpendicular to the specific direction, the beam spot will not rotate during
propagation, otherwise, it will rotate with the direction and the velocity
determined by input parameters of the beam.

Here, we study silica with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), which until now was not
computationally possible for such complex materials, and find that QMC
overcomes the failures of DFT. QMC is a benchmark method that does not rely on
density functionals, but rather explicitly treats the electrons and their
interactions via a stochastic solution of Schrodinger's equation. Using ground
state QMC plus phonons within the quasiharmonic approximation from density
functional perturbation theory, we obtain the thermal pressure and equations of
state of silica phases up to Earth's core-mantle boundary. Our results provide
the most well-constrained equations of state and phase boundaries available for
silica. QMC indicates a transition to the most dense alpha-PbO2 structure above
the core-insulating D"" layer, suggesting the absence of significant free silica

waves (KAWs) with perpendicular wavelengths comparable to the ion gyroradius
and frequencies smaller than the ion cyclotron frequency. When the turbulence
amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, an ion's orbit becomes chaotic. The ion
then interacts stochastically with the time-varying electrostatic potential,
and the ion's energy undergoes a random walk. Using phenomenological arguments,
we derive an analytic expression for the rates at which different ion species
are heated, which we test by simulating test particles interacting with a
spectrum of randomly phased AWs and KAWs. We find that the stochastic heating
rate depends sensitively on the quantity epsilon = dv/vperp, where vperp is the
component of the ion velocity perpendicular to the background magnetic field
B0, and dv (dB) is the rms amplitude of the velocity (magnetic-field)
fluctuations at the gyroradius scale. In the case of thermal protons, when
epsilon << eps1, where eps1 is a constant, a proton's magnetic moment is nearly
conserved and stochastic heating is extremely weak. However, when epsilon >
eps1, the proton heating rate exceeds the cascade power that would be present
in strong balanced KAW turbulence with the same value of dv, and
magnetic-moment conservation is violated. For the random-phase waves in our
test-particle simulations, eps1 is approximately 0.2. For protons in low-beta
plasmas, epsilon is approximately dB/B0 divided by the square root of beta, and
epsilon can exceed eps1 even when dB/B0 << eps1. At comparable temperatures,
alpha particles and minor ions have larger values of epsilon than protons and
are heated more efficiently as a result. We discuss the implications of our
results for ion heating in coronal holes and the solar wind.

present a systematic comparison of theoretical predictions from different
quantum many-body theories with recent experimental data of Nascimbene et. al.

using a quantum cluster expansion theory and explore in detail its
applicability to low temperatures. Using the accurate experimental result for
the thermodynamic function $S(T)$, we determine the temperature $T$ of a
trapped Fermi gas at unitarity as a function of a non-interacting temperature
$T_{i}$ which can be obtained by an adiabatic sweep to the free gas limit. By
analyzing the recent experimental data, we find a normal-superfluid transition
temperature $(T/T_{F})_{c}=0.19\pm0.02$ or $(T_{i}/T_{F})_{c}=0.16\pm0.02$ in a

during uniaxial extension of a low density polyethylene is pre- sented. For
this purpose, traditional integral viscosity measurements on a Muenstedt type
extensional rheometer are combined with local mea- surements based on the
in-situ visualization of the sample under exten- sion. For elongational
experiments at constant strain rates within a wide range of Weissenberg numbers
(Wi), three distinct deformation regimes are identified. Corresponding to low
values of Wi (regime I), the tensile stress displays a broad maximum. This
maximum can be explained by simple mathematical arguments as a result of low
deformation rates and it should not be confused with the viscosity overshoot
phenomenon. Corre- sponding to intermediate values of Wi (regime II), a local
maximum of the integral extensional viscosity is systematically observed.
However, within this regime, the local viscosity measurements reveal no
maximum, but a plateau. Careful inspection of the images of samples within this
regime shows that, corresponding to the maximum of the integral viscosity, sec-
ondary necks develop along the sample. The emergence of a maximum of the
integral elongational viscosity is thus related to the distinct in- homogeneity
of deformation states and is not related to the rheological properties of the
material. In the fast stretching limit (high Wi, regime III), the overall
geometric uniformity of the sample is well preserved, no secondary necks are
observed and both the integral and the local transient elongational viscosity
show no maximum. A detailed comparison of the experimental findings with
results from literature is presented.

with the help of a binary collisions treatment which is valid for any strength
of the magnetic field and involves all harmonics of the particles cyclotron
motion. The energy transfer is explicitly calculated for a regularized and

classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) calculations which also allow to
investigate the strong collisions with large energy and velocity transfer at
low velocities. For large initial velocities on the other hand, only small
velocity transfers occur. There the nonperturbative numerical CTMC results
agree excellently with the predictions of the perturbative treatment.

mass-loss which leads to the formation of a Circumstellar Envelope (CSE) of

this evolutionary stage. In order to understand it, it is important to study
the physical parameters of the CSE. The emission of the CSE in the
(sub)millimetre range is dominated by the dust continuum. This means that
(sub)millimetre observations are a key tool in tracing the dust and improving
our knowledge of the mass-loss process.
  In this paper we analyse new sub-millimetre observations of 9 evolved stars
in order to constrain the CSE physical parameters. The data were taken by the
new APEX bolometer LABoCa.
  The fluxes at 870 um are derived and the extended emission is investigated.

transfer code, DUSTY which we compared to literature data. Grain properties are
calculated using both spherical grains distribution and a Continuous
Distribution of Ellipsoids (CDE) and a comparison between the two is drawn.
Synthetic surface brightness maps have been derived from the modelling and were
compared to the LABoCa brightness maps.
  We detected the presence of extended emission around four stars. Physical
parameters of the circumstellar envelope are derived from SED modelling, such
as the dust chemical composition, the dust condensation temperature and the
total mass of the envelope. It proves difficult however to fit the SED and the

survey of the inner Galactic Plane by mapping a two-degree wide strip in the
longitude range |l|<60 degrees in five wavebands between 70um and 500um. The
aim of Hi-GAL is to detect the earliest phases of the formation of molecular
clouds and high-mass stars and to use the optimum combination of Herschel
wavelength coverage, sensitivity, mapping strategy and speed to deliver a
homogeneous census of star-forming regions and cold structures in the
interstellar medium. The resulting representative samples will yield the
variation of source temperature, luminosity, mass and age in a wide range of
Galactic environments at all scales from massive YSOs in protoclusters to
entire spiral arms, providing an evolutionary sequence for the formation of
intermediate and high-mass stars. This information is essential to the
formulation of a predictive global model of the role of environment and
feedback in regulating the star-formation process. Such a model is vital to
understanding star formation on galactic scales and in the early Universe.
Hi-GAL will also provide a science legacy for decades to come with incalculable
potential for systematic and serendipitous science in a wide range of
astronomical fields, enabling the optimum use of future major facilities such

their spatial distribution and derive for each of them the expected modulation

obtained by fitting the normalizations of the model lightcurves to the observed

with the historic HEAO-1 results and falls slightly below the spectrum derived
with Swift/BAT. A 10% higher normalization of the CXB cannot be completely
excluded, but it would imply an unrealistically high albedo of the Earth. The
derived spectrum of the GRXE confirms the presence of a minimum around 80 keV
with improved statistics and yields an estimate of ~0.6 M_Sun for the average

acceleration (DSA) efficiency considering various relaxation processes of the
magnetic fluctuations in the downstream medium. Multi-wavelength radiative
signatures coming from the SNR shock wave are used in order to put to the test
the different downstream turbulence relaxation models. We confirm the result of
Parizot et al (2006) that the maximum CR energies should not go well beyond PeV
energies in young SNRs where X-ray filaments are observed. In order to match
observational data, we derive an upper limit on the magnetic field amplitude
insuring that stochastic particle reacceleration remain inefficient.
Considering then, various magnetic relaxation processes, we present two
necessary conditions to achieve efficient acceleration and X-ray filaments in
SNRs: 1/the turbulence must fulfil the inequality $2-\beta-\delta_{\rm d} \ge
0$ where $\beta$ is the turbulence spectral index while $\delta_d$ is the
relaxation length energy power-law index; 2/the typical relaxation length has
to be of the order the X-ray rim size. We identify that Alv\'enic/fast
magnetosonic mode damping does fulfil all conditions while non-linear
Kolmogorov damping does not. Confronting previous relaxation processes to
observational data, we deduct that among our SNR sample, the older ones (SN1006
& G347.3-0.5) fail to verify all conditions which means that their X-ray
filaments are likely controlled by radiative losses. The younger SNRs, Cas A,
Tycho and Kepler, do pass all tests and we infer that the downstream magnetic
field amplitude is lying in the range of 200-300 $\mu$ Gauss.

timescales. We (re-)analyze 50 VLBI observations obtained with the VLBA at 5
different frequencies (5 to 43 GHz) between 1992.73 and 2006.32. We analyze the
jet component motion in detail taking care not only to account for motion in
the radial but also in the orthogonal direction. We study the evolution of the
jet ridge line and search for correlations between radio band light curves and
the kinematic properties of the jet components. We present an alternative
kinematic scenario for jet component motion in S5 0716+714 with apparent
stationarity of jet components (with regard to their core separation) with
time. Jet components, however, do seem to move significantly non-radially with
regard to their position angle and in a direction perpendicular to the major
axis of the jet. We discuss a possible correlation between the long-term radio
flux-density variability and the kinematics. We conclude that a geometric
contribution to the origin of the long-term variability might not be
negligible. Subluminal motion has been reported for most of the TeV blazars.
Our analysis also confirms this for S5 0716+714. This result increases the
number of TeV blazars showing apparent subluminal motion to 7.

observations, and in agreement with all existing limits derived from very-high
energy gamma-ray observations. The corrected spectra are still in agreement
with simple theoretical predictions. The derived strict lower-limit EBL flux is
very close to the upper limits from gamma-ray observations. This is true for
the present day EBL but also for the diffuse flux at higher redshift. If future
detections of high redshift gamma-ray sources require a lower EBL flux than
derived here, the physics assumptions used to derive the upper limits have to
be revised. The lower-limit EBL model is not only needed for absorption
features in AGN and other gamma-ray sources but is also essential when
alternative particle processes are tested, which could prevent the high energy
gamma-rays from being absorbed. It can also be used for a quaranteed
interaction of cosmic-ray particles. The model is available online.

fact, identify the reason for this error and to derive an analytical formula
accurate at the level of 1 microarcsecond as needed for high-accuracy
astrometric projects (e.g., Gaia).
  An analytical post-post-Newtonian solution for the light propagation for both

the PPN and post-linear parameters $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$. Using
analytical upper estimates of each term we investigate which

field of molecular systematics. Many phylogenetic models are often at stake and
different approaches are used to compare them within a Bayesian framework. The
Bayes factor, defined as the ratio of the marginal likelihoods of two competing
models, plays a key role in Bayesian model selection. We focus on an
alternative estimator of the marginal likelihood whose computation is still a
challenging problem. Several computational solutions have been proposed none of
which can be considered outperforming the others simultaneously in terms of
simplicity of implementation, computational burden and precision of the
estimates. Practitioners and researchers, often led by available software, have
privileged so far the simplicity of the harmonic mean estimator (HM) and the
arithmetic mean estimator (AM). However it is known that the resulting
estimates of the Bayesian evidence in favor of one model are biased and often
inaccurate up to having an infinite variance so that the reliability of the
corresponding conclusions is doubtful. Our new implementation of the
generalized harmonic mean (GHM) idea recycles MCMC simulations from the
posterior, shares the computational simplicity of the original HM estimator,
but, unlike it, overcomes the infinite variance issue. The alternative
estimator is applied to simulated phylogenetic data and produces fully
satisfactory results outperforming those simple estimators currently provided
by most of the publicly available software.

reducing passive attacks to the problem of decoding a class of non-linear codes

  From the evidence, we conclude that smaller-key sizes are sufficient for the
NLHB protocol to achieve the same level of passive attack security as the HB
Protocol. Further, for this choice of parameters, we provide an implementation
instance for the NLHB protocol for which the Prover/Verifier complexity is
lower than the HB protocol, enabling authentication on very low-cost devices

mergers. Splitting the ETGs into galaxies that show disturbed morphologies
indicative of recent merging and those that appear relaxed, we find that ~32%
of the ETG population appears to be morphologically disturbed. While the
relaxed objects are almost entirely contained within the UV red sequence, their
morphologically disturbed counterparts dominate the scatter to blue UV colours,
regardless of luminosity. Empirically and theoretically determined major-merger
rates in the redshift range z<1 are several times too low to account for the
fraction of disturbed ETGs in our sample, suggesting that minor mergers
represent the principal mechanism driving the observed star formation activity
in our sample. The young stellar components forming in these events have ages
between 0.03 and 0.3 Myrs and typically contribute <10% of the stellar mass of
the remnant. Together with recent work which demonstrates that the structural
evolution of nearby ETGs is consistent with one or more minor mergers, our
results indicate that the overall evolution of massive ETGs may be heavily
influenced by minor merging at late epochs and highlights the need to
systematically study this process in future observational surveys.

of the Fermi surface, i.e., the Fermi surface gets hidden in a region around
the anti-nodal points, because of the opening of a pseudogap in the normal
state, arising from a partial charge localization. The high energy localized
single-particle features are a result of a segregation of the homogeneous

the local translational and rotational symmetry. The pairing in such a system

such a disk, with a gap ranging from ~5 - 50 AU, as identified by Espaillat et
al. (2007) using 1+1D radiative transfer modelling. To fit the SED, they
propose 2 possible scenarios for the inner (<5 AU) disk - optically thick or
optically thin - and one scenario for the outer disk. We use the gapped disk of
LkCa 15 as a showcase to illustrate the importance of 2D radiative transfer in
transitional disks, by showing how the vertical dust distribution in
dust-filled inner holes determines not only the radial optical depth but also
the outer disk geometry. We use MCMax, a 2D radiative transfer code with a
self-consistent vertical structure, to model the SED. We identify two possible
geometries for the inner and outer disk, that are both different from those in
Espaillat et al. (2007). An inner disk in hydrostatic equilibrium reprocesses
enough starlight to fit the near infrared flux, but also casts a shadow on the
inner rim of the outer disk. This requires the outer disk scale height to be
large enough to rise out of the shadow. An optically thin inner disk does not
cast such a shadow, and the SED can be fitted with a smaller outer disk scale
height. For the dust in the inner regions to become optically thin however, the
scale height would have to be so much larger than its hydrostatic equilibrium
value that it effectively becomes a dust shell. It is currently unclear if a
physical mechanism exists which could provide for such a configuration.

(ii) DMSO, a polar organic solvent. In case (i), it is shown by SAXS study that
the structure - namely the scattering from all chains, characterised by a
maximum (""polyelectrolyte peak""), of the aqueous hydrophobic polyelectrolyte
solutions (PSS) depends on the solvent quality through the added amount of
organic solvent THF. This dependence is more pronounced when the sulfonation
rate is low (more hydrophobic polyelectrolyte). It is proposed that when THF is
added, the chain conformation evolves from the pearl necklace shape already
reported in pure water, towards the conformation in pure water for fully
sulfonated PSS, which is string-like as also reported previously. On the
contrary, for a hydrophilic polyelectrolyte, AMAMPS, no evolution occurs with
added THF in the aqueous solution. In case (ii), it is shown directly by SANS
study that PSS can behave as a classical solvophilic polyelectrolyte when
dissolved in an organic polar solvent such as DMSO: the structure (total
scattering) as well as the form factor (single chain scattering measured by
SANS using the Zero Average Contrast method) of the PSS chains is independent
of the charge content in agreement with Manning condensation, and identical to
the one of a fully charged PSS chain in pure water, which has a classical
polyelectrolyte behaviour in the semi-dilute regime.

core of a CO WD triggers the ignition of a SN Ia. The features of the ignition
are among the few free parameters of the SN Ia explosion theory. We explore the
role for the ignition process of two different issues: firstly, the ignition is
studied in WD models coming from different accretion histories. Secondly, we
estimate how a different reaction rate for C-burning can affect the ignition.
Two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of temperature perturbations in the
WD core (""bubbles"") are performed with the FLASH code. In order to evaluate the
impact of the C-burning reaction rate on the WD model, the evolution code
FLASH_THE_TORTOISE from Lesaffre et al. (2006) is used. In different WD models
a key role is played by the different gravitational acceleration in the
progenitor's core. As a consequence, the ignition is disfavored at a large
distance from the WD center in models with a larger central density, resulting
from the evolution of initially more massive progenitors. Changes in the C
reaction rate at T < 5e8 K slightly influence the ignition density in the WD
core, while the ignition temperature is almost unaffected. Recent measurements
of new resonances in the C-burning reaction rate (Spillane et al. 2007) do not
affect the core conditions of the WD significantly. This simple analysis,
performed on the features of the temperature perturbations in the WD core,
should be extended in the framework of the state-of-the-art numerical tools for
studying the turbulent convection and ignition in the WD core. Future
measurements of the C-burning reactions cross section at low energy, though
certainly useful, are not expected to affect dramatically our current
understanding of the ignition process.

processes connected with their galactic component which pollutes the ICM with
metals, stars and dust. However, it is not clear whether the presence of
diffuse dust can play a role in clusters physics since a characterisation of
the IR properties of galaxy clusters is yet to be completely achieved. We focus
on the recent work of Giard et al. (2008) who performed a stacking analysis of
the IRAS data in the direction of several thousands of galaxy clusters,
providing a statistical characterisation of their IR luminosity and redshift
evolution. We model the IR properties of the galactic population of the
SDSS-maxBCG clusters (0.1<z<0.3) in order to check if it accounts for the
entire observed signal and to constrain the possible presence of other
components, like dust in the ICM. Starting from the optical properties of the
galaxy members, we estimate their emission in the 60 and 100 micron IRAS bands
making use of modeled SEDs of different spectral types (E/S0, Sa, Sb, Sc and
starburst). We also consider the evolution of the galactic
population/luminosity with redshift. Our results indicate that the galactic
emission, which is dominated by the contribution of star-forming galaxies, is
consistent with the observed signal. In fact, our model slightly overestimates
the observed fluxes, with the excess being concentrated in low-redshift
clusters (z <~ 0.17). This indicates that, if present, the IR emission from
intracluster dust must be very small. We obtain an upper limit on the
dust-to-gas mass ratio in the ICM of Z_d <~ 5 10^-5. The excess in luminosity
obtained at low redshift constitutes an indication that the cluster environment
is driving a process of star-formation quenching in its galaxy members.

that the masers are associated with sources of higher central mass, total

other transportation networks. In particular, most ships can be classified in
three categories: bulk dry carriers, container ships and oil tankers. These
three categories do not only differ in the ships' physical characteristics, but
also in their mobility patterns and networks. Container ships follow regularly
repeating paths whereas bulk dry carriers and oil tankers move less predictably
between ports. The network of all ship movements possesses a heavy-tailed
distribution for the connectivity of ports and for the loads transported on the
links with systematic differences between ship types. The data analyzed in this
paper improve current assumptions based on gravity models of ship movements, an

is wrong, and even by making isotropic of the metric, the optical behavior of
vacuum will remain anisotropic. Hence, we conclude that the true optical

different heliocentric angles with different levels of noise. The results show
that simulations with an imposed mixed-polarity field and Rm below the
threshold for dynamo action reproduce the observed vertical flux density, but
do not display a sufficiently high horizontal flux density. Surface dynamo
simulations at the highest Rm feasible at the moment yield a ratio of the
horizontal and vertical flux density consistent with observational results, but
the overall amplitudes are too low. Based on the properties of the local dynamo
simulations, a tentative scaling of the magnetic field strength by a factor 2 -
3 reproduces the signal observed in the internetwork regions. We find an
agreement with observations at different heliocentric angles. The mean field
strength in internetwork, implied by our analysis, is roughly 170 G at the

McCullagh (1991), Cordeiro and Vasconcellos (1999), and Paula (1992). The
practical use of the formulae is that we can derive closed-form expressions for
the second-order biases of the maximum likelihood estimators of the regression
and dispersion parameters when the information matrix has a closed-form.
Various expressions for the second-order biases are given for special models.
The formulae have advantages for numerical purposes because they require only a

estimators with two different estimators which are also bias-free to the
second-order that are based on bootstrap methods. These estimators are compared

vanishingly small value of the surface tension of quark matter, is the well
known mixed phase in which the global electric charge neutrality condition is
imposed. In turn, this produces a non-constant pressure mixed phase. In the
second case, corresponding to very large values of the surface tension, the
charge neutrality condition holds only locally. However, the existence in
protoneutron star matter of an additional globally conserved charge, the lepton

the properties of the new mixed phase and the possible effects of its formation

disks slowly tilted under the action of gravity to investigate the link between
the avalanche process and a global generalized isostaticity criterion. The
avalanche starts when the packing as a whole is still stable according to this
criterion, underlining the role of large heterogeneities in the destabilizing
process: the clusters of particles with fully mobilized contacts concentrate
local failure. We demonstrate that these clusters, at odds with the pile as a
whole, are also globally marginal with respect to generalized isostaticity.
More precisely, we observe how the condition of their stability from a local
mechanical proprety progressively builds up to the generalized isostaticity
criterion as they grow in size and eventually span the whole system when
approaching the avalanche.

the local standard of rest systemic velocity of ~32 km/s. The cloud has a
column density gradient increasing from southeast to northwest, perpendicular
to the Galactic plane, in agreement with the elongation direction of the
remnant. This systemic velocity places the cloud and SNR 3C 397 at a kinematic
distance of ~10.3 kpc. The derived mean molecular density (~10-30 cm^-3)
explains the high volume emission measure of the X-ray emitting gas. A 12CO
line broadening of the ~32 km/s component is detected at the westmost boundary
of the remnant, which provides direct evidence of the SNR-MC interaction and
suggests multi-component gas there with dense (~10^4 cm^-3) molecular clumps.
We confirm the previous detection of a MC at ~38 km/s to the west and south of
the SNR and argue, based on HI self-absorption, that the cloud is located in
the foreground of the remnant. A list of Galactic SNRs presently known and
suggested to be in physical contact with environmental MCs is appended in this

SU(4). The wave functions are specially written in a form to allow a comparison
with the approximate, customarily used wave functions, where the system is

matrix elements of the flavor operator calculated with the exact wave functions
acquire the same asymptotic form at large $N_c$, irrespective of the
spin-flavor multiplet contained in $[N_c-1,1]$, while with the approximate wave
function one cannot obtain a similar behaviour. The isoscalar factors of the
permutation group of $N_c$ particles derived here can be used in any problem
