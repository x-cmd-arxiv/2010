  equations in superspace",,,,,"nlin.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  We devise a lucid and straightforward way for explicitly constructing
quasi-periodic wave solutions (also called multi-periodic wave solutions) of
supersymmetric equations in superspace $\mathbb{R}_\Lambda^{2,1}$ over
two-dimensional Grassmann algebra $G_1(\sigma)$. Once a nonlinear equation is
written in a bilinear form, its quasi-periodic wave solutions can be directly
obtained by using a formula. Moreover, properties of these solutions are
investigated in detail by analyzing their structures, plots and asymptotic
behaviors. The relations between the quasi-periodic wave solutions and soliton
solutions are rigorously established. It is shown that the soliton solutions
can be obtained only as limiting cases of the quasi-periodic wave solutions
under small amplitude limits in superspace $\mathbb{R}_\Lambda^{2,1}$. We find
that, in contrast to the purely bosonic case, there is an interesting
influencing band occurred among the quasi-periodic waves under the presence of
the Grassmann variable. The quasi-periodic waves are symmetric about the band
but collapse along with the band. Furthermore, the amplitudes of the
quasi-periodic waves increase as the waves move away from the band. The
efficiency of our proposed method can be demonstrated on a class variety of
supersymmetric equations such as those considered in this paper,
$\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric KdV, Sawada-Kotera-Ramani and Ito's equations,
as well as $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric KdV equation.

into the theory of general relativity and may ultimately entail fundamental
physical implication in observations. However, at present, the dynamics of
critical phenomena in gravitational collapse scenarios are still largely
unknown. My thesis seeks to understand the properties of the threshold in the
solution space of the Einstein field equations between the black hole and
neutron star phases, understand the properties of the neutron star critical
solution and clarify the implication of these results on realistic
astrophysical scenarios. We develop a new set of neutron star-like initial data
to establish the universality of the neutron star critical solution and analyze
the structure of neutron star and neutron star-like critical collapses via the
study of the phase spaces. We also study the different time scales involved in
the neutron star critical solution and analyze the properties of the critical
index via comparisons between neutron star and neutron star-like initial data.
Finally, we explore the boundary of the attraction basin of the neutron star
critical solution and its transition to a known set of non-critical fixed
points.

of the motion of the Moon. The purpose of such theories was to be able to
predict the position of the Moon in the sky. These geometrical models implied a
certain range of distance of the Moon. Ptolemy's model, in fact, predicted that
the Moon was nearly twice as far away at apogee than at perigee. Measurements
of the angular size of the Moon were within the capabilities of pre-telescopic
astronomers. These could have helped refine the models of the motion of the
Moon, but hardly anyone seems to have made any measurements that have come down
to us. Using a piece of cardboard with a small hole punched in it which slides
up and down a yardstick, we show that it is possible to determine an
approximate value of the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit. From 64 observations
taken over 14 cycles of the Moon's phases we find find epsilon ~ 0.041 +/-
0.004. A typical measurement uncertainty of the Moon's angular size is +/- 0.7
arcmin. Since the Moon's angular size ranges from 29.4 to 33.5 arcmin,
carefully taken naked eye data are accurate enough to demonstrate the periodic
variations of the Moon's angular size.

from the fluid to the scalar field and the later eventually dominates.

set results in the constraint \Omega_m=0.269 \pm 0.012, \sigma_8=0.81 \pm 0.021

last constraints obtained by Mantz et al. (2008), are fundamentally due to the
tightness of the $f_{gas}$+CMB+SNIa constraints and not to their XLF analysis.

  preliminary summary of this work appeared (under the same title) in
  proceedings of the 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory",,,,"cs.DM cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-adaptive group testing involves grouping arbitrary subsets of $n$ items
into different pools. Each pool is then tested and defective items are
identified. A fundamental question involves minimizing the number of pools
required to identify at most $d$ defective items. Motivated by applications in
network tomography, sensor networks and infection propagation, a variation of
group testing problems on graphs is formulated. Unlike conventional group
testing problems, each group here must conform to the constraints imposed by a
graph. For instance, items can be associated with vertices and each pool is any
set of nodes that must be path connected. In this paper, a test is associated
with a random walk. In this context, conventional group testing corresponds to
the special case of a complete graph on $n$ vertices.
  For interesting classes of graphs a rather surprising result is obtained,
namely, that the number of tests required to identify $d$ defective items is
substantially similar to what is required in conventional group testing
problems, where no such constraints on pooling is imposed. Specifically, if
T(n) corresponds to the mixing time of the graph $G$, it is shown that with
$m=O(d^2T^2(n)\log(n/d))$ non-adaptive tests, one can identify the defective
items. Consequently, for the Erdos-Renyi random graph $G(n,p)$, as well as
expander graphs with constant spectral gap, it follows that $m=O(d^2\log^3n)$
non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify $d$ defective items. Next, a
specific scenario is considered that arises in network tomography, for which it
is shown that $m=O(d^3\log^3n)$ non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify
$d$ defective items. Noisy counterparts of the graph constrained group testing
problem are considered, for which parallel results are developed. We also
briefly discuss extensions to compressive sensing on graphs.

present assumptions, the detection of a 1 M Earth planet located between 0.8
and 1.2 AU requires an intensive monitoring (weekly or better), during several
years of low activity phasis. The temporal sampling is more crucial than the
precision of the data (assuming precisions in the range [1-10] cm/s). Cooler
spots may become a problem for such detections. Also, we anticipate that
plages, not considered in this paper, could further complicate or even
compromise the detections.

of a white dwarf. The released energy causes a radiatively-driven wind that
leads to a radially extended atmosphere around the white dwarf. Significant
blue shifts in photospheric absorption lines are found in the spectra of novae
during their SSS phase, being an evidence of continued mass loss in this phase.
We present spherically symmetric PHOENIX models that account for the expansion
of the ejecta. A comparison to a plane parallel, hydrostatic atmosphere model
demonstrates that the mass loss can have a significant impact on the model
spectra. The dynamic model yields less pronounced absorption edges, and harder
X-ray spectra are the result. Therefore, lower effective temperatures are
needed to explain the observed spectra. Although both types of models are yet
to be fine-tuned in order to accurately determine best fit parameters, the
implications on the chemical abundances are going in opposite directions. With
the expanding models the requirement for strong depletion of the crucial
elements that cause these edges is now avoidable.

flux of $2.2\times 10^{-6} {\rm W} {\rm m}^{-2}$ (GOES C2.2). The

comparison strongly favors a power-law plus rollover model for the distribution

to this small active region having a finite amount of energy. The rate of
flaring in the region varies with time, becoming very high for two days

heat flow show peaks when the Fermi energy matches with the spin-split resonant
levels localized between the DWs. The peak height of the pump current is an
indicator for the lifetime of the spin-split quasistationary states between the

in side-band formations observable in the pump current. The pump noise carries
information on the correlation properties between the nonequilibrium electrons
and the quasi-holes created by the oscillating scatterer. The ratio between the
pump shot noise and the heat flow serves as an indicator for quasi-particle

recoveries differ greatly from pulsar to pulsar and for different glitches in

post-glitch recovery on timescales of 100 -- 1000 days, but in some cases,

recoveries, permanent increases in slowdown rate are seen for the two large

show a linear increase in nudot following the partial exponential recovery,

choice of the array configuration, which affects substantially the resolution,
rms noise, sidelobe level and dynamic range achievable with the SKA. We present

  Technology",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the ergodic sum-rate and outage probability of a downlink
single-antenna channel with K users are analyzed in the presence of Rayleigh
flat fading, where limited channel state information (CSI) feedback is assumed.
Specifically, only 1-bit feedback per fading block per user is available at the
base station. We first study the ergodic sum-rate of the 1-bit feedback scheme,
and consider the impact of feedback delay on the system. A closed-form
expression for the achievable ergodic sum-rate is presented as a function of
the fading temporal correlation coefficient. It is proved that the sum-rate
scales as loglogK, which is the same scaling law achieved by the optimal
non-delayed full CSI feedback scheme. The sum-rate degradation due to outdated
CSI is also evaluated in the asymptotic regimes of either large K or low SNR.
The outage performance of the 1-bit feedback scheme for both instantaneous and
outdated feedback is then investigated. Expressions for the outage
probabilities are derived, along with the corresponding diversity-multiplexing
tradeoffs (DMT). It is shown that with instantaneous feedback, a power
allocation based on the feedback bits enables to double the DMT compared to the
case with short-term power constraint in which a dynamic power allocation is
not allowed. But, with outdated feedback, the advantage of power allocation is
lost, and the DMT reverts to that achievable with no CSI feedback.
Nevertheless, for finite SNR, improvement in terms of outage probability can
still be obtained.

telescope over 9.3 years show clear time-variations in pulse width, shape and
polarization. We interpret these variations in terms of relativistic precession
of the pulsar spin axis about the total angular momentum vector of the system.
Over the nine years, the pulse width at the 50% level has changed by more than
a factor of three. Large variations have also been observed in the 1400-MHz
mean flux density. The pulse polarization has been monitored since 2004 April
using digital filterbank systems and also shows large and systematic variations
in both linear and circular polarization. Position angle variations, both
across the pulse profile and over the data span, are complex, with major
differences between the central and outer parts of the pulse profile. Modelling
of the observed position angle variations by relativistic precession of the
pulsar spin axis shows that the spin-orbit misalignment angle is about 110 deg
and that the precessional phase has passed through 180 deg during the course of
our observations. At the start of our observations, the line-of-sight impact
parameter was about 4 deg in magnitude and it reached a minimum very close to 0
deg around early 2007, consistent with the observed pulse width variations. We
have therefore mapped approximately one half of the emission beam, showing that
it is very asymmetric with respect to the magnetic axis. The derived
precessional parameters imply that the pre-supernova star had a mass of about 2
Msun and that the supernova recoil kick velocity was relatively small. With the
reversal in the rate of change of the impact parameter, we predict that over
the next decade we will see a reversed ""replay"" of the variations observed in
the past decade.

functionals which substantially extend previously used trial bases in the

dispersion (which is taken to be analytic at zero momentum). When completed by
the perturbative Yang-Mills dispersion at high momenta, this results in a
significantly enlarged trial functional space which incorporates both dynamical
mass generation and asymptotic freedom. After casting the dynamics associated
with these wave functionals into an effective action for collections of soft
vacuum-field orbits, the leading infrared improvements manifest themselves as
four-gradient interactions. Those turn out to significantly lower the minimal
vacuum energy density, thus indicating a clear overall improvement of the
vacuum description. The dimensional transmutation mechanism and the dynamically
generated mass scale remain almost quantitatively robust, however, which
ensures that our prediction for the gluon condensate is consistent with
standard values. Further results include a finite group velocity for the soft
gluonic modes due to the higher-gradient corrections and indications for a
negative differential color resistance of the Yang-Mills vacuum.

called relative infinitesimals relative to the scale $\varepsilon$. A

estimated from the ratio of the two GOES channels is correctly predicted. The
observed fluxes of the He-like K resonance line per unit emission measure gives
log A(K) = 5.86 (on a scale log A(H) = 12), with a total range of a factor 2.9.
This is higher than photospheric abundance estimates by a factor 5.5, a
slightly greater enhancement than for other elements with first ionization

enrichment of low-FIP elements in coronal plasmas depends weakly on the value
of the FIP which for K is extremely low (4.34 eV). Our work also suggests that
fractionation of elements to form the FIP effect occurs in the low chromosphere

(T_N\approx 205 K) and superconducting (T_c\approx 25 K) transitions. It is
found that for the homogeneous sample the resistivity decreases above T_N far
faster with temperature than below it (for both directions of measuring
current, parallel and perpendicular to basal CuO_2 planes). A similar behavior
of conductivity near PM-AFM transition is also found for the phase-separated
and less resistive sample. In this case a clear kink in R(T) curve near
T_N\approx 205 K can be seen. Furthermore, a transition to metallic (dR/dT>0)
behavior occurs far enough above T_N. The observed behavior of the samples
studied is related to increased delocalization of charge carriers above T_N.

range of parameter space, we find an astonishingly good match between the
observed $L_{X}$ and the model $L_{*}$. We conclude irradiation-driven warping
is the mechanism underlying the long periods in X-ray binaries. Our Her X-1
simulation simultaneously reproduces the observed $L_{X}$, the ""main-"" and
""short-high"" X-ray states and the orbital inclination. Our simulations of SS
433 give a maximum warp angle of $18.6^{\circ}$, a good match to the cone
traced by the jets, but this angle is reached only in the outer disc. In all
cases, the overall disc tilt is less than $\degrees{13}$ and the maximum disc
warp is less than and or equal to $\degrees{21}$.

1.0-2.0kpc from us. About 170 O stars are distributed over several OB
associations, among which the Cyg OB2 cluster is by far the largest with about
100-120 O stars. As a consequence of their successive nuclear-burning episodes,
these massive stars inject large quantities of radioactive nuclei into the
interstellar medium such as 26Al and 60Fe. The gamma-ray line signal from the
latter is a solid tracer of ongoing nucleosynthesis. We want to compare the
decay emission from the Cygnus region with predictions of recently improved
stellar models. As a first step, we establish observational constraints upon
the gamma-ray line emission from 26Al and 60Fe, with particular emphasis placed
on separating the emission due to the Cygnus complex from the foreground and
background mean Galactic contributions. We used the high-resolution gamma-ray
spectrometer INTEGRAL/SPI to analyse the 26Al and 60Fe decay signal from the
Cygnus region. The weak gamma-ray line emissions at 1809 and 1173/1332keV have
been characterised in terms of photometry, spectrometry, and source morphology.
The 1809keV emission from Cygnus is centred on the position of the Cyg OB2
cluster and has a typical size of 9 degrees or more. The total 1809keV flux
from the Cygnus region is (6.0 +/- 1.0) x10e-5 ph/cm2/s, but the flux really
attributable to the Cygnus complex reduces to (3.9 +/- 1.1) x10e-5 ph/cm2/s.
The 1809keV line centroid is agrees with expectations considering the direction
and distance of the Cygnus complex, and the line width is consistent with
typical motions of the interstellar medium. No decay emission from 60Fe has
been observed from the Cygnus region and an upper limit of 1.6 x10e-5 ph/cm2/s
was derived.

radioactive nuclei into the interstellar medium, such as 26Al and 60Fe, and
their gamma-ray line decay signals can provide insight into the physics of
massive stars and core-collapse supernovae. Past studies of the nucleosynthesis
activity of Cygnus have concluded that the level of 26Al decay emission as
deduced from CGRO/COMPTEL observations was a factor 2-3 above the predictions
based on the theoretical yields available at that time and on the observed
stellar content of the Cygnus region. We reevaluate the situation from new
measurements of the gamma-ray decay fluxes with INTEGRAL/SPI and new
predictions based on recently improved stellar models including some of the
effects of stellar rotation for the higher mass stars and a coherent estimate
of the contribution from SNIb/c. We developed a population synthesis code to
predict the nucleosynthesis activity and corresponding decay fluxes of a given
stellar population of massive stars. The observed decay fluxes from the Cygnus
complex are found to be consistent with the values predicted by population
synthesis at solar metallicity. The observed extent of the 1809keV emission
from Cygnus is found to be consistent with the result of a numerical simulation
of the diffusion of 26Al inside the superbubble blown by Cyg OB2. Our work
indicates that the past dilemma regarding the gamma-ray line emission from
Cygnus resulted from an overestimate of the 1809keV flux of the Cygnus complex,
combined with an underestimate of the nucleosynthesis yields.

minimization methods increase the dimension of this cube by removing one
literal from it at a time. But there are two problems of exponential
complexity. One of them is the selection of the order in which the literals are
to be removed from the implicant at hand. The latter is the mechanism that
checks whether a tentative literal removal is acceptable. The reduced Offset
concept has been developed to avoid of these problems. This concept is based on
positional-cube representation where each cube is represented by two n-bit
strings. We show that each reduced Off-cube may be represented by a single
n-bit string and propose a set of bitwise operations to be performed on such
strings. The experiments on single-output benchmarks show that this approach
can significantly speed up the minimization process, improve the quality of its
results and reduce the amount of memory required for this aim.
