and ~1.7 mJy, respectively) observations covering the 2 square degree COSMOS
field are combined with an extensive multi-wavelength data set to study the
evolution of the IR-radio relation at intermediate and high redshift. With
~4500 sources -- of which ~30% have spectroscopic redshifts -- the current
sample is significantly larger than previous ones used for the same purpose.
Both monochromatic IR/radio flux ratios (q24 & q70), as well as the ratio of
the total IR and the 1.4 GHz luminosity (qTIR) are used as indicators for the
IR/radio properties of star forming galaxies and AGN.
  Using a sample jointly selected at IR and radio wavelengths in order to
reduce selection biases, we provide firm support for previous findings that the
IR-radio relation remains unchanged out to at least z~1.4. Moreover, based on
data from ~150 objects we also find that the local relation likely still holds
at 2.5<z<5. At redshift z<1.4 we observe that radio-quiet AGN populate the
locus of the IR-radio relation in similar numbers as star forming sources. In
our analysis we employ the methods of survival analysis in order to ensure a
statistically sound treatment of flux limits arising from non-detections. We
determine the observed shift in average IR/radio properties of IR- and radio-
selected populations and show that it can reconcile apparently discrepant
measurements presented in the literature. Finally, we also investigate
variations of the IR/radio ratio with IR and radio luminosity and find that it
hardly varies with IR luminosity but is a decreasing function of radio
luminosity.

all mechanically compatible and electrically neutral domain wall species in the
entire temperature range of ferroelectric phases. The model suggests that the
lowest energy walls in the orthorhombic phase of BaTiO3 are the 90-degree and
60-degree walls. In the rhombohedral phase, the lowest energy walls are the
71-degree and 109-degree walls. All these ferroelastic walls have thickness
below 1 nm except for the 90-degree wall in the tetragonal phase and the
60-degree S-wall in the orthorhombic phase, for which the larger thickness of
the order of 5 nm was found. The antiparallel walls of the rhombohedral phase
have largest energy and thus they are unlikely to occur. The calculation
indicates that the lowest energy structure of the 109-degree wall and few other
domain walls in the orthorhombic and rhombohedral phases resemble Bloch-like
walls known from magnetism.

represented by an eigenstrain in the lattice elements forming the interface.
The lattice modelling approach is applied to the analysis of corrosion induced

context-free grammar that generates the string, is a simple and powerful
paradigm that captures many popular compression schemes. In this paper, we
present a novel grammar representation that allows efficient random access to
any character or substring without decompressing the string.
  Let $S$ be a string of length $N$ compressed into a context-free grammar
$\mathcal{S}$ of size $n$. We present two representations of $\mathcal{S}$
achieving $O(\log N)$ random access time, and either $O(n\cdot \alpha_k(n))$
construction time and space on the pointer machine model, or $O(n)$
construction time and space on the RAM. Here, $\alpha_k(n)$ is the inverse of
the $k^{th}$ row of Ackermann's function. Our representations also efficiently
support decompression of any substring in $S$: we can decompress any substring
of length $m$ in the same complexity as a single random access query and
additional $O(m)$ time. Combining these results with fast algorithms for
uncompressed approximate string matching leads to several efficient algorithms
for approximate string matching on grammar-compressed strings without
decompression. For instance, we can find all approximate occurrences of a
pattern $P$ with at most $k$ errors in time $O(n(\min\{|P|k, k^4 + |P|\} + \log
N) + occ)$, where $occ$ is the number of occurrences of $P$ in $S$. Finally, we
generalize our results to navigation and other operations on grammar-compressed
ordered trees.
  All of the above bounds significantly improve the currently best known
results. To achieve these bounds, we introduce several new techniques and data
structures of independent interest, including a predecessor data structure, two
""biased"" weighted ancestor data structures, and a compact representation of
heavy paths in grammars.

in statistical physics. The focus of this paper is its dynamic (stochastic)
version, the Glauber dynamics, introduced in 1963 and by now the most popular
means of sampling the Ising measure. Intensive study throughout the last three
decades has yielded a rigorous understanding of the spectral-gap of the
dynamics on $\Z^2$ everywhere except at criticality. While the critical
behavior of the Ising model has long been the focus for physicists,
mathematicians have only recently developed an understanding of its critical
geometry with the advent of SLE, CLE and new tools to study conformally
invariant systems.
  A rich interplay exists between the static and dynamic models. At the static
phase-transition for Ising, the dynamics is conjectured to undergo a critical
slowdown: At high temperature the inverse-gap is O(1), at the critical
$\beta_c$ it is polynomial in the side-length and at low temperature it is
exponential in it. A seminal series of papers verified this on $\Z^2$ except at
$\beta=\beta_c$ where the behavior remained a challenging open problem.
  Here we establish the first rigorous polynomial upper bound for the critical
mixing, thus confirming the critical slowdown for the Ising model in $\Z^2$.
Namely, we show that on a finite box with arbitrary (e.g. fixed, free,
periodic) boundary conditions, the inverse-gap at $\beta=\beta_c$ is polynomial
in the side-length. The proof harnesses recent understanding of the scaling

dual Banach algebras. We provide a simple criterion for when a multiplier

algebra of the convolution algebra of a locally compact quantum group is always
a dual Banach algebra. We also study this problem within the framework of
abstract Pontryagin duality, and show that we construct the same

cellular pathways are highly cooperative, often requiring the joint effect of

define the concept of dependence among multiple variables using maximum entropy

Langmuir waves (LWs) and ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) in an unmagnetized plasma.
The effects of dispersion due to charge separation and the density nonlinearity
associated with the IAWs, are considered to modify the properties of Langmuir
solitons, as well as to model the dynamics of relatively large amplitude wave
envelopes. It is found that the Langmuir wave electric field, indeed, increases
by the effect of ion-wave nonlinearity (IWN). Use of a low-dimensional model,
based on three Fourier modes shows that a transition to temporal chaos is
possible, when the length scale of the linearly excited modes is larger than
that of the most unstable ones. The chaotic behaviors of the unstable modes are
identified by the analysis of Lyapunov exponent spectra. The space-time
evolution of the coupled LWs and IAWs shows that the IWN can cause the
excitation of many unstable harmonic modes, and can lead to strong IAW
emission. This occurs when the initial wave field is relatively large or the
length scale of IAWs is larger than the soliton characteristic size. Numerical
simulation also reveals that many solitary patterns can be excited and
generated through the modulational instability (MI) of unstable harmonic modes.
As time goes on, these solitons are seen to appear in the spatially partial
coherence (SPC) state due to the free ion-acoustic radiation as well as in the
state of spatiotemporal chaos (STC) due to collision and fusion in the
stochastic motion. The latter results the redistribution of initial wave energy
into a few modes with small length scales, which may lead to the onset of
Langmuir turbulence in laboratory as well as space plasmas.

the large width of the QGP bags explains not only the observed deficit in the

bags cannot be directly observed even as metastable states in a hadronic phase.
Also the Regge trajectories of large and heavy QGP bags are established both in
a vacuum and in a strongly interacting medium. It is shown that at high
temperatures the average mass and width of the QGP bags behave in accordance
with the upper bound of the Regge trajectory asymptotics (the linear
asymptotics), whereas for temperatures below T_H/2 (T_H is the Hagedorn
temperature) they obey the lower bound of the Regge trajectory asymptotics (the
square root one). Thus, for T < T_H/2 the spin of the QGP bags is restricted
from above, whereas for T> T_H/2 these bags demonstrate the standard Regge
behavior consistent with the string models.

the Sun's Dark Matter content, assumed somehow accumulated during last 4.5 Gyr,
would have displaced the planets faraway by about 10^-2-10^1 au 4.5 Gyr ago.
Another consequence is that the semimajor axis of the Earth's orbit,
approximately equal to the Astronomical Unit, would undergo a secular increase
of 0.02-0.05 m yr^-1, in agreement with the latest observational determinations
of the Astronomical Unit secular increase of 0.07 +/- 0.02 m yr^-1 and 0.05 m

next billions year at the same rate as in the past, the orbits of its planets
will shrink by about 10^-1-10^1 au (\approx 0.2-0.5 au for the Earth), with
consequences for their fate, especially of the inner planets. On the other
hand, lunar and planetary ephemerides set upper bounds on the secular variation
of the Sun's gravitational parameter GM which are one one order of magnitude
smaller than 10^-12 yr^-1. Dark Matter accretion on planets has, instead, less
relevant consequences for their satellites. Indeed, 4.5 Gyr ago their orbits

resonant frequencies in their spectral function. We model the coupling of the
qubit to its environment via the Caldeira-Leggett formulation of quantum
dissipation/coherence, and study the simplest example of decoherence effects in
circuits with resonances such as a dc SQUID phase qubit in the presence of an
isolation circuit, which is designed to enhance the coherence time. We
emphasize that the spectral density of the environment is strongly dependent on
the circuit design, and can be engineered to produce longer decoherence times.
We begin with a general discussion of superconducting qubits such as the flux
qubit, the Cooper pair box and the phase qubit and show that in these kinds of
systems appropriate circuit design can greatly modify the spectral density of
the environment and lead to enhancement of decoherence times. In the particular
case of the phase qubit, for instance, we show that when the frequency of the
qubit is at least two times larger than the resonance frequency of the
environmental spectral density, the decoherence time of the qubit is a few
orders of magnitude larger than that of the typical ohmic regime, where the
frequency of the qubit is much smaller than the resonance frequency of the
spectral density. In addition, we demonstrate that the environment does not
only affect the decoherence time, but also the frequency of the transition
itself, which is shifted from its environment-free value. Second, we show that
when the qubit frequency is nearly the same as the resonant frequency of the
environmental spectral density, an oscillatory non-Markovian decay emerges, as
the qubit and its environment self-generate Rabi oscillations of characteristic
time scales shorter than the decoherence time.

larger or smaller than the sound gyroradius $\rho_s$. The reconnection is slow
or Sweet-Parker-like for $\delta \gtrsim \rho_s$, and fast otherwise. In the

proportional to $Ha^{-1}$ with $Ha \propto 1/\sqrt{\eta \mu}$ the Hartmann
number, and the reconnection rate is proportional to $Pr^{-1/2}$ with $Pr =

matter phase we use an $SU(3)_f$ Nambu-Jona-Lasinio effective model which

during the transition in such a way that just deconfined quark matter is
transitorily out of equilibrium with respect to weak interactions. We find that
deconfinement is more difficult for small neutrino content and it is easier for
lower temperatures although these effects are not too large. In addition they
will tend to cancel each other as the protoneutron star cools and deleptonizes,
resulting a transition density that is roughly constant along the evolution of
the protoneutron star. According to these results the deconfinement transition
is favored after substantial cooling and contraction of the protoneutron star.

disclosed by investigating the state of material systems such as thermodynamic

others. These concepts play a same role in mathematical physics. They are
quantities that specify a state of material systems and also characteristics of
physical fields. The duality of these concepts reveals in the fact that they
can at once be both functionals and state functions or potentials. As
functionals they are defined on nonintegrable manifold (for example, on tangent
one), and as a state function they are defined on integrable manifold (for
example, on cotangent one). The transition from functionals to state functions
dicribes the mechanism of physical structure origination. The properties of
these concepts can be studied by the example of entropy and action. The role of
these concepts in mathematical physics and field theory will be demonstrated.
  Such results have been obtained by using skew-symmetric forms. In addition to
exterior forms, the skew-symmetric forms, which are obtained from differential
equations and, in distinction to exterior forms, are evolutionary ones and are

density of a given arrangement. The absolute smallest value is two radii
because the spheres can not be closer to each other than their diameter. The
absolute densest arrangement of two, three and four spheres is defined, which
gives the absolute highest density in one, two and three dimensions. The
absolute highest density of equal spheres in three dimensions is the
tetrahedron formed by the centers of four spheres touching each other with
density of 0.7796. The density of this tetrahedron unit can be maintained only
locally because the tetrahedron units can not be expanded to form a tightly
packed arrangement in three dimensions. The maximum number of tetrahedron units
that one sphere is able to accommodate is twenty which corresponds to the
density of 0.684. The only compatible formation of equal spheres which can be
mixed with tetrahedron is octahedron. In order to mix the tetrahedron and
octahedron units certain geometrical constrains must be satisfied. It is shown
that the only possible mixture of tetrahedrons and octahedrons units is the one
which accommodates eight tetrahedron and six octahedron vertexes which is
identical to FCC and an alternative proof for the Kepler conjecture. It is
suggested that there is a density gap between the FCC density and the highest
density of disordered arrangements and that the icosahedrons configuration with
its 0.684 density represents the upper bound on the disordered arrangements.

Measurement Calculus (DMC), an assembly language for distributed

properties that are crucial to the practical usability of our language, such as
equivalence of our semantics, as well as compositionality and context-freeness
of DMC programs. We show how to put these properties to use by constructing a
composite program that implements distributed controlled operations, in the
knowledge that the semantics of this program does not change under the various
composition operations. Our formal model is the basis of a quantum virtual
machine construction for distributed quantum computations, which we elaborate
upon in the latter part of this work. This virtual machine embodies the formal
semantics of DMC such that programming execution no longer needs to be analysed
by hand. Far from a literal translation, it requires a substantial
concretisation of the formal model at the level of data structures, naming
conventions and abstraction mechanisms. At the same time we provide
automatisation techniques for program specification where possible to obtain an
expressive and user-friendly programming environment.

measured by WMAP have been suggested as possible evidence of breakdown of
statistical isotropy(SI). Most CMB photons free-stream to the present from the
surface of last scattering. It is thus reasonable to expect statistical
isotropy violation in the CMB photon distribution observed now to have
originated from SI violation in the baryon-photon fluid at last scattering, in
addition to anisotropy of the primordial power spectrum studied earlier in
literature.
  We consider the generalized anisotropic brightness distribution fluctuations,
$\Delta(\vec{k}, \hat{n}, \tau)$ (at conformal time $\tau$) in contrast to the
SI case where it is simply a function of $|\vec{k}|$ and $\hat{k} \cdot
\hat{n}$. The brightness fluctuations expanded in Bipolar Spherical Harmonic
(BipoSH) series, can then be written as $\Delta_{\ell_1 \ell_2}^{L M}(\vec{k},
\tau)$ where $L > 0$ terms encode deviations from statistical isotropy. We
study the evolution of $\Delta_{\ell_1 \ell_2}^{L M}(\vec{k}, \tau)$ from
non-zero terms $\Delta_{\ell_3 \ell_4}^{L M}(\vec{k}, \tau_s)$ at last
scattering. Similar to the SI case, power at small spherical harmonic (SH)
multipoles of $\Delta_{\ell_3 \ell_4}^{L M}(\vec{k},\tau_s)$ at the last
scattering, is transferred to $\Delta_{\ell_1 \ell_2}^{L M}(\vec{k}, \tau)$ at
larger SH multipoles. The structural similarity is more apparent in the
asymptotic expression for large values of the final SH multipoles. This
formalism allows an elegant identification of any SI violation observed today
to a possible origin in the SI violation present in the baryon-photon fluid
(eg., due to the presence of significant magnetic field).

Researchers have rarely found quantum channels with a tractable classical or

understanding of that channel's capabilities for transmitting classical or
quantum information. Here, we show that the three-dimensional capacity region
for entanglement-assisted transmission of classical and quantum information is

include generalized dephasing channels, cloning channels, and the Unruh
channel. The generalized dephasing channels and the cloning channels are
natural processes that occur in quantum systems through the loss of quantum
coherence or stimulated emission, respectively. The Unruh channel is a noisy
process that occurs in relativistic quantum information theory as a result of
the Unruh effect and bears a strong relationship to the cloning channels. We
give exact formulas for the entanglement-assisted classical and quantum
communication capacity regions of these channels. The coding strategy for each

post-processing the star formation histories of galaxies from cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations that reproduce observations of star-forming galaxies
reasonably well. We consider recipes for quenching based on major mergers, halo
mass thresholds, gas temperature thresholds, and variants thereof. We compare
the resulting simulated star formation histories to observed g-r
colour-magnitude diagrams and red and blue luminosity functions from SDSS. The
merger and halo mass quenching scenarios each yield a distinct red sequence and
blue cloud of galaxies that are in broad agreement with data, albeit only under
rather extreme assumptions. In detail, however, the simulated red sequence
slope and amplitude in each scenario is somewhat discrepant, perhaps traceable
to low metallicities in simulated galaxies. Merger quenching produces more
massive blue galaxies, earlier quenching, and more frosting of young stars;
comparing to relevant data tends to favor merger over halo mass quenching.
Although physically-motivated quenching models can produce a red sequence,
interesting generic discrepancies remain that indicate that additional physics
is required to reproduce the star formation and enrichment histories of red and
dead galaxies.

> 10^10.5 Msun disk galaxies at 0.2 < z < 0.6 in the COSMOS field. The fraction
of barred disks strongly depends on mass, disk morphology, and specific star
formation rate (SSFR). At intermediate stellar mass (10^10.5 < M < 10^11 Msun)
the bar fraction in early-type disks is much higher, at all redshifts, by a
factor ~2, than that in late-type disks. This trend is reversed at higher
stellar mass (M > 10^11 Msun), where the fraction of bars in early-type disks
becomes significantly lower, at all redshifts, than that in late-type disks.
The bar fractions for galaxies with low and high SSFRs closely follow those of
the morphologically-selected early-type and late-type populations,
respectively. This indicates a close correspondence between morphology and SSFR
in disk galaxies at these earlier epochs. Interestingly, the total bar fraction
in 10^10.5 < M < 10^11 Msun disks is built up by a factor of ~2 over the
redshift interval explored, while for M > 10^11 Msun disks it remains roughly
constant. This indicates that, already by z ~ 0.6, spectral and morphological
transformations in the most massive disk galaxies have largely converged to the
familiar Hubble sequence that we observe in the local Universe, while for
intermediate mass disks this convergence is ongoing until at least z ~ 0.2.
Moreover, these results highlight the importance of employing mass-limited
samples for quantifying the evolution of barred galaxies. Finally, the
evolution of the barred galaxy populations investigated does not depend on the
large-scale environmental density (at least, on the scales which can be probed
with the available photometric redshifts).

studying the high-redshift universe. However, inferences about galaxy
population properties are in practice limited by 'cosmic variance'. This is the
uncertainty in observational estimates of the number density of galaxies
arising from the underlying large-scale density fluctuations. This source of
uncertainty can be significant, especially for surveys which cover only small
areas and for massive high-redshift galaxies. Cosmic variance for a given
galaxy population can be determined using predictions from cold dark matter
theory and the galaxy bias. In this paper we provide tools for experiment
design and interpretation. For a given survey geometry we present the cosmic
variance of dark matter as a function of mean redshift z and redshift bin size
Dz. Using a halo occupation model to predict galaxy clustering, we derive the
galaxy bias as a function of mean redshift for galaxy samples of a given
stellar mass range. In the linear regime, the cosmic variance of these galaxy
samples is the product of the galaxy bias and the dark matter cosmic variance.
We present a simple recipe using a fitting function to compute cosmic variance
as a function of the angular dimensions of the field, z, Dz and stellar mass
m*. We also provide tabulated values and a software tool. We find that for
GOODS at z=2 and with Dz=0.5 the relative cosmic variance of galaxies with
m*>10^11 Msun is ~38%, while it is ~27% for GEMS and ~12% for COSMOS. For
galaxies of m*~10^10 Msun the relative cosmic variance is ~19% for GOODS, ~13%
for GEMS and ~6% for COSMOS. This implies that cosmic variance is a significant
source of uncertainty at z=2 for small fields and massive galaxies, while for
larger fields and intermediate mass galaxies cosmic variance is less serious.

the sky by 21 kpc in a disturbed host galaxy merger showing obvious tidal
tails. The pair was targeted as part of a complete sample of binary quasar
candidates with small transverse separations drawn from SDSS DR6 photometry. We
present follow-up optical imaging which shows broad, symmetrical tidal arm
features spanning some 75 kpc at the quasars' redshift. Numerical modeling
suggests that the system consists of two massive disk galaxies prograde to
their mutual orbit, caught during the first passage of an active merger. This
demonstrates rapid black hole growth during the early stages of a merger
between galaxies with pre-existing bulges. Neither of the two luminous nuclei
show significant instrinsic absorption by gas or dust in our optical or X-ray
observations, illustrating that not all merging quasars will be in an obscured,

B is rather normal, while for the A component L/LEdd is quite (>3sigma) high

particularly via the effect of gravitational lensing. Evidence from many
different directions now all imply that five sixths of the material content of
the universe is in this mysterious form, separate from and beyond the ordinary
""baryonic"" particles in the standard model of particle physics. Dark matter
appears not to interact via the electromagnetic force, and therefore neither
emits nor reflects light. However, it definitely does interact via gravity, and
has played the most important role in shaping the Universe on large scales. The
most successful technique with which to investigate it has so far been the
effect of gravitational lensing. The curvature of space-time near any
gravitating mass (including dark matter) deflects passing rays of light -
observably shifting, distorting and magnifying the images of background
galaxies. Measurements of such effects currently provide constraints on the
mean density of dark matter, and its density relative to baryonic matter; the
size and mass of individual dark matter particles; and its cross section under
various fundamental forces.

this globular cluster population is known to be associated with the bulges /

bulges and thick disks from super star-forming clumps at high redshift.
Finally, with the assumption that star formation in these clumps proceeds as a
scaled-up version of local star formation in molecular clouds, this formation
scenario reproduces the observed numbers and mass spectra of metal-rich
globular clusters. The resulting link between the turbulent and clumpy disks
observed in high-redshift galaxies and a local globular cluster population
provides a plausible co-evolutionary scenario for several of the major
components of a galaxy: the bulge, the thick disk, and one of the globular
cluster populations.

follows: when the particle visits a site for the first time, it has a
uniformly-positive drift in a given direction $\ell$; when the particle is at a

ellipticity and that the jumps of the process are uniformly bounded, we prove
that the process is ballistic in the direction $\ell$ so that
$\liminf_{n\to\infty}\frac{X_n\cdot \ell}{n}>0$. A key ingredient in the proof
of this result is an estimate on the probability that the process visits less

positive number depending on the parameters of the model. This approach
completely avoids the use of tan points and coupling methods specific to the

centres, due to the gravitational radiation recoil, along the cosmic merger
history of the MBH population. We discuss the 'danger' of the recoil for MBHs
as a function of different MBH spin/orbit configurations and of the host halo
cosmic bias, and on how that reflects on the 'occupation fraction' of MBHs. We
assess ejection probabilities for mergers occurring in a gas-poor environment,
where the MBH binary coalescence is driven by stellar dynamical processes, and
the spin/orbit configuration is expected to be isotropically distributed. We
contrast this case with the 'aligned' case. The latter is the most realistic
situation for 'wet', gas-rich mergers, which are the expectation for
high-redshift galaxies. We find that if all halos at z>5-7 host a MBH, the
probability of the Milky Way (or similar size galaxy) to host a MBH today is
less than 50%, unless MBHs form continuously in galaxies. The 'occupation
fraction' of MBHs, intimately related to halo bias and MBH formation
efficiency, plays a crucial role in increasing the retention fraction. Small
halos, with shallow potential wells and low escape velocities, have a high
ejection probability, but the MBH merger rate is very low along their galaxy
formation merger hierarchy: MBH formation processes are likely inefficient in
such shallow potential wells. Recoils can decrease the overall frequency of
MBHs in small galaxies to ~60%, while they have little effect on the frequency
of MBHs in large galaxies (at most a 20% effect).

with inclination which imply a total extinction from face-on to edge-on of 0.7,
0.6, 0.5 and 0.4 magnitudes for the ugri passbands. We split the sample into
""bulgy"" (early-type) and ""disky"" (late-type) spirals using the SDSS fracdeV (or
f_DeV) parameter and show that the average face-on colour of ""bulgy"" spirals is
redder than the average edge-on colour of ""disky"" spirals. This shows that the
observed optical colour of a spiral galaxy is determined almost equally by the
spiral type (via the bulge-disk ratio and stellar populations), and reddening
due to dust. We find that both luminosity and spiral type affect the total
amount of extinction, with ""disky"" spirals at M_r ~ -21.5 mags having the most
reddening. This decrease of reddening for the most luminous spirals has not
been observed before and may be related to their lower levels of recent star
formation. We compare our results with the latest dust attenuation models of
Tuffs et al. We find that the model reproduces the observed trends reasonably
well but overpredicts the amount of u-band attenuation in edge-on galaxies. We
end by discussing the effects of dust on large galaxy surveys and emphasize
that these effects will become important as we push to higher precision
measurements of galaxy properties and their clustering.

active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet propagation in realistic models of magnetized

between jets and the intracluster medium (ICM) to help clarify what role such
flows could have in the reheating of cluster cores. Our simulated jets feature
a range of intermittency behaviors, including intermittent jets that
periodically switch on and off and one model jet that shuts down completely,
naturally creating a relic plume. The ICM into which these jets propagate
incorporates tangled magnetic field geometries and density substructure
designed to mimic some likely features of real galaxy clusters. We find that
our jets are characteristically at least 60% efficient at transferring thermal
energy to the ICM. Irreversible heat energy is not uniformly distributed,
however, instead residing preferentially in regions very near the jet/cocoon
boundaries. While intermittency affects the details of how, when, and where
this energy is deposited, all of our models generically fail to heat the
cluster cores uniformly. Both the detailed density structure and nominally weak
magnetic fields in the ICM play interesting roles in perturbing the flows,
particularly when the jets are non-steady. Still, this perturbation is never
sufficient to isotropize the jet energy deposition, suggesting that some other
ingredient is required for AGN jets to successfully reheat cluster cores.

previous HST imaging. In this paper we examine how properties such as the
colour magnitude relation, structure and morphology are affected by environment
for the lowest mass galaxies. Dwarf galaxies are excellent tracers of the
effects of environment due to their low masses, allowing us to derive their
environmentally based evolution, which is more subtle in more massive galaxies.
We identify 11 dwarf elliptical (dE) and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies in
the outer regions of Perseus, all of which are previously unstudied. We measure
the (V-I)_0 colours of our newly discovered dEs, and find that these dwarfs lie
on the same red sequence as those in the cluster core. The morphologies of
these dwarfs are examined by quantifying their light distributions using CAS
parameters, and we find that dEs in the cluster outskirts are on average more
disturbed than those in the core, with <A> =0.13\pm0.09 and <S> =0.18\pm0.08,
compared to <A> =0.02\pm0.04, <S> =0.01\pm0.07 for those in the core. Based on
these results, we infer that these objects are ``transition dwarfs'', likely in
the process of transforming from late-type to early type galaxies as they
infall into the cluster, with their colours transforming before their
structures. When we compare the number counts for both the core and outer
regions of the cluster, we find that below M_V = -12, the counts in the outer
regions of the cluster exceed those in the core. This is evidence that in the
very dense region of the cluster, dwarfs are unable to survive unless they are
sufficiently massive to prevent their disruption by the cluster potential and

uniformly selected from the SDSS spectroscopic and GALEX imaging surveys. The
galaxies are observed until detected or until a low gas mass fraction limit
(1.5-5%) is reached. We present initial results based on the first Data
Release, which consists of ~20% of the final GASS sample. We use this data set
to explore the main scaling relations of HI gas fraction with galaxy structure
and NUV-r colour, and show our best fit plane describing the relation between
gas fraction, stellar mass surface density and NUV-r colour. Interesting
outliers from this plane include gas-rich red sequence galaxies that may be in
the process of regrowing their disks, as well as blue, but gas-poor spirals.

studied (m is the twisted mass scale). We found three distinct phases and two
phase transitions on the m plane. Two phases with the spontaneously broken
Z_N-symmetry are separated by a phase with unbroken Z_N. This latter phase is
characterized by a unique vacuum and confinement of all U(1) charged fields
(""quarks""). In the broken phases (one of them is at strong coupling) there are
N degenerate vacua and no confinement, similarly to the situation in the

stable existence of the liquid phase of matter in the solid region of its bulk
phase diagram. Here we develop a theoretical description of the premelting of
water ice contained in a porous matrix, made of a material with a melting
temperature substantially larger than ice itself, to predict the amount of
liquid water in the matrix at temperatures below its bulk freezing point. Our
theory combines the interfacial premelting of ice in contact with the matrix,
grain boundary melting in the ice, and impurity and curvature induced
premelting, the latter occurring in regions which force the ice-liquid
interface into a high curvature configuration. These regions are typically
found at points where the matrix surface is concave, along contact lines of a
grain boundary with the matrix, and in liquid veins. Both interfacial
premelting and curvature induced premelting depend on the concentration of
impurities in the liquid, which, due to the small segregation coefficient of
impurities in ice are treated as homogeneously distributed in the premelted
liquid. Our principal result is an equation for the fraction of liquid in the
porous medium as a function of the undercooling, which embodies the combined
effects of interfacial premelting, curvature induced premelting, and
impurities. The result is analyzed in detail and applied to a range of
experimentally relevant settings.

  Direct 3D reduced MHD simulations are presented. They model the heating of
coronal loops in the solar atmosphere via the tangling of coronal field lines
by photospheric footpoints motions within the framework of the ""Parker
scenario"". We have derived scalings of physical quantities with loop length,
and the ratio of photospheric to coronal Alfven velocities. The development of
a turbulent dynamics makes the dissipation rate independent of the Reynolds
number. The dynamics in physical space are desribed by weak turbulence, which
develops when an MHD system is embedded in a strong axial magnetic field.
  The slow wind originates in and around the coronal streamer belt. The LASCO
instrument onboard the SOHO spacecraft has observed plasma density enhancements
forming beyond the cusp of a helmet streamer. Previous theoretical models for
the formation and initial motion of these density enhancements are improved.
  The average expansion suffered by a parcel of plasma propagating outward, and
the diamagnetic force due to the overall magnetic field radial gradients are
now included. It is found that the magnetized wake configuration is resistively
unstable, that an outward accelerating magnetic island develops at the center
of the streamer, and that density enhancements occur within the magnetic
islands. The values of the acceleration and density contrasts can be in good
agreement with LASCO observations, provided the spherical divergence of the
magnetic lines starts beyond a critical distance from the Sun. This result
provides a constraint on the topology of the magnetic field.

Convergence, certain finite convergence and $q$-linear convergence results are
established, which indicate that the asymptotic convergence speed of the
proposed algorithm depends on the spectral radii of certain submatrix.
Moreover, to speed up convergence and enhance robustness, we suggest an
accelerated scheme based on an inexact alternating direction method. We present
experimental results to compare with an existing algorithm, which indicate that
the proposed algorithm is stable, efficient and competitive with TwIST

ages of 50-600 Myr according to their space motion. From the total velocity
dispersion of the 43 L dwarfs, we calculate a kinematic age of ~5 Gyr for our

dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. We find that the distributions of the U and
V velocity components of our sample are clearly non-Gaussian, placing the age
estimate inferred from the full space motion vector into question. The
W-component exhibits a distribution more consistent with a normal distribution,
and from W alone we derive an age of ~3 Gyr, which is the same age found for
late-M dwarf samples. Our brightness-limited sample is probably contaminated by
a number of outliers that predominantly bias the U and V velocity components.
The origin of the outliers remain unclear, but we suggest that these brown

stars of omega Centauri and NGC 2808 is investigated. We suggest that helium
enhancement was caused by the inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis. Regions
with extremely high baryon-to-photon ratios are assumed to be caused by the
baryogenesis. Its mass scale is also assumed to be 10^6 Msun. An example of the
mechanisms to realize these two things was already proposed as the Affleck-Dine
baryogenesis. As the baryon-to-photon ratio becomes larger, the primordial
helium abundance is enhanced. We calculated the big bang nucleosynthesis and
found that there exists a parameter region yielding enough helium to account
for the split of the main sequence in the aforementioned globular clusters
while keeping the abundances of other elements compatible with observations.
Our mechanism predicts that heavy elements with the mass number of around 100
is enhanced in the blue main sequence stars. We estimate the timescales of
diffusion of the enhanced helium and mass accretion in several stages after the
nucleosynthesis to investigate whether these processes diminish the enhancement
of helium. We found that the diffusion does not influence the helium content. A
cloud with a sufficiently large baryon-to-photon ratio to account for the
multiple main sequence collapsed immediately after the recombination.
Subsequently, the cloud accreted the ambient matter with the normal helium
content. If the star formation occurred both in the collapsed core and the
accreted envelope, then the resultant star cluster has a double main sequence.

below by a positive constant if the identified region is assumed to have a

Ly$\alpha$ emission is mainly contributed by photons which are scattered only
once. The flux is of order $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-9}$ relative to the undecayed
maximum flux of the transmitted continuum, making the feature negligible but
potentially observable. If not obscured by host galaxy's DLA or intergalactic
neutral hydrogen, the feature may appear sometime from one hour to several
years when the directly transmitted light has faded away.This scattered

  to Networks",,"10.1109/TIT.2010.2095072",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional LDPC ensembles, introduced by Felstrom and Zigangirov, have
excellent thresholds and these thresholds are rapidly increasing as a function
of the average degree. Several variations on the basic theme have been proposed
to date, all of which share the good performance characteristics of
convolutional LDPC ensembles. We describe the fundamental mechanism which
explains why ""convolutional-like"" or ""spatially coupled"" codes perform so well.
In essence, the spatial coupling of the individual code structure has the
effect of increasing the belief-propagation (BP) threshold of the new ensemble
to its maximum possible value, namely the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) threshold
of the underlying ensemble. For this reason we call this phenomenon ""threshold
saturation."" This gives an entirely new way of approaching capacity. One
significant advantage of such a construction is that one can create
capacity-approaching ensembles with an error correcting radius which is
increasing in the blocklength. Our proof makes use of the area theorem of the
BP-EXIT curve and the connection between the MAP and BP threshold recently
pointed out by Measson, Montanari, Richardson, and Urbanke. Although we prove
the connection between the MAP and the BP threshold only for a very specific
ensemble and only for the binary erasure channel, empirically a threshold
saturation phenomenon occurs for a wide class of ensembles and channels. More
generally, we conjecture that for a large range of graphical systems a similar
saturation of the ""dynamical"" threshold occurs once individual components are
coupled sufficiently strongly. This might give rise to improved algorithms as
well as to new techniques for analysis.

hypothesis: the current version of quantum mechanics leaves open what happens
to systems when they change their separation status. New rules that close this
gap can therefore be added without disturbing the logic of quantum mechanics.
The second working hypothesis is that registration apparatuses for microsystems
must contain detectors and that their readings are signals from detectors. This
implies that separation status of a microsystem changes during both preparation
and registration. A new rule that specifies what happens at these changes and
that guarantees the objectification is formulated and discussed. A part of our

the Duffing oscillator differed significantly and that in the classical limit
entanglement was preserved only in the chaotic-like solutions. However, Duffing
oscillators are a highly idealised toy system. Motivated by a wish to explore
more experimentally realisable systems we extended our work in [2,3] to an
analysis of SQUID rings. In [3] we showed that the two systems share a common
feature. That is, when the SQUID ring's trajectories appear to follow (semi)
classical orbits entanglement persists. Our analysis in[3] was restricted to
the quantum state diffusion unravelling of the master equation - representing
unit efficiency heterodyne detection (or ambi-quadrature homodyne detection).
Here we show that very similar behaviour occurs using the quantum jumps
unravelling of the master equation. Quantum jumps represents a discontinuous
photon counting measurement process. Hence, the results presented here imply
that such persistent entanglement is independent of measurement process and

nucleation rate of carbon dioxide is generally underestimated by CNT, leading
to a deviation between one and two orders of magnitude for pure carbon dioxide
in the vicinity of the spinodal line and up to three orders of magnitude in
presence of air as a carrier gas. Furthermore, CNT predicts a temperature
dependence of the nucleation rate in the spinodal limit, which cannot be

by an infinite series of lag-covariances, and therefore, studentizing factors

increasing number, say, $\ell$ of lag-covariance estimators, which are
themselves quadratic functions of the observations. The unboundedness of the

mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopic study of the nuclei and star-forming regions
of 4 local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) using T-ReCS on the Gemini South
telescope. We investigate the spatial variations of the features seen in the
N-band spectra of LIRGs on scales of ~100 pc, which allow us to separate the
AGN emission from that of the star formation (SF). We compare our Gemini T-ReCS
nuclear and integrated spectra of LIRGs with those obtained with Spitzer IRS.
The 9.7um silicate absorption feature is weaker in the nuclei of the LIRGs than
in the surrounding regions. This is probably due to the either clumpy or
compact environment of the central AGN or young, nuclear starburst. We find
that the [NeII] luminosity surface density is tightly and directly correlated
with that of Pa-alpha for the LIRG star-forming regions (slope of 1.00+-0.02).
Although the 11.3um PAH feature shows also a trend with Pa-alpha, this is not
common for all the regions. We also find that the [NeII]\Pa-alpha ratio does
not depend on the Pa-alpha equivalent width (EW), i.e., on the age of the
ionizing stellar populations, suggesting that, on the scales probed here, the
[NeII] emission line is a good tracer of the SF activity in LIRGs. On the other
hand, the 11.3um PAH\Pa-alpha ratio increases for smaller values of the
Pa-alpha EW (increasing ages), indicating that the 11.3um PAH feature can also
be excited by older stars than those responsible for the Pa-alpha emission.
Additional high spatial resolution observations are essential to investigate,
in a statistical way, the star formation in local LIRGs at the smallest scales
and to probe ultimately whether they share the same physical properties as
high-z LIRGs, ULIRGs and submillimiter galaxies.

gravity exerted by the fluid and the repelling cosmological constant. Using
global Fermi coordinates for the central observer within the fluid, the Fermi
velocity, the astrometric velocity, the kinematic velocity, and the
spectroscopic velocity, relative to the central (Fermi) observer, of a radially
receding test particle are calculated and compared. We find that the Fermi
relative velocity can exceed the speed of light in this model, but the presence
of a positive cosmological constant causes recessional speeds of distant high
energy particles to decrease rather than increase. We derive a version of
Hubble's law for this spacetime which might be applicable for the analysis of a
receding mass within a great void adjacent to a supercluster, relatively
isolated from gravitational sources other than the supercluster. We also
compare some of our results to related behavior in FRW cosmologies and consider
implications to arguments regarding the expansion of space.

respectively with intercalated insulating layers, are at the crossroads of
three families of crystalline solids: metals, doped Mott insulators, and
ferroelectrics. In the latter atomic displacements play a key role. Both the
metallic and the doped insulator approaches to high temperature
superconductivity are essentially electronic ones and do not directly involve
the lattice. By contrast, in a recently proposed Bond Contraction Pairing (BCP)
model, contraction of in-plane Cu-O (or As-Fe) bonds plays an essential role in
the pairing mechanism. Here we apply it to low angle grain boundaries and show
that their reduced critical current is due to tensile deformation generated by
dislocations. The model also explains why interface misfit dislocations, which
can result in a dead layer in the case of ferro-electrics, may improve vortex
pinning in the cuprates.

drivers are the determination of the physical properties of stars and the
characterisation of planets orbiting them, to very high precision. PHASES,
intended to be housed in a micro-satellite, consists of a 20 cm aperture
modified Baker telescope feeding two detectors: the tracking detector, with a
field of 1 degree square, and the science detector for performing
spectrophotometry. The optical design has been developed with the primary goal
of avoiding stray light on the science detector, while providing spectra in the
wavelength range 370-960 nm with a resolving power that ranges from ~900 at 370
nm to ~200 at 960 nm. The signal to noise per resolution element obtained for a
V=10 magnitude star in a 1 minute integration varies between ~ 35 and 140. An
analysis of the light curve constrains the radii of the planets relative to
their parent stars' radii, which are, in turn, tightly constrained by the
combination of absolute spectrophotometry and trigonometric parallaxes. The
provisional optical design satisfies all the scientific requirements, including
a ~1% rms flux calibration strategy based on observations of bright A-type
stars and model atmospheres, allowing the determination of stellar angular
diameters for nearby solar-like stars to 0.5%. This level of accuracy will be
propagated to the stellar radii for the nearest stars, with highly reliable
Hipparcos parallaxes, and more significantly, to the planetary radii.

nonaxisymmetric modes, the most unstable mode spirals in the opposite direction
to the background field. The standard (\beta=0) MRI is axisymmetric for weak
fields (including the instability with the lowest Reynolds number) but is
nonaxisymmetric for stronger fields. If the azimuthal field is due in part to
an axial current flowing through the fluid itself (and not just along the
central axis), then it is also unstable to the nonaxisymmetric Tayler
instability, which is most effective without rotation. For large \beta this

linear channel are known to be screened beyond a distance comparable to the

problems related to probability, the preferred basis, and multiplicity. The
third theme, I argue, is the most important one. It has led to developments of
the original approach into many-worlds, many-minds, and decoherence-based
approaches. The latter especially have been advocated in recent years, in an
effort to understand multiplicity without resorting to what is often perceived
as extravagant constructions. Drawing from and adding to arguments of others, I
show that proponents of decoherence-based approaches have not yet succeeded in
making their ontology clear.

steps is 5.67 (we have not found any examples which required more than 13
steps) and the relative number of steps with respect to the dimension decreases
dramatically. Roughly speaking, for high enough dimensions the absolute number
of steps is independent of the dimension.

Hall sequence, which amounts to computing the adiabatic evolution of the Hall
liquid when the anyons are moved along various trajectories. In this work, the
anyons are pinned to precise spatial configurations by using specific external
potentials. Such external potentials break the translational symmetry and it
appears that one will be forced to simulate the braidings on the entire
many-body Hilbert space, an absolutely prohibitive scenario. We demonstrate how
to overcome this difficulty and obtain the exact braidings for fairly large
Hall systems. For this, we show that the incompressible state of a general
$(k,m)$ fractional Hall sequence can be viewed as the unique zero mode of a
specific Hamiltonian $H^{(k,m)}$, whose form is explicitly derived by using
k-particles creation operators. The compressible Hall states corresponding to
$n$$\times$$k$ anyons fixed at $w_1$,...,$w_{nk}$ are shown to be the zero
modes of a pinning Hamiltonian $H^{(k,m)}_{w_1,...,w_{nk}}$, which is also
explicitly derived. The zero modes of $H^{(k,m)}_{w_1,...,w_{nk}}$ are shown to
be contained in the space of the zero modes of $H^{(k,m)}$. Therefore, the
computation of the braidings can be done entirely within this space, which we
map out for a number of Hall systems. Using this efficient computational
method, we study various properties of the Moore-Read states. In particular, we
give direct confirmation of their topological and non-abelian properties that
were previously implied from the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT)
structure of the Moore-Read state.

  Differential Operators","37 pages",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove global subelliptic estimates for systems of quadratic differential
operators. Quadratic differential operators are operators defined in the Weyl
quantization by complex-valued quadratic symbols. In a previous work, we
pointed out the existence of a particular linear subvector space in the phase
space intrinsically associated to their Weyl symbols, called singular space,
which rules a number of fairly general properties of non-elliptic quadratic
operators. About the subelliptic properties of these operators, we established
that quadratic operators with zero singular spaces fulfill global subelliptic
estimates with a loss of derivatives depending on certain algebraic properties
of the Hamilton maps associated to their Weyl symbols. The purpose of the
present work is to prove similar global subelliptic estimates for
overdetermined systems of quadratic operators. We establish here a simple
criterion for the subellipticity of these systems giving an explicit measure of
the loss of derivatives and highlighting the non-trivial interactions played by
the different operators composing those systems.
