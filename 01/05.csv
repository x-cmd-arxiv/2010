jet and reveal details of its internal structure, potentially allowing
discrimination of its partonic origin. In this work we make predictions for
quark and gluon jet shape distributions in N-jet final states in e+e-
collisions, defined with a cone or recombination algorithm, where we measure
some jet shape observable on a subset of these jets. Using the framework of
Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, we prove a factorization theorem for jet shape
distributions and demonstrate the consistent renormalization-group running of
the functions in the factorization theorem for any number of measured and
unmeasured jets, any number of quark and gluon jets, and any angular size R of
the jets, as long as R is much smaller than the angular separation between
jets. We calculate the jet and soft functions for angularity jet shapes \tau_a
to one-loop order (O(alpha_s)) and resum a subset of the large logarithms of
\tau_a needed for next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy for both cone and
kT-type jets. We compare our predictions for the resummed \tau_a distribution
of a quark or a gluon jet produced in a 3-jet final state in e+e- annihilation
to the output of a Monte Carlo event generator and find that the dependence on
a and R is very similar.

quantum systems and states which are far from product. If applied to a state
psi whose maximum overlap with a product state is 1-epsilon, the test passes
with probability 1-Theta(epsilon), regardless of n or the local dimensions of
the individual systems. The test uses two copies of psi. We prove correctness
of this test as a special case of a more general result regarding stability of
maximum output purity of the depolarising channel. A key application of the
test is to quantum Merlin-Arthur games with multiple Merlins, where we obtain
several structural results that had been previously conjectured, including the
fact that efficient soundness amplification is possible and that two Merlins
can simulate many Merlins: QMA(k)=QMA(2) for k>=2. Building on a previous
result of Aaronson et al, this implies that there is an efficient quantum
algorithm to verify 3-SAT with constant soundness, given two unentangled proofs
of O(sqrt(n) polylog(n)) qubits. We also show how QMA(2) with log-sized proofs
is equivalent to a large number of problems, some related to quantum
information (such as testing separability of mixed states) as well as problems
without any apparent connection to quantum mechanics (such as computing
injective tensor norms of 3-index tensors). As a consequence, we obtain many
hardness-of-approximation results, as well as potential algorithmic
applications of methods for approximating QMA(2) acceptance probabilities.
Finally, our test can also be used to construct an efficient test for
determining whether a unitary operator is a tensor product, which is a
generalisation of classical linearity testing.

diffusivity that depends on the local population density, can form stable
patterns. It is known that a decrease of swimming speed with density can
promote separation into bulk phases of two coexisting densities; this is
opposed by the logistic law for birth and death which allows only a single
uniform density to be stable. The result of this contest is an arrested
nonequilibrium phase separation in which dense droplets or rings become
separated by less dense regions, with a characteristic steady-state length
scale. Cell division mainly occurs in the dilute regions and cell death in the
dense ones, with a continuous flux between these sustained by the diffusivity
gradient. We formulate a mathematical model of this in a case involving
run-and-tumble bacteria, and make connections with a wider class of mechanisms
for density-dependent motility. No chemotaxis is assumed in the model, yet it
predicts the formation of patterns strikingly similar to those believed to
result from chemotactic behavior.

  Volume 1193, pp. 40-47 (2009)",,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian methods since the time of Laplace have been understood by their
practitioners as closely aligned to the scientific method. Indeed a recent
champion of Bayesian methods, E. T. Jaynes, titled his textbook on the subject
Probability Theory: the Logic of Science. Many philosophers of science
including Karl Popper and Donald Campbell have interpreted the evolution of
Science as a Darwinian process consisting of a 'copy with selective retention'
algorithm abstracted from Darwin's theory of Natural Selection. Arguments are
presented for an isomorphism between Bayesian Methods and Darwinian processes.
Universal Darwinism, as the term has been developed by Richard Dawkins, Daniel
Dennett and Susan Blackmore, is the collection of scientific theories which
explain the creation and evolution of their subject matter as due to the
operation of Darwinian processes. These subject matters span the fields of
atomic physics, chemistry, biology and the social sciences. The principle of
Maximum Entropy states that systems will evolve to states of highest entropy
subject to the constraints of scientific law. This principle may be inverted to
provide illumination as to the nature of scientific law. Our best cosmological
theories suggest the universe contained much less complexity during the period
shortly after the Big Bang than it does at present. The scientific subject
matter of atomic physics, chemistry, biology and the social sciences has been
created since that time. An explanation is proposed for the existence of this
subject matter as due to the evolution of constraints in the form of
adaptations imposed on Maximum Entropy. It is argued these adaptations were
discovered and instantiated through the operations of a succession of Darwinian
processes.

a Turing complete language for NP that is not many-one complete. Our first two

decomposition of the original stochastic control problem under the global
filtration into classical stochastic control problems under the reference
filtration, which are determined in a finite backward induction. Our method
revisits and extends in particular stochastic control of diffusion processes
with finite number of jumps. This study is motivated by optimization problems
arising in default risk management, and we provide applications of our
decomposition result for the indifference pricing of defaultable claims, and
the optimal investment under bilateral counterparty risk. The solutions are
expressed in terms of BSDEs involving only Brownian filtration, and remarkably
without jump terms coming from the default times and marks in the global
filtration.

f_n(X_1, ..., X_n) where f_1, ..., f_n are polynomials with positive real
coefficients. In vector form we denote such an equation system by X = f(X) and
call f a system of positive polynomials, short SPP. Equation systems of this
kind appear naturally in the analysis of stochastic models like stochastic
context-free grammars (with numerous applications to natural language
processing and computational biology), probabilistic programs with procedures,
web-surfing models with back buttons, and branching processes. The least
nonnegative solution mu f of an SPP equation X = f(X) is of central interest
for these models. Etessami and Yannakakis have suggested a particular version
of Newton's method to approximate mu f.
  We extend a result of Etessami and Yannakakis and show that Newton's method
starting at 0 always converges to mu f. We obtain lower bounds on the
convergence speed of the method. For so-called strongly connected SPPs we prove
the existence of a threshold k_f such that for every i >= 0 the (k_f+i)-th
iteration of Newton's method has at least i valid bits of mu f. The proof
yields an explicit bound for k_f depending only on syntactic parameters of f.
We further show that for arbitrary SPP equations Newton's method still
converges linearly: there are k_f>=0 and alpha_f>0 such that for every i>=0 the
(k_f+alpha_f i)-th iteration of Newton's method has at least i valid bits of mu
f. The proof yields an explicit bound for alpha_f; the bound is exponential in
the number of equations, but we also show that it is essentially optimal.
Constructing a bound for k_f is still an open problem. Finally, we also provide
a geometric interpretation of Newton's method for SPPs.

transiting planet identified by the NASA Kepler Mission. Kepler photometry and
Keck-HIRES radial velocities yield the radius and mass of the planet around
this F8IV subgiant host star. The planet has a radius RP = 1.419 RJ and a mass,
MP = 0.60 MJ, yielding a density of 0.26 g cm^-3, among the lowest density
planets known. The orbital period is P = 3.523 days and orbital semima jor axis
is 0.0483+0.0006/-0.0012 AU. The star has a large rotational v sin i of 10.5
+/- 0.7 km s^-1 and is relatively faint (V = 13.89 mag), both properties
deleterious to precise Doppler measurements. The velocities are indeed noisy,
with scatter of 30 m s^-1, but exhibit a period and phase consistent with the
planet implied by the photometry. We securely detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect, confirming the planet's existence and establishing its orbit as
prograde. We measure an inclination between the projected planetary orbital
axis and the projected stellar rotation axis of lambda = -26.9 +/- 4.6 deg,
indicating a moderate inclination of the planetary orbit. Rossiter-McLaughlin
measurements of a large sample of transiting planets from Kepler will provide a
statistically robust measure of the true distribution of spin-orbit
orientations for hot jupiters in general.

RXJ0720.4-3125 in V Bessel filter in January 2008. We derive the visual
magnitude by standard star aperture photometry.Using sophisticated resampling
software we correct the images for field distortions. Then we derive an updated
position and proper motion value by comparing its position with FORS 1
observations of December 2000. We calculate a visual magnitude of V = 26.81 +-
0.09mag, which is seven times in excess of what is expected from X-ray data,
but consistent with the extant U, B and R data. Over about a seven year epoch
difference we measured a proper motion of mu = 105.1 +- 7.4mas/yr towards theta
= 296.951 deg +- 0.0063 deg (NW), consistent with previous data.

gamma-ray) are shedding new light on cosmic-ray physics. A comprehensive
picture of these data relies on an accurate determination of the transport and
source parameters of propagation models. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used to
obtain these parameters in a diffusion model. From the measurement of the B/C
ratio and radioactive cosmic-ray clocks, we calculate their probability density
functions, with a special emphasis on the halo size L of the Galaxy and the
local underdense bubble of size r_h. The analysis relies on the USINE code for
propagation and on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique (Putze et al. 2009,
paper I of this series) for the parameter determination. As found in previous
studies, the B/C best-fit model favours diffusion/convection/reacceleration
(Model III) over diffusion/reacceleration (Model II). A combined fit on B/C and
the isotopic ratios (10Be/9Be, 26Al/27Al, 36Cl/Cl) leads to L ~ 8 kpc and r_h ~
120 pc for the best-fit Model III. This value for r_h is consistent with direct
measurements of the local interstallar medium. For Model II, L ~ 4 kpc and r_h
is consistent with zero. We showed the potential and usefulness of the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo technique in the analysis of cosmic-ray measurements in
diffusion models. The size of the diffusive halo depends crucially on the value
of the diffusion slope delta, and also on the presence/absence of the local
underdensity damping effect on radioactive nuclei. More precise data from
on-going experiments are expected to clarify this issue.

using different inputs (gas density and hydrogen fraction in the Galactic disc,
source spectral shape, low-energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient, and
nuclear fragmentation cross-sections) on the best-fit values of the transport
parameters. We quantify the systematics produced when varying these inputs, and
compare them to statistical uncertainties. We discuss the consequences for the
slope of the diffusion coefficient delta. The analysis relies on the
propagation code USINE interfaced with the Minuit minimisation routines. We
find the typical systematic uncertainties to be larger than the statistical
ones. The several published values of delta (from 0.3 to 0.8) can be recovered
when varying the low-energy shape of the diffusion coefficient and the
convective wind strength. Models including a convective wind are characterised
by delta > 0.6, which cannot be reconcile with the expected theoretical values
(1/3 and 1/2). However, from a statistical point of view (chi^2 analysis),
models with both reacceleration and convection-hence large delta-are favoured.
The next favoured models in line yield delta that can be accommodated with 1/3

(and no convection). To date, using the best statistical tools, the transport
parameter determination is still plagued by many unknowns at low energy (~
GeV/n). To disentangle between all these configurations, measurements of the
B/C ratio at TeV/n energies and/or combination with other secondary-to-primary

possible to simultaneously embed two edge-disjoint trees. As a final result, we
study the same problem when some constraints on the tree are imposed. Namely,
we show that a tree of depth 2 and a path always admit a geometric simultaneous

(i.e. Eddington) limit, where the radiation pressure is balanced by the
gravitational pressure - imply the presence of an accreting black hole with a
mass of ~10^2-10^5 times that of the Sun. The existence of such intermediate
mass black holes is in dispute, and though many candidates have been proposed,
none are widely accepted as definitive. Here we report the detection of a
variable X-ray source with a maximum 0.2-10 keV luminosity of up to 1.2 x 10^42
erg s^-1 in the edge-on spiral galaxy ESO 243-49, with an implied conservative
lower limit of the mass of the black hole of ~500 Msun. This finding presents
the strongest observational evidence to date for the existence of intermediate
mass black holes, providing the long sought after missing link between the
stellar mass and super-massive black hole populations.

report and discuss the results of a study on the X-ray emission properties of
the X-ray source 1ES 1210-646, recently classified as a high-mass X-ray binary
through optical spectroscopy. This is the first in-depth analysis of the X-ray
spectral characteristics of this source. We found that the flux of 1ES 1210-646
varies by a factor of about 3 on a timescale of hundreds of seconds and by a
factor of at least 10 among observations acquired over a time span of several
months. The X-ray spectrum of 1ES 1210-646 is described using a simple powerlaw
shape or, in the case of INTEGRAL data, with a blackbody plus powerlaw model.
Spectral variability is found in connection with different flux levels of the
source. A strong and transient iron emission line with an energy of about 6.7
keV and an equivalent width of about 1.6 keV is detected when the source is
found at an intermediate flux level. The line strength seems to be tied to the
orbital motion of the accreting object, as this feature is only apparent at the
periastron. Although the X-ray spectral description we find for the 1ES
1210-646 emission is quite atypical for a high-mass X-ray binary, the
multiwavelegth information available for this object leads us to confirm this
classification. The results presented here allow us instead to definitely rule
out the possibility that 1ES 1210-646 is a (magnetic) cataclysmic variable as
proposed previously and, in a broader sense, a white dwarf nature for the
accretor is disfavoured. X-ray spectroscopic data actually suggest a neutron
star with a low magnetic field as the accreting object in this system.

suggest that the Higgs is a composite state, predominantly of the 4th
generation heavy quarks. Motivated by the above, we show that the three-prong
composite solution to the SM4 can have interesting new implications for Higgs
phenomenology. For example, the Higgs can decay to a single heavy 4th
generation quark via the 3-body decays (through an off-shell t' or b') H ->
t'(bar) t'* -> t'(bar) b W+ and H -> b'(bar) b'* -> b'(bar) t W-. These flavor
diagonal decays can be dramatically enhanced at the LHC (by several orders of
magnitudes) due to the large width effects of the resonating heavy Higgs in the
processes gg -> H -> t'(bar) t'* -> t'(bar) b W+ and gg -> H -> b'(bar) b'* ->
b'(bar) t W-, thus yielding a viable signal above the corresponding continuum
QCD production rates. In addition, the Higgs can decay to a single t' and b' in
the loop-generated flavor changing (FC) channels H -> b' b(bar), t' t(bar).
These FC decays are essentially ""GIM-free"" and can, therefore, have branching
ratios as large as 10^{-4} - 10^{-3}.

detection is sensitive to planets over a range of projected separations

half of high-mag events were successfully monitored and half of these yielded
planet detections. The planet frequency derived from microlensing is a factor 7
larger than from RV studies at factor ~25 smaller separations [2<P<2000 days].
However, this difference is basically consistent with the gradient derived from
RV studies (when extrapolated well beyond the separations from which it is

semi-major axis, 2 dex in mass ratio, and 0.3 dex in host mass. Finally, if all

of two heavy partners of the top quark, which is readily achieved over much of
the parameter space. We can then obtain both a vacuum expectation value of
$v=246$ GeV and a light Higgs boson mass, which is strongly correlated with the
masses of the two heavy top quark partners. For a scale of the global symmetry
breaking of $f=1$ TeV and using a single cutoff for the fermion loops, the
Higgs boson mass satisfies 120 GeV $\lesssim M_H\lesssim150$ GeV over much of
the range of parameter space. For $f$ raised to 10 TeV, these values increase
by about 40 GeV. Effects at the ultraviolet cutoff scale may also raise the
predicted values of the Higgs boson mass, but the model still favors
$M_H\lesssim 200$ GeV.

polynomial-time algorithms for approximately minimizing the kernel distance

(iii) We provide several general techniques for reducing complex objects to
convenient sparse representations (specifically to point sets or sets of points
sets) which approximately preserve the kernel distance. In particular, this
allows us to reduce problems of computing the kernel distance between various
types of objects such as curves, surfaces, and distributions to computing the
kernel distance between point sets. These take advantage of the reproducing
kernel Hilbert space and a new relation linking binary range spaces to
continuous range spaces with bounded fat-shattering dimension.

by introducing a new parameter epsilon=E_{gamma, iso,52}/E^{5/3}_{p,z,2}, where
E_{\gamma,iso} is the isotropic gamma-ray energy (in units of 10^{52} erg), and
E_{p,z} is the cosmic rest frame spectral peak energy (in units of 100 keV).
For those short GRBs with ""extended emission"", both quantities are defined for
the short/hard spike only. With the current complete sample of GRBs with
redshift and E_p measurements, the epsilon parameter shows a clear bimodal
distribution with a separation at epsilon ~ 0.03. The high-epsilon region
encloses the typical long GRBs with high-luminosity, some high-z
""rest-frame-short"" GRBs (such as GRB 090423 and GRB 080913), as well as some
high-z short GRBs (such as GRB 090426). All these GRBs have been claimed to be
of the Type II origin based on other observational properties in the
literature. All the GRBs that are argued to be of the Type I origin are found
to be clustered in the low-epsilon region. They can be separated from some
nearby low-luminosity long GRBs (in 3sigma) by an additional T_{90} criterion,
i.e. T_{90,z}<~ 5 s in the Swift/BAT band. We suggest that this new
classification scheme can better match the physically-motivated Type II/I

(IGRT) to acquire updated volumetric anatomical information before treatment
fractions for accurate patient alignment purpose. However, the excessive x-ray
imaging dose from serial CBCT scans raises a clinical concern in most IGRT
procedures. The excessive imaging dose can be effectively reduced by reducing
the number of x-ray projections and/or lowering mAs levels in a CBCT scan. The
goal of this work is to develop a fast GPU-based algorithm to reconstruct high
quality CBCT images from undersampled and noisy projection data so as to lower
the imaging dose. The CBCT is reconstructed by minimizing an energy functional
consisting of a data fidelity term and a total variation regularization term.
We developed a GPU-friendly version of the forward-backward splitting algorithm
to solve this model. A multi-grid technique is also employed. We test our CBCT
reconstruction algorithm on a digital NCAT phantom and a head-and-neck patient
case. The performance under low mAs is also validated using a physical Catphan
phantom and a head-and-neck Rando phantom. It is found that 40 x-ray
projections are sufficient to reconstruct CBCT images with satisfactory quality
for IGRT patient alignment purpose. Phantom experiments indicated that CBCT
images can be successfully reconstructed with our algorithm under as low as 0.1
mAs/projection level. Comparing with currently widely used full-fan
head-and-neck scanning protocol of about 360 projections with 0.4
mAs/projection, it is estimated that an overall 36 times dose reduction has
been achieved with our algorithm. Moreover, the reconstruction time is about
130 sec on an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card, which is estimated ~100 times faster
than similar iterative reconstruction approaches.

Radial velocity measurements from the Keck HIRES spectrograph show a reflex
Doppler signal of 9.3 (+1.1 -1.9) m/s, consistent with a low-eccentricity orbit
with the phase expected from the transits. Various tests show no evidence for
any companion star near enough to affect the light curve or the radial

mean density, combined with analysis of high-resolution spectra, we infer that
the host star is near turnoff from the main sequence, with estimated mass and

thus slightly denser and more massive than Neptune, but about the same size.

costs, energy density, thermal efficiency, plant construction cost, interest
rate, capacity factor, and operations and maintenance cost. The dominant
determinants of costs have been the price of coal and plant construction cost.
The price of coal appears to fluctuate more or less randomly while the
construction cost follows long-term trends, decreasing from 1902 - 1970,
increasing from 1970 - 1990, and leveling off since then. Our analysis
emphasizes the importance of using long time series and comparing electricity
generation technologies using decomposed total costs, rather than costs of
single components like capital. By taking this approach we find that the
history of coal-fired electricity costs suggests there is a fluctuating floor
to its future costs, which is determined by coal prices. Even if construction
costs resumed a decreasing trend, the cost of coal-based electricity would drop
for a while but eventually be determined by the price of coal, which fluctuates
while showing no long-term trend.

a cyclic group $Z_m$ with the order of $A$ coprime with $m$. More precisely,
the running time of that algorithm is almost linear in the order of the input

to approximate using a randomized algorithm, but for which no constant factor
deterministic polynomial time approximation is known. A breakthrough due to
Kahn, Kim, Lovasz and Vu yielded a (log log n)^2 polynomial time approximation.
We refine this upper bound, and show that the resulting bound is sharp and
explicitly computable in random graphs. Cooper and Frieze showed that the cover
time of the largest component of the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,c/n) in the
supercritical regime with c>1 fixed, is asymptotic to f(c) n \log^2 n, where
f(c) tends to 1 as c tends to 1. However, our new bound implies that the cover
time for the critical Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,1/n) has order n, and shows
how the cover time evolves from the critical window to the supercritical phase.
Our general estimate also yields the order of the cover time for a variety of
other concrete graphs, including critical percolation clusters on the Hamming
hypercube {0,1}^n, on high-girth expanders, and on tori Z_n^d for fixed large
d. For the graphs we consider, our results show that the blanket time,
introduced by Winkler and Zuckerman, is within a constant factor of the cover
time. Finally, we prove that for any connected graph, adding an edge can
increase the cover time by at most a factor of 4.

financial variables have quantum-mechanical interpretation and satisfy the

single collective field we provide an alternative to traditional approaches,
which emphasize one-particle orbitals. We refer to our approach as continuum
mechanics for quantum many-body systems. In the linear response regime, the
equation of motion for the displacement field becomes a linear fourth-order
integro-differential equation, whose only inputs are the one-particle density
matrix and the pair correlation function of the ground-state. The complexity of
this equation remains essentially unchanged as the number of particles
increases. We show that our equation of motion is a hermitian eigenvalue
problem, which admits a complete set of orthonormal eigenfunctions under a
scalar product that involves the ground-state density. Further, we show that
the excitation energies derived from this approach satisfy a sum rule which
guarantees the exactness of the integrated spectral strength. Our formulation
becomes exact for systems consisting of a single particle, and for any

of transition to homogeneity is defined as the scale above which the fractal

to achieve this equality. Recently we have defined the scale of homogeneity to
be the scale above which the deviation of fractal dimension from the ambient
dimension becomes smaller than the statistical dispersion. In this paper we use
the relation between the fractal dimensions and the correlation function to
compute the dispersion for any given model in the limit of weak clustering
amplitude. We compare the deviation and dispersion for the LCDM model and
discuss the implication of this comparison for the expected scale of
homogeneity in the concordant model of cosmology. We estimate the upper limit
to the scale of homogeneity to be close to 260 Mpc/h for the LCDM model. Actual
estimates of the scale of homogeneity should be smaller than this as we have
considered only statistical contribution to the dispersion in fractal dimension
and we have ignored cosmic variance and contributions due to survey geometry
and the selection function. We find that as long as non linear correction are
insignificant, scale of homogeneity as defined above does not change with
epoch. The scale of homogeneity depends very weakly on the choice of tracer of
the density field. Thus the suggested definition of the scale of homogeneity is
fairly robust.

deviations are observed because of the splitting of the second peak as $\phi$
is increased towards random close packing. The distribution of the Voronoi free

and Ballistic Cluster-Cluster Aggregate aggregates of 128 spherical monomers.
We first investigated that the size parameter of the monomer, $x$ $\sim$ 1.56

observed dust scattering properties at three wavelengths $\lambda = 0.365$$\mu
m$, 0.485$\mu m$ and 0.684$\mu m$. Thus the effective radius of the aggregate
(r) lies in the range $0.45 \mu m \le r \le 0.49 \mu m$ at $\lambda =
0.365$$\mu m$; $ 0.60 \mu m \le r \le 0.66 \mu m$ at $\lambda = 0.485$$\mu m$
and $0.88 \mu m \le r \le 0.94 \mu m$ at $\lambda = 0.684$$\mu m$. Now using
superposition \textsc{t-matrix} code and the power-law size distribution, $n(r)
\sim r^{-3}$, the best-fitting values of complex refractive indices are
calculated which can best fit the observed polarization data at the above three
wavelengths. The best-fitting complex refractive indices $(n,k)$ are found to
be (1.745, 0.095) at $\lambda = 0.365 $ $\mu m$, (1.743, 0.100) at $\lambda =

the robot situated at a point p of the terrain explores (sees) all points q of
the terrain for which the segment pq belongs to the terrain, and the limited
vision, when we require additionally that the distance between p and q be at

the performance of an exploration algorithm is measured by the length of the
trajectory of the robot. For unlimited vision we show an exploration algorithm
with complexity O(P + D?k), where P is the total perimeter of the terrain
(including perimeters of obstacles), D is the diameter of the convex hull of
the terrain, and k is the number of obstacles. We do not assume knowledge of
these parameters. We also prove a matching lower bound showing that the above
complexity is optimal, even if the terrain is known to the robot. For limited

is the area of the terrain (excluding obstacles). Our algorithms work either
for arbitrary terrains, if one of the parameters A or k is known, or for c-fat

several new features. While the blue-shifted absorption is likely due to
outflowing gas, toward the BN object we detect CO in emission extending in
diameter to ~3300AU. Although at the observational spectral resolution limit,
the 13CO line width of that feature increases with energy levels, consistent
with a disk origin. If one attributes the extended CO emission also to a disk
origin, its extent is consistent with other massive disk candidates in the
literature. For source n, we also find the blue-shifted CO absorption likely
from an outflow. However, it also exhibits a narrower range of redshifted CO
absorption and adjacent weak CO emission, consistent with infalling motions. We
do not spatially resolve the emission for source n. For both sources we conduct
a Boltzmann analysis of the 13CO absorption features and find temperatures
between 100 and 160K, and H2 column densities of the order a few times
10^23cm^-2. The observational signatures from IRC3 are very different with only
weak absorption against a much weaker continuum source. However, the CO
emission is extended and shows wedge-like position velocity signatures
consistent with jet-entrainment of molecular gas, potentially associated with
the Orion-KL outflow system. We also present and discuss the Pfund beta and H2
emission in the region.

coupling of collective degrees of freedom with internal excitations. Close to
the barrier, both quantum, statistical and non-Markovian effects are expected
to be important. In this work, a new approach based on quantum Monte-Carlo
addressing this problem is presented. The exact dynamics of a system coupled to
an environment is replaced by a set of stochastic evolutions of the system
density. The quantum Monte-Carlo method is applied to systems with quadratic
potentials. In all range of temperature and coupling, the stochastic method
matches the exact evolution showing that non-Markovian effects can be simulated
accurately. A comparison with other theories like Nakajima-Zwanzig or
Time-ConvolutionLess ones shows that only the latter can be competitive if the
expansion in terms of coupling constant is made at least to fourth order. A
systematic study of the inverted parabola case is made at different
temperatures and coupling constants. The asymptotic passing probability is
estimated in different approaches including the Markovian limit. Large
differences with the exact result are seen in the latter case or when only
second order in the coupling strength is considered as it is generally assumed
in nuclear transport models. On opposite, if fourth order in the coupling or
quantum Monte-Carlo method is used, a perfect agreement is obtained.

nucleic acid strands in aqueous solution can be described by the so-called
nearest-neighbor model, which estimates the hybridization free energy of a
given sequence as a sum of dinucleotide terms. Compared with its solution
counterparts, hybridization in DNA microarrays may be hindered due to the
presence of a solid surface and of a high density of DNA strands. We present
here a study aimed at the determination of hybridization free energies in DNA
microarrays. Experiments are performed on custom Agilent slides. The solution
contains a single oligonucleotide. The microarray contains spots with a perfect
matching complementary sequence and other spots with one or two mismatches: in
total 1006 different probe spots, each replicated 15 times per microarray. The
free energy parameters are directly fitted from microarray data. The
experiments demonstrate a clear correlation between hybridization free energies
in the microarray and in solution. The experiments are fully consistent with
the Langmuir model at low intensities, but show a clear deviation at
intermediate (non-saturating) intensities. These results provide new
interesting insights for the quantification of molecular interactions in DNA

Recently Mathai and Wu defined and studied the analytic torsion for the twisted
de Rham complex with an odd degree closed differential form $H$, other than one
form, as a flux and with coefficients in $E$. In this paper we generalize the
construction of the refined analytic torsion to the twisted de Rham complex. We
show that the refined analytic torsion of the twisted de Rham complex is
independent of the choice of the Riemannian metric on $M$ and the Hermitian
metric on $E$. We also show that the twisted refined analytic torsion is
invariant (under a natural identification) if $H$ is deformed within its
cohomology class. We prove a duality theorem, establishing a relationship
between the twisted refined analytic torsion corresponding to a flat connection
and its dual. We also define the twisted analogue of the Ray-Singer metric and
calculate the twisted Ray-Singer metric of the twisted refined analytic
torsion. In particular we show that in case that the Hermtitian connection is
flat, the twisted refined analytic torsion is an element with the twisted

the initial angle between the orbit and the disc is larger than some critical
value which may be significantly smaller than the classical value of 39
degrees. Both the eccentricity and the inclination angle then vary periodically
with time. When the period of the oscillations of the eccentricity is smaller
than the disc lifetime, the planet may be left on an eccentric orbit as the

from collisions between particles. Counterintuitively, the highest flow rate is
observed when the number of grains per density wave grows large. We find strong
indication that the number of grains per density wave always approaches a

analytically and numerically. A realistic model of the junction is considered
by taking into account a nonuniform current distribution, surface losses and
self-pumping effects. An approximate analytical solution of the modified
sine-Gordon equation is derived in the form of a unidirectional dense fluxon
train accompanied by two oppositely directed plasma waves. Next, some
macroscopic time-averaged quantities are calculated making possible to evaluate
the current-voltage characteristic of the junction. The results obtained by the
present method are compared with direct numerical simulations both for the
current-voltage characteristics and for the loss factor modulated spatially due
to the self-pumping. The comparison shows very good agreement for typical
junction parameters but indicates also some limitations of the method.

determined by a pair of corners of a given polygon and can be computed in
linear time, as known by Hershberger and Suri. For general polygonal domains
with h >= 1, however, no algorithm for computing the geodesic diameter was
known prior to this paper. In this paper, we present the first algorithms that
compute the geodesic diameter of a given polygonal domain in worst-case time
O(n^7.73) or O(n^7 (log n + h)). The main difficulty unlike the simple polygon
case relies on the following observation revealed in this paper: two interior
points can determine the geodesic diameter and in that case there exist at
least five distinct shortest paths between the two.

is an interesting place for studying the impact of early-type stars with strong
radiation fields and powerful winds on the formation processes of low-mass
stars. To investigate this process, it is necessary to determine the
characteristics (age, presence, or absence of circumstellar material) of the
population of low-mass pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in the cluster. We
obtained deep U B V (R I)_c H-alpha photometric data of the entire cluster as
well as medium-resolution optical spectroscopy of a subsample of X-ray selected
objects. Our spectroscopic data reveal only very weak H-alpha emission lines in
a few X-ray selected PMS candidates. We photometrically identify a number of
H-alpha emission candidates but their cluster membership is uncertain. We find
that the fainter objects in the field of view have a wide range of extinction
(up to A_V = 20), one X-ray selected OB star having A_V ~ 8. Our investigation
uncovers a population of PMS stars in NGC 6383 that are probably coeval with HD
159176. In addition, we detect a population of reddened objects that are
probably located at different depths within the natal molecular cloud of the
cluster. Finally, we identify a rather complex spatial distribution of H-alpha
emitters, which is probably indicative of a severe contamination by foreground
and background stars.

different spatial resolutions and coverage of the two sets of observations have
allowed us to investigate the properties and kinematics of the warm ionized gas

the position angle of the H_alpha rotation axis for the main body of the galaxy
is consistent with the HI rotation axis at PA = 39 deg, but that the ionized
gas in the central 20x20 arcsecs (~2x2 kpc) is kinematically decoupled from the
rest of the system, and rotates at a PA approximately perpendicular to that of
the main body of the galaxy at +40 deg. We find no evidence of coherent
large-scale galactic outflows. Instead multiple narrow emission line components
seen within a radius of ~1-1.5 kpc, and high [SII]/H_alpha ratios found beyond
~2 kpc implying a strong contribution from shocks, suggest that the intense
star formation is driving material outwards from the main star forming zone in
the form of a series of interacting superbubbles/shells.
  A broad component (100<FWHM<230 km/s) to the H_alpha line is identified
throughout galaxy disk out to >2 kpc. Based on recent work, we conclude that it
is produced in turbulent mixing layers on the surfaces of cool gas knots
embedded within the ISM, set up by the feedback from young massive star
clusters. Our data suggest a physical limit to the radius where the broad
emission line component is significant, and we propose that this limit marks a
significant transition point in the development of the galactic outflow, where
turbulent motion becomes less dominant. This mirrors what has recently been
found in another similar irregular starburst galaxy NGC 1569.

of a factorization scale, the dependence of theoretical predictions (at finite
order) on the choice of a factorization scheme has been little investigated.
This is due to the fact that the freedom in the choice of a factorization
scheme is enormous, even at NLO. One of the reason why to study factorization
schemes is the possible exploitation of the freedom in their choice in the
construction of NLO Monte Carlo event generators with NLO initial state parton
showers. However, the ZERO factorization scheme, which should be optimal for
such Monte Carlo event generators, has turned out to be practically
inapplicable although it appears at first sight as reasonable. A detailed
analysis has then shown that if some given NLO splitting functions do not
satisfy a certain nontrivial condition, then the corresponding factorization
scheme has some restrictions on its practical applicability. Relevant technical
details of the discussed issues are the content of this short contribution.

lower temperatures T_f=2500K, 2750K, 3000K, 3250K and observed after a waiting

generalized incoherent intermediate scattering function C_q(t_w, t_w+t), and

three different t_w regions: (I) At very short waiting times, C_q(t_w, t_w+t)
decays very fast without forming a plateau. Similarly msd(t_w,t_w+t) increases
without forming a plateau. (II) With increasing t_w a plateau develops in
C_q(t_w, t_w+t) and msd(t_w,t_w+t). For intermediate waiting times the plateau
height is independent of t_w and T_i. Time superposition applies, i.e.
C_q=C_q(t/t_r) where t_r=t_r(t_w) is a waiting time dependent decay time.
Furthermore C_q=C(q,t_w,t_w+t) scales as C_q=C(q,z(t_w,t) where z is a function
of t_w and t only, i.e. independent of q. (III) At large t_w the system reaches
equilibrium, i.e. C_q(t_w,t_w+t) and msd(t_w,t_w+t) are independent of t_w and
T_i. For C_q(t_w,t_w+t) we find that the time superposition of intermediate

active users sharing $u$ frequency sub-bands. Users are asynchronous meaning
there exists a mutual delay between their transmitted codes. A stationary model
for interference is considered by assuming the starting point of an
interferer's data is uniformly distributed along the codeword of any user. The
spectrum is divided to private and common bands each containing
$v_{\mathrm{p}}$ and $v_{\mathrm{c}}$ frequency sub-bands respectively. We
consider a scenario where all transmitters are unaware of the number of active
users and the channel gains. The optimum $v_{\mathrm{p}}$ and $v_{\mathrm{c}}$
are obtained such that the so-called outage capacity per user is maximized. If
$\Pr\{\mathbf{n}\leq 2\}=1$, upper and lower bounds on the mutual information
between the input and output of the channel for each user are derived using a
genie-aided technique. The proposed bounds meet each other as the code length
grows to infinity yielding a closed expression for the achievable rates. If
$\Pr\{\mathbf{n}>2\}>0$, all users follow a locally Randomized On-Off signaling
scheme on the common band where each transmitter quits transmitting its
Gaussian signals independently from transmission to transmission. Using a
conditional version of Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) and an upper bound on the
differential entropy of a mixed Gaussian random variable, lower bounds on the
achievable rates of users are developed. Thereafter, the activation probability
on each transmission slot is designed resulting in the largest outage capacity.

\emph{Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal.,} 23 (2007), pp. 74--113] for plane curves to
the case of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb R^n$. Let $M$ be a compact connected
oriented $n-1$ dimensional manifold without boundary like the sphere or the
torus. Then shape space is either the manifold of submanifolds of $\mathbb R^n$
of type $M$, or the orbifold of immersions from $M$ to $\mathbb R^n$ modulo the
group of diffeomorphisms of $M$. We investigate almost local Riemannian metrics
on shape space. These are induced by metrics of the following form on the space
of immersions: $$ G_f(h,k) = \int_{M}
\Phi(\on{Vol}(f),\operatorname{Tr}(L))\g(h, k) \operatorname{vol}(f^*\g),$$
where $\g$ is the Euclidean metric on $\mathbb R^n$, $f^*\g$ is the induced
metric on $M$, $h,k\in C^\infty(M,\mathbb R^n)$ are tangent vectors at $f$ to
the space of embeddings or immersions, where $\Phi:\mathbb R^2\to \mathbb
R_{>0}$ is a suitable smooth function, $\operatorname{Vol}(f) =
\int_M\operatorname{vol}(f^*\g)$ is the total hypersurface volume of $f(M)$,
and the trace $\operatorname{Tr}(L)$ of the Weingarten mapping is the mean
curvature. For these metrics we compute the geodesic equations both on the
space of immersions and on shape space, the conserved momenta arising from the
obvious symmetries, and the sectional curvature. For special choices of $\Phi$
we give complete formulas for the sectional curvature. Numerical experiments
illustrate the behavior of these metrics.

in terms of the existence of a continuous linear operator, called an invariant
expectation, whose properties make it a weak counterpart of an invariant mean
on a group. We apply this operator to show that exactness of a finitely
generated group $G$ implies the vanishing of the bounded cohomology of $G$ with
coefficients in a new class of modules, which are defined using the Hopf
algebra structure of $\ell_1(G)$.

sampling algorithm for Bayesian data analysis in general and its MultiNest
implementation in particular. He introduces a new method for evidence
evaluation based on the idea of Voronoi tessellation and requiring samples from
the posterior distribution obtained through MCMC based methods. He compares its
accuracy and efficiency with MultiNest, concluding that it outperforms
MultiNest in several cases. This comparison is completely unfair since the
proposed method can not perform the complete Bayesian data analysis including
posterior exploration and evidence evaluation on its own while MultiNest allows
one to perform Bayesian data analysis end to end. Furthermore, their criticism
of nested sampling (and in turn MultiNest) is based on a few conceptual
misunderstandings of the algorithm. Here we seek to set the record straight.

confining potential of the edge in nonequilibrium 2D homogeneous electronic
gas. We derive a simple analytical result for the magnitude of the current
induced spin polarization at the edge and prove that it is independent of the
details of the confinement edge potential and the electronic density within
realistic values of the parameters of the considered models. While the
amplitude of the spin accumulation is comparable to the experimental values of
extrinsic spin Hall effect in similar samples, the spatial extent of edge
induced effect is restricted to the distances of the order of Fermi wavelength
($\sim$ 10nm).
