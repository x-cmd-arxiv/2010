galaxies and their host dark matter halos, as characterized by the stellar
mass-halo mass (SM-HM) relation, with rigorous consideration of uncertainties.
Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance matching technique, which
assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo above a specific mass threshold
hosts one galaxy. We discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties in
observed galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) (including stellar mass
estimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmology
and uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique used
to link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis
results in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution from z=0
to z=4. The shape and evolution are well constrained for z < 1. The largest
uncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates; however,
failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead to
errors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central galaxies in
massive halos. We also investigate the SM-HM relation to z=4, although the
shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained when
uncertainties are taken into account. These results will provide a powerful
tool to inform galaxy evolution models. [Abridged]

Current bounds on many of these operators from low energy experiments are very
weak or nonexistent, and they may lead to clean mu+tau- and mu-tau+ signals at
hadron colliders. At the Tevatron with 8 inverse femtobarns, one can exceed
current bounds for most operators, with most 2 sigma sensitivities being in the

integrated luminosity, one can reach a 2 sigma sensitivity for Lambda \sim 3-10

that are accelerated in a decelerating relativistic shock wave and escape ahead
of the shock. It is assumed that at any given time the CRs have a power law
form, carry a constant fraction of the energy E_tot of the shocked plasma, and
escape continuously at the maximal energy attainable. The spectrum of escaping
particles is highly sensitive to the instantaneous spectral index due to the
fact that the minimal energy, E_min ~ \Gamma^2 m_pc^2 where \Gamma is the shock
Lorentz factor, changes with time. In particular, the escaping spectrum may be
considerably harder than the canonical N(E)\propto E^-2 spectrum. For a shock
expanding into a plasma of density n, a spectral break is expected at the
maximal energy attainable at the transition to non relativistic velocities, E ~
10^19 (\epsilon_B/0.1)(n/1 cm^-3)^(1/6)(E_tot/10^51 erg)^(1/3) eV where
\epsilon_B is the fraction of the energy flux carried by the magnetic field. If
ultra-high energy CRs are generated in decelerating relativistic blast waves

Despite this, its thermodynamic properties remain largely unchanged if Neel
order is restored by the addition of a degeneracy-lifting perturbation, e.g.,
further neighbor interactions. Here we show how these apparent contradictions
can be resolved by a proper understanding of way in which long-range Neel order
emerges out of well-formed local correlations, and identify nematic and
vector-multipole orders hidden in the different Coulomb phases of the model. So
far as experiment is concerned, our results suggest that where long range

it applies to all values of the polynomial variable that lie on the unit circle
in the complex plane. Letting C(K) denote the Hilbert space for this model,
there is a natural unitary transformation U from C(K) to itself such that <K> =
<F|U|F> where |F> is a sum over basis states for C(K). The quantum algorithm
arises directly from this formula via the Hadamard Test. We then show that the
framework for our quantum model for the bracket polynomial is a natural setting
for Khovanov homology. The Hilbert space C(K) of our model has basis in
one-to-one correspondence with the enhanced states of the bracket state
summmation and is isomorphic with the chain complex for Khovanov homology with
coefficients in the complex numbers. We show that for the Khovanov boundary
operator d defined on C(K) we have the relationship dU + Ud = 0. Consequently,
the unitary operator U acts on the Khovanov homology, and we therefore obtain a
direct relationship between Khovanov homology and this quantum algorithm for
the Jones polynomial. The formula for the Jones polynomial as a graded Euler
characteristic is now expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of U and the Euler
characteristics of the eigenspaces of U in the homology. The quantum algorithm
given here is inefficient, and so it remains an open problem to determine
better quantum algorithms that involve both the Jones polynomial and the

evaluation of arbitrary one-body observable. However, when applied to Large
Amplitude Collective Motion (LACM) this approach needs to be extended in order
to accommodate the phenomenon of surface-hoping, when adiabaticity is strongly
violated and the description of a system using a single (generalized) Slater
determinant is not valid anymore. The functional integral approach on the other
hand does not appear to have such restrictions, but its implementation does not
appear to be straightforward endeavor. However, within a functional integral
approach one seems to be able to evaluate in principle any kind of observables,
such as the fragment mass and energy distributions in nuclear fission. These
two radically approaches can likely be brought brought together by formulating
a stochastic time-dependent DFT approach to many-body dynamics.

photometric information alone is confounded by source confusion. However, with
the addition of spectroscopic information it is possible to distinguish between
blends and areas where the light is dominated by a single star using the widths
of absorption features. We describe a procedure for identifying locations in
kinematically hot environments where the light is dominated by a single star,
and apply this method to spectra with 0.1 arcsec angular resolution covering
the 2.1 - 2.3 micron interval in the central regions of M32. Targets for
detailed investigation are selected as areas of localized brightness
enhancement. Three locations where at least 60% of the K-band light comes from
a single bright star, and another with light that is dominated by two stars
with very different velocities, are identified. The dominant stars are evolving
near the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), and have M5 III spectral
type. The lack of a dispersion in spectral-type suggests that the upper AGB
within the central arcsec of M32 has a dispersion in J-K of only a few
hundreths of a magnitude, in agreement with what is seen at larger radii. One
star has weaker atomic absorption lines than the others, such that [M/H] is 0.2
dex lower. Such a difference in metallicity is consistent with the metallicity
dispersion inferred from the width of the AGB in M32. The use of line width to
distinguish between blends involving many relatively faint stars, none of which
dominate the light output, and areas that are dominated by a single
intrinsically bright star could be extended to crowded environments in other
nearby galaxies.

This chapter presents some contributions of LIA for the future of HCI,
defending that using common sense knowledge is a possibility for improving HCI,
especially because people assign meaning to their messages based on their
common sense and, therefore, the use of this knowledge in developing user
interfaces can make them more intuitive to the end-user. Moreover, as common
sense knowledge varies from group to group of people, it can be used for
developing applications capable of giving different feedback for different
target groups, as the applications presented along this chapter illustrate,
allowing, in this way, interface personalization taking into account cultural
issues. For the purpose of using common sense knowledge in the development and
design of computer systems, it is necessary to provide an architecture that
allows it. This chapter presents LIAs approaches for common sense knowledge

emitters, such as fluorescing molecules or semiconductor quantum dots, located
near a metal nanostructure supporting surface plasmon. The primary mechanism of
cooperative emission in such systems is resonant energy transfer between
emitters and plasmons rather than the Dicke radiative coupling between
emitters. We identify two types of plasmonic coupling between the emitters, (i)
plasmon-enhanced radiative coupling and (ii) plasmon-assisted nonradiative
energy transfer, the competition between them governing the structure of system
eigenstates. Specifically, when emitters are removed by more than several nm
from the metal surface, the emission is dominated by three superradiant states
with the same quantum yield as a single emitter, resulting in a drastic
reduction of ensemble radiated energy, while at smaller distances cooperative
behavior is destroyed by nonradiative transitions. The crossover between two
regimes can be observed in distance dependence of ensemble quantum efficiency.
Our numerical calculations incorporating direct and plasmon-assisted
interactions between the emitters indicate that they do not destroy the
plasmonic Dicke effect.

and are closely related to the structure of nonequilibrium low-temperature
amorphous phases of matter. Most work has been done for random jammed packings
of spheres, and it is only recently that corresponding packings of nonspherical
particles (e.g., ellipsoids) have received attention. Here we report a study of
the maximally random jammed (MRJ) packings of binary superdisks and
monodispersed superballs whose shapes are defined by |x_1|^2p+...+|x_2|^2p<=1
with d = 2 and 3, respectively, where p is the deformation parameter with
values in the interval (0, infinity). We find that the MRJ densities of such
packings increase dramatically and nonanalytically as one moves away from the
circular-disk and sphere point. Moreover, the disordered packings are
hypostatic and the local arrangements of particles are necessarily nontrivially
correlated to achieve jamming. We term such correlated structures ""nongeneric"".
The degree of ""nongenericity"" of the packings is quantitatively characterized
by determining the fraction of local coordination structures in which the
central particles have fewer contacting neighbors than average. We also show
that such seemingly special packing configurations are counterintuitively not
rare. As the anisotropy of the particles increases, the fraction of rattlers
decreases while the minimal orientational order increases. These novel
characteristics result from the unique rotational symmetry breaking manner of
the particles.

methods, viz., the variational approximation (VA) for narrow ordinary solitons,
and various forms of the averaging method for broad solitons of both types, and
also the study of mobility of the solitons. Under the direct commensurability
(equal periods of the lattices, the family of ordinary solitons is similar to
its counterpart in the free space. The situation is different in the case of
the subharmonic commensurability, with L_{lin}=(1/2)L_{nonlin}, or
incommensurability. In those cases, there is an existence threshold for the
solitons, and the scaling relation between their amplitude and width is
different from that in the free space. GS families demonstrate a bistability,
unless the direct commensurability takes place. Specific scaling relations are
found for them too. Ordinary solitons can be readily set in motion by kicking.
GSs are mobile too, featuring inelastic collisions. The analytical
approximations are shown to be quite accurate, predicting correct scaling
relations for the soliton families in different cases. The stability of the
ordinary solitons is fully determined by the VK (Vakhitov-Kolokolov) criterion,

fermion fields. A suggestion is made that our universe is made of rational
numbers rather than being a continuum. To substantiate this proposal, the
reduced Yang-Mills equation is written in the form of an elliptic curve. The
normalization of the solution can be expressed in terms of the Weierstrass
function generically or in terms of the Dedekind function in the case of
3-brane. A way to define the gravitational field in the matrix model is
proposed with some new interpretation of the cosmological constant. The (first)
quantization of the system is done within the framework of non-commutative

generalized assignment problem (GAP) and its variants. An instance of the GAP
consists of a bipartite graph with jobs on one side and machines on the other.
Machines have capacities and edges have values and sizes; the goal is to
construct a welfare maximizing feasible assignment. In our model of private
valuations, motivated by impossibility results, the value and sizes on all
job-machine pairs are public information; however, whether an edge exists or
not in the bipartite graph is a job's private information.
  We study several variants of the GAP starting with matching. For the
unweighted version, we give an optimal strategyproof mechanism; for maximum
weight bipartite matching, however, we show give a 2-approximate strategyproof
mechanism and show by a matching lowerbound that this is optimal. Next we study
knapsack-like problems, which are APX-hard. For these problems, we develop a
general LP-based technique that extends the ideas of Lavi and Swamy to reduce
designing a truthful mechanism without money to designing such a mechanism for
the fractional version of the problem, at a loss of a factor equal to the
integrality gap in the approximation ratio. We use this technique to obtain
strategyproof mechanisms with constant approximation ratios for these problems.
We then design an O(log n)-approximate strategyproof mechanism for the GAP by
reducing, with logarithmic loss in the approximation, to our solution for the
value-invariant GAP. Our technique may be of independent interest for designing
truthful mechanisms without money for other LP-based problems.

density of target stars. The data transmission rates, operational cycles, and
target management requirements implied by this mission design have been
optimized and integrated into a comprehensive plan for science operations. The
commissioning phase completed all critical tasks and accomplished all
objectives within a week of the pre-launch plan. Since starting science, the
nominal data collection timeline has been interrupted by two safemode events,
several losses of fine point, and some small pointing adjustments. The most
important anomalies are understood and mitigated, so Kepler's technical
performance metrics have improved significantly over this period and the
prognosis for mission success is excellent. The Kepler data archive is
established and hosting data for the science team, guest observers, and public.
The first data sets to become publicly available include the monthly full-frame
images, dropped targets, and individual sources as they are published. Data are

concentric spherical shell-like structure of spherulites, centred on primary

out when the corresponding solubility limits in the liquid are successively
exceeded. It can be that the better-known sedimentation of microspherulites

fluorescence method at room temperature, 77 K using the diamond anvil cell
(DAC) up to 10 GPa in order to find appropriate media for use in low
temperature physics. The investigated media are a 1:1 mixture by volume of
Fluorinert FC-70 and FC-77, Daphne 7373 and 7474, NaCl, silicon oil
(polydimethylsiloxane), Vaseline, 2-propanol, glycerin, a 1:1 mixture by volume
of $n$-pentane and isopentane, a 4:1 mixture by volume of methanol and ethanol,
petroleum ether, nitrogen, argon and helium. The nonhydrostaticity of the
pressure is discussed from the viewpoint of the broadening effect of the ruby
$R_1$ fluorescence line. The $R_1$ line basically broadens above the
liquid-solid transition pressure at room temperature. However, the
nonhydrostatic effects do constantly develop in all the media from the
low-pressure region at low temperature. The relative strength of the
nonhydrostatic effects in the media at the low temperature region is discussed.
The broadening effect of the ruby $R_1$ line in the nitrogen, argon and helium
media are significantly small at 77 K, suggesting that the media are more
appropriate for cryogenic experiments under high pressure up to 10 GPa with the
DAC. The availability of the three media was also confirmed at 4.2 K.

matrices), for which a continuum of different choices are possible. We study
the conditions under which a change of the coefficient fields leads to an
equivalent Hamiltonian operator H, or to an equivalent energy operator E. In
this paper, we focus on the standard version of the gravitational Dirac
equation, but the non-uniqueness applies also to our alternative versions. We
find that the changes which lead to an equivalent operator H, or respectively
to an equivalent operator E, are determined by initial data, or respectively
have to make some point-dependent antihermitian matrix vanish. Thus, the vast
majority of the possible coefficient changes lead neither to an equivalent
operator H, nor to an equivalent operator E, whence a lack of uniqueness. We
show that even the Dirac energy spectrum is not unique.

is limited by a non-perfect match of current atmosphere spectra with our

responsible. By combining the observed photometry, the surface fluxes from
atmosphere models and the known distance of the system, we derive new mass,

crossover for the dephasing time $\tPh(T)$ from diffusive or ergodic 1D
($\tPh^{-1} \propto T^{2/3}, T^{1}$) to $0D$ behavior ($\tPh^{-1} \propto
T^{2}$) as $T$ drops below the Thouless energy $\ETh$. We provide a detailed
derivation of our results, based on an influence functional for quantum Nyquist
noise, and calculate all leading and subleading terms of the dephasing time in
the three regimes. Explicitly taking into account the Pauli blocking of the
Fermi sea in the metal allows us to describe the $0D$ regime on equal footing
as the others. The crossover to $0D$, predicted by Sivan, Imry and Aronov for
3D systems, has so far eluded experimental observation. We will show that for
$T \ll \ETh$, $0D$ dephasing governs not only the $T$-dependence for the smooth
part of the magnetoconductivity but also for the amplitude of the
Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations, which result only from electron paths
winding around the ring. This observation can be exploited to filter out and
eliminate contributions to dephasing from trajectories which do not wind around
the ring, which may tend to mask the $T^{2}$ behavior. Thus, the ring geometry
holds promise of finally observing the crossover to $0D$ experimentally.

extremely expensive, instruments provide only local measurements and
atmospheric modelling might represent a step ahead towards the search and

therefore an important benchmark test to evaluate the possibility to
discriminate sites on the same plateau. Our group8 has proven that the analyses

between the dust particles in this environment and the complex physics of dust
aggregate collisions. Here we present the results of a collision model, which
is based on laboratory experiments of these aggregates. We investigate the
maximum aggregate size and mass that can be reached by coagulation in
protoplanetary disks. We model the growth of dust aggregates at 1 AU at the
midplane at three different gas densities. We find that the evolution of the
dust does not follow the previously assumed growth-fragmentation cycles.
Catastrophic fragmentation hardly occurs in the three disk models. Furthermore
we see long lived, quasi-steady states in the distribution function of the
aggregates due to bouncing. We explore how the mass and the porosity change
upon varying the turbulence parameter and by varying the critical mass ratio of
dust particles. Particles reach Stokes numbers of roughly 10^-4 during the
simulations. The particle growth is stopped by bouncing rather than
fragmentation in these models. The final Stokes number of the aggregates is
rather insensitive to the variations of the gas density and the strength of
turbulence. The maximum mass of the particles is limited to approximately 1
gram (chondrule-sized particles). Planetesimal formation can proceed via the
turbulent concentration of these aerodynamically size-sorted chondrule-sized
particles.

analyzed theoretically. We first formulate a recipe which determines the Bloch
states of a one-dimensional (1D) ring from the Bloch states of an infinite 1D
crystal created by the periodic repetition of the ring. Using the recipe, we
derive an expression for the persistent current in a 1D ring made of an
insulator with an arbitrary valence band E(k). To find an exact result for a
specific insulator, we consider a 1D ring represented by a periodic lattice of
N identical sites with a single value of the on-site energy. If the Bloch
states in the ring are expanded over a complete set of N on-site Wannier
functions, the discrete on-site energy splits into the energy band. At full
filling, the band emulates the valence band of the band insulator and the ring
is insulating. It carries a persistent current equal to the product of N and
the derivative of the on-site energy with respect to the magnetic flux. This
current is not zero if one takes into account that the on-site Wannier function
and consequently the on-site energy of each ring site depend on magnetic flux.
To derive the current analytically, we expand all N Wannier functions of the
ring over the infinite basis of Wannier functions of the constituting infinite
1D crystal and eventually determine the crystal Wannier functions by a method
of localized atomic orbitals. Finally, we estimate the persistent current at
full filling in rings made of real band insulators (GaAs, Ge, InAs). The
current decays with the ring length exponentially due to the exponential decay
of the Wannier functions. In spite of that, it can be of measurable size.

to impose a sum-to-one (full additivity) constraint to the estimated source

central star. This dust is in many respects expected to be similar to the
zodiacal dust in the solar system. The ring displays a clear brightness
asymmetry, attributed to asymmetric scattering of the central starlight by the
circumstellar dust grains. Recent measurements show that the bright side of the
Fomalhaut ring is oriented away from us. This implies that the grains in this
system scatter most of the light in the backward direction, in sharp contrast
to the forward-scattering nature of the grains in the solar system. In this
letter, we show that grains considerably larger than those dominating the solar
system zodiacal dust cloud provide a natural explanation for the apparent
backward scattering behavior. In fact, we see the phases of the dust grains in
the same way as we can observe the phases of the Moon and other large solar
system bodies. We outline how the theory of the scattering behavior of
planetesimals can be used to explain the Fomalhaut dust properties. This
indicates that the Fomalhaut dust ring is dominated by very large grains. The
material orbiting Fomalhaut, which is at the transition between dust and
planetesimals, can, with respect to their optical behavior, best be described
as micro-asteroids.

1245 resonances in the nuclear data ensemble (NDE) for which they have been
reported. Random matrix theory (RMT) predicts for the Gaussian orthogonal
ensemble (GOE) that these widths should follow a \c{hi}^2 distribution having
one degree of freedom ({\nu}=1) - the Porter Thomas distribution (PTD). Careful
analysis of the {\Gamma}_{n}^2 values in the NDE rejects the validity of the
PTD with a statistical significance of at least 99.97% ({\nu}=0.801\pm0.052).
This striking disagreement with the RMT prediction is most likely due to the
inclusion of significant p-wave contamination to the supposedly pure s-wave
NDE. When an energy dependent threshold is used to remove the p-wave
contamination, the PTD is still rejected with a statistical significance of at
least 98.17% ({\nu}=1.217\pm0.092). Furthermore, examination of the primary
references for the NDE reveals that many resonances in most of the individual
data sets were selected using methods derived from RMT. Therefore, using the
full NDE data set to test RMT predictions seems highly questionable. These
results cast very serious doubt on claims that the NDE represents a striking
confirmation of RMT.

states and thin films of the three-dimensional topological insulator (3DTI).
Starting from an effective model for 3DTI based on the first principles
calculation [Zhang \emph{et al}, Nat. Phys. 5, 438 (2009)], we present
solutions for both the surface states in a semi-infinite boundary condition and
in the thin film with finite thickness. An effective continuous model was
derived for surface states and the thin film 3DTI. The coupling between
opposite topological surfaces and structure inversion asymmetry (SIA) give rise
to gapped Dirac hyperbolas with Rashba-like splittings in energy spectrum.
Besides, the SIA leads to asymmetric distributions of wavefunctions along the
film growth direction, making some branches in the energy spectra much harder
than others to be probed by light. These features agree well with the recent
angle-resolved photoemission spectra of Bi$_{2}$Se $_{3}$ films grown on SiC
substrate [Zhang et al, arXiv: 0911.3706]. More importantly, we use the
effective model to fit the experimental data and determine the model
parameters. The result indicates that the thin film Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ lies in
quantum spin Hall region based on the calculation of the Chern number and the
$Z_{2}$ invariant. In addition, strong SIA always intends to destroy the

braided commutative. By the Brzezinski--Militaru theorem, H(B^*)#D(B) is then a
Hopf algebroid over H(B^*). For B a particular Taft Hopf algebra at a 2p-th
root of unity, the construction is adapted to yield Yetter--Drinfeld module
algebras over the 2p^3-dimensional quantum group U_q(sl(2)). In particular, it
follows that Mat_p(C) is a braided commutative Yetter--Drinfeld
U_q(sl(2))-module algebra and Mat_p(U_q(sl(2))) is a Hopf algebroid over
Mat_p(C).
