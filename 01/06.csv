Shubik's famous ""dollar auction"" perhaps being the most widely known example.
Recently, some mainstream e-commerce web sites have apparently achieved the
same end on a much broader scale, by using ""pay-per-bid"" auctions to sell
items, from video games to bars of gold. In these auctions, bidders incur a
cost for placing each bid in addition to (or sometimes in lieu of) the winner's
final purchase cost. Thus even when a winner's purchase cost is a small
fraction of the item's intrinsic value, the auctioneer can still profit
handsomely from the bid fees. Our work provides novel analyses for these
auctions, based on both modeling and datasets derived from auctions at
Swoopo.com, the leading pay-per-bid auction site. While previous modeling work
predicts profit-free equilibria, we analyze the impact of information asymmetry
broadly, as well as Swoopo features such as bidpacks and the Swoop It Now
option specifically, to quantify the effects of imperfect information in these
auctions. We find that even small asymmetries across players (cheaper bids,
better estimates of other players' intent, different valuations of items,
committed players willing to play ""chicken"") can increase the auction duration
well beyond that predicted by previous work and thus skew the auctioneer's
profit disproportionately. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of a
dataset of thousands of live auctions we observed on Swoopo, which enables us
also to examine behavioral factors, such as the power of aggressive bidding.
Ultimately, our findings show that even with fully rational players, if players
overlook or are unaware any of these factors, the result is outsized profits
for pay-per-bid auctioneers.

labor to paid crowdsourcing projects. We also introduce a novel method for
estimating a worker's reservation wage--the smallest wage a worker is willing

that the reservation wages of a sample of workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk

$1.38/hour. At the median wage, the point elasticity of extensive labor supply
is 0.43. We discuss how to use our calibrated model to make predictions in
applied work. Two experimental tests of the model show that many workers
respond rationally to offered incentives. However, a non-trivial fraction of
subjects appear to set earnings targets. These ""target earners"" consider not
just the offered wage--which is what the rational model predicts--but also
their proximity to earnings goals. Interestingly, a number of workers clearly
prefer earning total amounts evenly divisible by 5, presumably because these

from spectral features of astrophysical or instrumental origin by studying its
spatial distribution. We demonstrate this approach by examining the recent
claim of 0912.0552 regarding the possible DM origin of the 2.5 keV line in
Chandra observations of the Milky Way satellite known as Willman 1. Our
conservative strategy is to adopt a relatively large dark mass for Willman 1
and relatively small dark masses for the comparison objects. We analyze
archival observations by XMM-Newton of M31 and Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy
(dSph) and Chandra observations of Sculptor dSph. By performing a conservative
analysis of X-ray spectra, we show the absence of a DM decay line with
parameters consistent with those of 0912.0552. For M31, the observations of the
regions between 10 and 20 kpc from the center, where the uncertainties in the
DM distribution are minimal, make a strong exclusion at the level above
10sigma. The minimal estimate for the amount of DM in the central 40 kpc of M31
is provided by the model of 0912.4133, assuming the stellar disk's mass to
light ratio ~8 and almost constant DM density within a core of 28 kpc. Even in
this case one gets an exclusion at 5.7sigma from central region of M31 whereas
modeling all processed data from M31 and Fornax produces more than 14sigma
exclusion. Therefore, despite possible systematic uncertainties, we exclude the
possibility that the spectral feature at ~2.5 keV found in 0912.0552 is a DM
decay line. We conclude, however, that the search for DM decay line, although
demanding prolonged observations of well-studied dSphs, M31 outskirts and other
similar objects, is rather promising, as the nature of a possible signal can be
checked. An (expected) non-observation of a DM decay signal in the planned
observations of Willman 1 should not discourage further dedicated observations.

discrepancies of up to 1.4$%$ below the base of the convection zone (compared
to discrepancies of less than 0.4$%$ with the old abundances), a convection
zone that is too shallow, and a convection zone helium abundance that is too

evaluate three changes to the models: early mass loss, accretion of low-Z
material, and convective overshoot. One goal of these attempts is to explore
models that could preserve the structure in the interior obtained with the old
abundances while accommodating the new abundances at the surface. Although the
mass-losing and accretion models show some improvement in agreement with
seismic constraints, a satisfactory resolution to the solar abundance problem
remains to be found. In addition, we perform a preliminary analysis of models
with the Caffau et al. (2008, 2009) abundances that shows that the sound speed

introducing the Continuum-Coupled Shell Model (CCSM) characterized by an
infinite wall placed very far and by an interaction for continuum coupling
constructed in a close relation to realistic shell-model interaction. Neutron
emission spectra from exotic oxygen isotopes are calculated by the
doorway-state approach in heavy-ion multi-nucleon transfer reactions. The
results agree with experiment remarkably well, as an evidence that the
continuum effects are stronger than $\sim$1 MeV, consistently with the shell
evolution in exotic nuclei. The results by this CCSM doorway-state approach are
compared with calculations on neutron-scattering resonance peaks made within
the CCSM phase-shift approach and also with those obtained in the Gamow shell
model, by taking the same interaction. Remarkable similarities in peak energies
and certain differences in widths are then obtained.

the complete flux density limited MOJAVE sample, comprising 135 radio-loud
AGNs. While extended emission is detected in the majority of the sources, about
7% of the sources exhibit only radio core emission. Many BL Lacs exhibit
extended radio power and kpc-scale morphology typical of powerful FRII jets,
while a substantial number of quasars possess radio powers intermediate between
FRIs and FRIIs. This poses challenges to the simple radio-loud unified scheme,
which links BL Lacs to FRIs and quasars to FRIIs. We find a significant
correlation between extended radio emission and pc-scale jet speeds: the more
radio powerful sources possess faster jets. This indicates that the 1.4 GHz (or
low frequency) radio emission is indeed related to jet kinetic power. Various
properties such as extended radio power and apparent pc-scale jet speeds vary
smoothly between different blazar subclasses, suggesting that, at least in
terms of radio jet properties, the distinction between quasars and BL Lac
objects, at an emission-line equivalent width of 5 Angstrom is essentially an
arbitrary one. Based on the assumption that the extended radio luminosity is
affected by the kpc-scale environment, we define the ratio of extended radio
power to absolute optical magnitude as a proxy for environmental effects.
Trends with this parameter suggest that the pc-scale jet speeds and the
pc-to-kpc jet misalignments are not affected by the large-scale environment,
but are more likely to depend upon factors intrinsic to the AGN, or its local
pc-scale environment. We suggest that some of the extremely misaligned MOJAVE
blazar jets could be ""hybrid"" morphology sources, with an FRI jet on one side
and an FRII jet on the other. (Abridged)

than the classical single file sub-diffusion $<(x_T)^2 > \sim t^{1/2}$ found
for uniformly distributed particles in an infinite space and in the absence of

$<(x_T)^2 > = {{\cal R} (1 - {\cal R})\over 2 N {\it r} ^2} $ where $2 N$ is
the (large) number of particles in the system, ${\cal R}$ is a single particle
reflection coefficient obtained from the single particle Green function and

discussed from the view that Zurek's derivation of the measurement axioms

operating in the Heii ionization zone. Theory predicts an overlap region in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram between instability regions, where 'hybrid' stars
pulsating in both types of modes should exist. The two types of modes with
properties governed by different portions of the stellar interior provide
complementary model constraints. Among the known $\gamma$ Dor and $\delta$ Sct

the frequency spectra are so rich that there are practically no pure $\delta$

a 489 ks observation using the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating. The
spectrum provides a rich set of diagnostics for electron temperature T_e,
electron density N_e, hydrogen column density N_H, relative elemental
abundances and velocities and reveals its source in 3 distinct regions of the
stellar atmosphere: the stellar corona, the accretion shock, and a very large
extended volume of warm postshock plasma. The presence of Mg XII, Si XIII, and
Si XIV emission lines in the spectrum requires coronal structures at ~10 MK.
Lower temperature lines (e.g., from O VIII, Ne IX, and Mg XI) formed at 2.5 MK
appear more consistent with emission from an accretion shock. He-like Ne IX
line ratio diagnostics indicate that T_e = 2.50 +/- 0.25 MK and N_e = 3.0 +/-
0.2 x 10^(12) cm^(-3) in the shock. These values agree well with standard
magnetic accretion models. However, the Chandra observations significantly
diverge from current model predictions for the postshock plasma. This gas is
expected to cool radiatively, producing O VII as it flows into an increasingly
dense stellar atmosphere. Surprisingly, O VII indicates N_e = 5.7
^(+4.4}_(-1.2) x 10^(11) cm^(-3), five times lower than N_e in the accretion
shock itself, and ~7 times lower than the model prediction. We estimate that
the postshock region producing O VII has roughly 300 times larger volume, and
30 times more emitting mass than the shock itself. Apparently, the shocked
plasma heats the surrounding stellar atmosphere to soft X-ray emitting
temperatures and supplies this material to nearby large magnetic structures --
which may be closed magnetic loops or open magnetic field leading to mass
outflow. (Abridged)

systems on the sphere $S^2$ with the symmetries of each Platonic polyhedra.
Although some of these systems are known, their expression is extremely
complicated; we try here to find the simplest possible expressions for this
kind of dynamical systems. Even in the simplest cases it is not easy to prove
their integrability by direct computation of the first integrals, therefore, we
make use of numerical methods to provide evidences of integrability; namely, by
analyzing their Poincar\'e sections (surface sections). In this way we find
three systems with platonic symmetries, one for each class of equivalent
Platonic polyhedra: tetrahedral, exahedral-octahedral,
dodecahedral-icosahedral, showing evidences of integrability. The proof of
integrability and the construction of the first integrals are left for further
works. As an outline of the possible developments if the integrability of these
systems will be proved, we show how to build from them new integrable systems
in dimension three and, from these, superintegrable systems in dimension four
corresponding to superintegrable interactions among four points on a line, in
analogy with the systems with dihedral symmetry treated in a previous article.
A common feature of these possibly integrable systems is, besides to the rich
symmetry group on the configuration manifold, the partition of the latter into
dynamically separated regions showing a simple structure of the potential in
their interior. This observation allows to conjecture integrability for a class
of Hamiltonian systems in the Euclidean spaces.

presence of the observational Point Spread Function (PSF) that smears out the
image. The PSF must therefore be known for each galaxy to a high accuracy.
However, for several reasons, the PSF is usually wavelength dependent,
therefore the differences between the spectral energy distribution of the
observed objects introduces further complexity. In this paper we investigate
the effect of the wavelength-dependence of the PSF, focusing on instruments in
which the PSF size is dominated by the diffraction-limit of the telescope and
which use broad-band filters for shape measurement.
  We first calculate biases on cosmological parameter estimation from cosmic
shear when the stellar PSF is used uncorrected. Using realistic galaxy and star
spectral energy distributions and populations and a simple three-component
circular PSF we find that the colour-dependence must be taken into account for
the next generation of telescopes. We then consider two different methods for
removing the effect (i) the use of stars of the same colour as the galaxies and
(ii) estimation of the galaxy spectral energy distribution using multiple
colours and using a telescope model for the PSF. We find that both of these
methods correct the effect to levels below the tolerances required for per-cent
level measurements of dark energy parameters. Comparison of the two methods
favours the template-fitting method because its efficiency is less dependent on
galaxy redshift than the broad-band colour method and takes full advantage of
deeper photometry.

optical Kubo sum rule in the cuprates. We compute conductivities, optical
integrals W, and \Delta W between superconducting and normal states for 2-D
systems with lattice dispersion typical of the cuprates for four different
models -- a dirty BCS model, a single Einstein boson model, a marginal Fermi
liquid model, and a collective boson model with a feedback from
super-conductivity on a collective boson. The goal of the paper is two-fold.
First, we analyze the dependence of W on the upper cut-off w_c placed on the
optical integral because in experiments W is measured up to frequencies of
order bandwidth. For a BCS model, the Kubo sum rule is almost fully reproduced
at w_c equal to the bandwidth. But for other models only 70%-80% of Kubo sum
rule is obtained up to this scale and even less so for \Delta W, implying that
the Kubo sum rule has to be applied with caution. Second, we analyze the sign
of \Delta W. In all models we studied \Delta W is positive at small w_c, then
crosses zero and approaches a negative value at large w_c, i.e. the optical
integral in a superconductor is smaller than in a normal state. The point of
zero crossing, however, increases with the interaction strength and in a
collective boson model becomes comparable to the bandwidth at strong coupling.
We argue that this model exhibits the behavior consistent with that in the
cuprates.

free-fall time, as observed for all local star-forming systems and implied by
the Kennicutt-Schmidt law, they cannot be disrupted. Only if clumps convert
most of their mass to stars in a few free-fall times can feedback produce
significant gas expulsion. We consider whether such rapid star formation is
likely in high-redshift giant clumps.

constituent, cold dark matter. Almost impossible to observe, dark matter can be
studied effectively by means of simulation and there is probably no other
research field where simulation has led to so much progress in the last decade.
Cosmological N-body simulations are an essential tool for evolving density
perturbations in the nonlinear regime. Simulating the formation of large-scale
structures in the universe, however, is still a challenge due to the enormous
dynamic range in spatial and temporal coordinates, and due to the enormous
computer resources required. The dynamic range is generally dealt with by the
hybridization of numerical techniques. We deal with the computational
requirements by connecting two supercomputers via an optical network and make
them operate as a single machine. This is challenging, if only for the fact
that the supercomputers of our choice are separated by half the planet, as one
is located in Amsterdam and the other is in Tokyo. The co-scheduling of the two
computers and the 'gridification' of the code enables us to achieve a 90%
efficiency for this distributed intercontinental supercomputer.

the orbital content, intrinsic shape, and orientation. The dissipationless
remnants are typically prolate-triaxial, dominated by box orbits within r_c ~
1.5Reff, and by tube orbits in their outer parts. As the gas fraction
increases, the box orbits within r_c are increasingly replaced by a population
of short axis tubes (z-tubes) with near zero net rotation, and the remnants
become progressively more oblate and round. The long axis tube (x-tube) orbits
are highly streaming and relatively insensitive to the gas fraction, implying
that their angular momentum is retained from the dynamically cold initial
conditions. Outside r_c, the orbital structure is essentially unchanged by the
gas. The 15-20% gas remnants often display disk-like kinematically distinct
cores (KDCs). These remnants show an interesting resemblance, in both their
velocity maps and intrinsic orbital structure, to the KDC galaxy NGC4365 (van
den Bosch et al. 2008). At 30-40% gas, the remnants are rapidly rotating, with
sharp embedded disks on ~ 1Reff scales. We predict a characteristic, physically
intuitive orbital structure for 1:1 disk merger remnants, with a distinct
transition between 1 and 3Reff that will be readily observable with combined
data from the 2D kinematics surveys SAURON and SMEAGOL.

a possibility of multiple background point sources can not be completely
rejected with a limited angular resolution. If it is diffuse, the flat
continuum indicates that X-rays arise by the non-thermal electrons in the

models can be rejected from the necessary electron energy and X-ray spectral

ultra-relativistic (several tens MeV) electrons can explain the energy and the

heating from massive stars on the evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs)
and their star formation efficiency (SFE). We find that the star-forming
regions within the GMCs are invariably formed by gravitational contraction.
After an initial period of contraction, the collapsing clouds begin forming
stars, whose feedback evaporates part of the clouds' mass, opposing the
continuing accretion from the infalling gas. The competition of accretion
against dense gas consumption by star formation (SF) and evaporation by the
feedback, regulates the clouds' mass and energy balance, as well as their SFE.
We find that, in the presence of feedback, the clouds attain levels of the SFE
that are consistent at all times with observational determinations for regions
of comparable SF rates (SFRs). However, we observe that the dense gas mass is
larger in general in the presence of feedback, while the total (dense gas +
stars) is nearly insensitive to the presence of feedback, suggesting that the
total mass is determined by the accretion, while the feedback inhibits mainly
the conversion of dense gas to stars. The factor by which the SFE is reduced
upon the inclusion of feedback is a decreasing function of the cloud's mass,
for clouds of size ~ 10 pc. This naturally explains the larger observed SFEs of
massive-star forming regions. We also find that the clouds may attain a
pseudo-virialized state, with a value of the virial mass very similar to the
actual cloud mass. However, this state differs from true virialization in that
the clouds are the center of a large-scale collapse, continuously accreting
mass, rather than being equilibrium entities.

as determinants of elements of the centralizer algebra of a matrix, providing a
complete description of this set in terms of the class type of the matrix.
  Several results are established concerning the commuting of nilpotent
classes. Classes which are represented in the centralizer of every nilpotent
matrix are classified--this result holds over any field. Nilpotent classes are
parametrized by partitions; we find pairs of partitions whose corresponding
nilpotent classes commute over some finite fields, but not over others. We
conclude by classifying all pairs of classes, parametrized by two-part
partitions, that commute. Our results on nilpotent classes complement work of

inter-arm population. We infer an arm to inter-arm density contrast of 4. The
surface flux in diffuse X-rays is correlated with the inferred pre-shock
density, indicating that the warm interstellar medium is pressurised by the hot
X-ray plasma. We also find that the interstellar medium in the nuclear region

rate of one per 70-150 yr for the nuclear ($R<300 $pc) region. On the basis of

the realization of several scalable device applications. However, precise
control over the network electronic transport is challenging due to i) an often
uncontrollable interplay between network coverage and its topology and ii) the
inherent electrical heterogeneity of the constituent SWNTs. In this letter, we
use template-assisted fluidic assembly of SWCNT networks to explore the effect
of geometric confinement on the network topology. Heterogeneous SWCNT networks
dip-coated onto sub-micron wide ultra-thin polymer channels exhibit a topology
that becomes increasingly aligned with decreasing channel width and thickness.
Experimental scale coarse-grained computations of interacting SWCNTs show that
the effect is a reflection of an aligned topology that is no longer dependent
on the network density, which in turn emerges as a robust knob that can induce
semiconductor-to-metallic transitions in the network response. Our study
demonstrates the effectiveness of directed assembly on channels with varying
degrees of confinement as a simple tool to tailor the conductance of the

oriented spanning tree with at least $k$ leaves, we obtain an algorithm solving
the problem in time $2^{O(\sqrt{k} \log k)} n+ n^{O(1)}$ on directed graphs
whose underlying undirected graph excludes some fixed graph $H$ as a minor. For
the special case when the input directed graph is planar, the running time can
be improved to $2^{O(\sqrt{k})}n + n^{O(1)}$. The second example is a
generalization of the {\sc Directed Hamiltonian Path} problem, namely {\sc
$k$-Internal Out-Branching}, which is to find an oriented spanning tree with at
least $k$ internal vertices. We obtain an algorithm solving the problem in time
$2^{O(\sqrt{k} \log k)} + n^{O(1)}$ on directed graphs whose underlying
undirected graph excludes some fixed apex graph $H$ as a minor. Finally, we
observe that for any $\epsilon>0$, the {\sc $k$-Directed Path} problem is
solvable in time $O((1+\epsilon)^k n^{f(\epsilon)})$, where $f$ is some
function of $\ve$.
  Our methods are based on non-trivial combinations of obstruction theorems for
undirected graphs, kernelization, problem specific combinatorial structures and
a layering technique similar to the one employed by Baker to obtain PTAS for
planar graphs.

residual range of protons passing through the patient's body. Nuclear emulsion
films interleaved with tissue equivalent absorbers can be fruitfully used to
reconstruct proton tracks with very high precision. The first prototype of a
nuclear emulsion based detector has been conceived, constructed and tested with
a therapeutic proton beam at PSI. The scanning of the emulsions has been
performed at LHEP in Bern, where a fully automated microscopic scanning
technology has been developed for the OPERA experiment on neutrino
oscillations. After track reconstruction, the first promising experimental
results have been obtained by imaging a simple phantom made of PMMA with a step
of 1 cm. A second phantom with five 5 x 5 mm^2 section aluminum rods located at

new features of the local structure of a real scalar quantum field theory in a
strongly causal spacetime. In particular we use the properties of the
exponential map to set up a local version of a bulk-to-boundary correspondence.
The bulk is a suitable subset of a geodesic neighbourhood of any but fixed
point p of the underlying background, while the boundary is a part of the
future light cone having p as its own tip. In this regime, we provide a novel
notion for the extended *-algebra of Wick polynomials on the said cone and, on
the one hand, we prove that it contains the information of the bulk counterpart
via an injective *-homomorphism while, on the other hand, we associate to it a
distinguished state whose pull-back in the bulk is of Hadamard form. The main
advantage of this point of view arises if one uses the universal properties of
the exponential map and of the light cone in order to show that, for any two
given backgrounds M and M' and for any two subsets of geodesic neighbourhoods
of two arbitrary points, it is possible to engineer the above procedure such
that the boundary extended algebras are related via a restriction homomorphism.
This allows for the pull-back of boundary states in both spacetimes and, thus,
to set up a machinery which permits the comparison of expectation values of
local field observables in M and M'.

analyzing the Einstein equations in a semiclassical fashion. More precisely, we
shall show that, at least on small intervals of time, solutions for this
interacting system exist. This result will be achieved providing an iteration
scheme and showing that the series, obtained starting from the massless
solution, converges in the appropriate Banach space. The quantum states with
good ultraviolet behavior (Hadamard property), used in order to obtain the
backreaction, will be completely determined by their form on the initial
surface if chosen to be lightlike. Furthermore, on small intervals of time,
they do not influence the behavior of the exact solution. On large intervals of
time the situation is more complicated but, if the spacetime is expanding, we
shall show that the end-point of the evolution does not depend strongly on the
quantum state, because, in this limit, the expectation values of the matter
fields responsible for the backreaction do not depend on the particular
homogeneous Hadamard state at all. Finally, we shall comment on the
interpretation of the semiclassical Einstein equations for this kind of
problems. Although the fluctuations of the expectation values of pointlike
fields diverge, if the spacetime and the quantum state have a large spatial
symmetry and if we consider the smeared fields on regions of large spatial
volume, they tend to vanish. Assuming this point of view the semiclassical
Einstein equations become more reliable.

expansion. For the disordered system, the numerical data and the relevant
detailed finite-size scaling analysis along the lines of the two well-known

the field-theoretically predicted scenario of logarithmic corrections. A

spin coherence time of 40 ps was observed at temperature of 7 K in p-type CdTe

coherence time, which can be as long as 2.5 ns at 7 K in optimally doped

the concentration of electrons is the most pronounced at low temperatures but
it has a sizable effect also at room temperature. The optimal concentration of
electrons to achieve the longest spin coherence time is 17-times higher in CdTe
than in GaAs and the maximal low-temperature value of the spin coherence time
in CdTe is 70 times shorter than the corresponding value in GaAs. Our data can
help in cross-checking the predictions of various theoretical models that were

ULX1 to be three times more variable than ULX2 in the 0.3--10 keV band, even
though ULX2 is brighter. Indeed, ULX1 exhibits a power density spectrum that is
consistent with the canonical high state or very high/steep power law state,
but not the canonical low state. The 0.3--10 keV emission of ULX1 is
predominantly non-thermal, and may be related to the very high state. We also
fitted the ULX spectra with disc blackbody, slim disc and convolution
Comptonization (SIMPL x DISKBB) models. The brightest ULX spectra are usually
described by a two emission components (disc blackbody + Comptonized
component); however, the SIMPL model results in a single emission component,
and may help determine whether the well known soft excess is a feature of ULX
spectra or an artifact of the two-component model. The SIMPL models were
rejected for ULX3 (and also for the black hole + Wolf-Rayet binary IC10 X-1);
hence, we infer that the observed soft-excesses are genuine features of ULX
emission spectra. We use an extended corona scenario to explain the soft excess
seen in all the highest quality ULX spectra, and provide a mechanism for
stellar mass black holes to exhibit super-Eddington luminosities while
remaining locally sub-Eddington.

ordered phase with random forcing, as is observed in the vibrating system, and
that the amount of the suppression is proportional to the degree of

R^4's define a generalized embedding into a space which is K-theoretic
equivalent to a noncommutative Banach algebra. Furthermore, we show that a
factor III von Neumann algebra is naturally related with nonstandard smoothing
of a small R^4 and conjecture that this factor is the unique hyperfinite factor
III_1. We also show how an exotic smoothing of a small R^4 is related to the
Drinfeld-Turaev (deformation) quantization of the Poisson algebra
(X(S,SL(2,C),{,}) of complex functions on the space of flat connections
X(S,SL(2,C) over a surface S, and that the result of this quantization is the
skein algebra (K_t(S),[,]) for the deformation parameter t=exp(h/4). This skein
algebra is retrieved as a II_1 factor of horocycle flows which is Morita
equivalent to the II_infty factor von Neumann algebra which in turn determines
the unique factor III_1 as crossed product. Moreover, the structure of Casson
handles determine the factor II_1 algebra too. Thus, the quantization of the
Poisson algebra of closed circles in a leaf of the codimension 1 foliation of
S^3 gives rise to the factor III_1 associated with exotic smoothness of R^4.

possibly infinite, unknown connected graph or in an unknown connected terrain

speed of the agent, stop it, or even move it back and forth, as long as the
walk of the agent in each segment of its route is continuous, does not leave it

same time in some node or in some point inside an edge of the graph, while
meeting in a terrain means that both agents must be at the same time in some
point of the terrain. Does there exist a deterministic algorithm that allows
any two agents to meet in any unknown environment in spite of this very
powerfull adversary? We give deterministic rendezvous algorithms for agents
starting at arbitrary nodes of any anonymous connected graph (finite or
infinite) and for agents starting at any interior points with rational
coordinates in any closed region of the plane with path-connected interior.
While our algorithms work in a very general setting ? agents can, indeed, meet
almost everywhere ? we show that none of the above few limitations imposed on
the environment can be removed. On the other hand, our algorithm also
guarantees the following approximate rendezvous for agents starting at
arbitrary interior points of a terrain as above: agents will eventually get at
an arbitrarily small positive distance from each other.

core-collapse supernovae. It is extremely sensitive to the dynamics of the
explosion and therefore can be used to indirectly probe the explosion scenario.
The young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A is to date the only source of
gamma-ray lines from 44Ti decay. The emission flux has been measured by
CGRO/COMPTEL, BeppoSAX/PDS and INTEGRAL/IBIS. The high-resolution spectrometer
SPI on-board the INTEGRAL satellite can provide spectrometric information about
the emission. The line profiles reflect the kinematics of the 44Ti in
Cassiopeia A and can thus place constraints on its nucleosynthesis and
potentially on the associated explosion process. Using 4 years of data from
INTEGRAL/SPI, we have searched for the gamma-ray signatures from the decay of
the 44Ti isotope. The overwhelming instrumental background noise required an
accurate modelling and a solid assessment of the systematic errors in the
analysis. Due to the strong variability of the instrumental background noise,
it has not been possible to extract the two lines at 67.9 and 78.4keV.
Regarding the high-energy line at 1157.0keV, no significant signal is seen in
the 1140-1170keV band, thereby suggesting that the line signal from Cassiopeia
A is broadened by the Doppler effect. From our spectrum, we derive a ~ 500km/s
lower limit at 2sigma on the expansion velocity of the 44Ti ejecta. Our result
does not allow us to constrain the location of 44Ti since the velocities
involved throughout the remnant, derived from optical and X-ray studies, are
all far above our lower limit.

that was recently introduced as a kinetically non-linear generalisation of the
well known harmonic category of multiscalar fields over a supporting brane
wordsheet in a target space with a curved Riemannian metric. Like the perfectly
harmonious case of which a familiar example is provided by ordinary barotropic
perfect fluids, another important subcategory is the simply harmonious case,
for which it is shown that as well as ``wiggle'' modes of the underlying brane
world sheet, and sound type longitudinal modes, there will also be transverse
shake modes that propagate at the speed of light. Models of this type are shown
to arise from a non-Abelian generalisation of the Witten mechanism for
conducting string formation by ordinary scalar fields with a suitable quartic
self coupling term in the action.

for determining its evolution. Escape can be driven by upward thermal
conduction of energy deposited well below the exobase, as well as by
non-thermal processes produced by energy deposited in the exobase region.
Recent applications of a model for escape driven by upward thermal conduction,
called the slow hydrodynamic escape model, have resulted in surprisingly large
loss rates for the thick atmosphere of Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Based on a
molecular kinetic simulation of the exobase region, these rates appear to be
orders of magnitude too large. Because of the large amount of Cassini data
already available for Titan's upper atmosphere and the wealth of data expected
within the next decade for the atmospheres of Pluto, Mars, and extrasolar
planets, accurately determining present escape rates is critical for
understanding their evolution. Therefore, the slow hydrodynamic model is
evaluated here. It is shown that such a model cannot give a reliable
description of the atmospheric temperature profile unless it is coupled to a
molecular kinetic description of the exobase region. Therefore, the present
escape rates for Titan and Pluto must be re-evaluated using atmospheric models
described in this paper.

Must a finite stress be
applied in order to induce flow? Or, instead, do all solids only look rigid on
some finite timescales and eventually flow if an infinitesimal shear stress is
applied? Surprisingly, these simple questions are a matter of debate and
definite answers are still lacking. Here we show that solidity is only a
time-scale dependent notion: equilibrium states of matter that break
spontaneously translation invariance, e.g. crystals, flow if even an
infinitesimal stress is applied. However, they do so in a way inherently
different from ordinary liquids since their viscosity diverges for vanishing
shear stress with an essential singularity. We find an ultra-slow decrease of
the shear stress as a function of the shear rate, which explains the apparent
yield stress identified in rheological flow curves. Furthermore, we suggest
that an alternating shear of frequency $\omega$ and amplitude $\gamma$ should
lead to a dynamic phase transition line in the ($\omega$,$\gamma$) plane, from
a 'flowing' to a 'non-flowing' phase. Finally, we apply our results to
crystals, show the corresponding microscopic process leading to flow and
discuss possible experimental investigations.

the edges is found to be absolutely crucial in defining the size of the

changed from the sp^2 to the sp^3 type. The H-vacancy defects also influence
the size of the gap depending on the number of defects and their distribution
between the two sides of the graphane plane. Further, the H-vacancy defects
induced on one side of the graphane plane and placed on the neighboring carbon
atoms are found to be the source of ferromagnetism which is distinguished by
the high stability of the state with a large spin number in comparison to that
of the singlet state and is expected to persist even at room temperatures.
However, the ferromagnetic ordering of the spins is obtained to be limited by
the concentration of H-vacancy defects and ordering would be preserved if

a parameterized family of waveforms requires, in general, the numerical
maximization of a data-dependent function of the signal parameters. Due to
noise in the data, the function to be maximized is often highly multi-modal
with numerous local maxima. Searching for the global maximum then becomes
computationally expensive, which in turn can limit the scientific scope of the
search. Stochastic optimization is one possible approach to reducing
computational costs in such applications. We report results from a first
investigation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method in this context.
The method is applied to a testbed motivated by the problem of detection and
estimation of a binary inspiral signal. Our results show that PSO works well in
the presence of high multi-modality, making it a viable candidate method for
further applications in GW data analysis.

connection between models of mixtures of immiscible fluids at different length
and time scales. We start from the Cahn-Hilliard model of spinodal
decomposition in a binary fluid mixture under flow from which we derive the
coarse-grained description. The crucial step in this procedure is to identify
the relevant coarse-grained variables and find the appropriate mapping which
expresses them in terms of the more microscopic variables. In order to capture
the physics of the Doi-Ohta level, we introduce the interfacial width as an
additional variable at that level. In this way, we account for the stretching
of the interface under flow and derive analytically the convective behavior of
the relevant coarse-grained variables, which in the long wavelength limit
recovers the familiar phenomenological Doi-Ohta model. In addition, we obtain
the expression for the interfacial tension in terms of the Cahn-Hilliard
parameters as a direct result of the developed coarse-graining procedure.
Finally, by analyzing the numerical results obtained from the simulations on
the Cahn-Hilliard level, we discuss that dissipative processes at the Doi-Ohta
level are of the same origin as in the Cahn-Hilliard model. The way to estimate
the interface relaxation times of the Doi-Ohta model from the underlying
morphology dynamics simulated at the Cahn-Hilliard level is established.
