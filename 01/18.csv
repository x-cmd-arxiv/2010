Each of the confidential messages is intended for one of the receivers but
needs to be kept perfectly secret from the other, and the common message is

secret dirty-paper coding with Gaussian superposition coding achieves the

approaching the quantum puzzle with a Zen-like ""beginner's mind"" in order to
try to envision what the pure formalism might be saying about quantum reality,
even if that journey leads to a strange place. It is argued that the
transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics (TI), appropriately
interpreted, shares the same motivation and achieves much more, with far fewer
conceptual perplexities, by taking into account heretofore overlooked features
of the quantum formalism itself (i.e. advanced states). In particular, TI does
not need to talk about brain states, consciousness, or observers (rational or
otherwise). In its possibilist variant (""PTI""), it shares the realist virtues
of treating state vector branches as genuine dynamical entities, without having
to explain how or why all of their associated outcomes actually happen (they
don't), how to account for a plenitude of counterpart observers in some
coherent notion of trans-temporal identity of the bifurcating observers
(observers don't bifurcate in TI), nor how the certainty of all outcomes could
be consistent with any coherent theory of probability, let alone the Born
probability (the Born probability emerges naturally in TI). In short, TI is
precisely the one-world interpretation Kent is looking for in his (2010).

in order to study the nanoscale self-assembly of complex (typically aperiodic)

positions of points in the Sierpinski triangle. More recently, Lathrop, Lutz,

""strict"" sense in which tiles are not allowed to appear at positions outside
the target structure. Here we investigate the strict self-assembly of sets that
approximate the Sierpinski triangle. We show that every set that does strictly
self-assemble disagrees with the Sierpinski triangle on a set with fractal
dimension at least that of the Sierpinski triangle (roughly 1.585), and that no
subset of the Sierpinski triangle with fractal dimension greater than 1
strictly self-assembles. We show that our bounds are tight, even when
restricted to supersets of the Sierpinski triangle, by presenting a strict
self-assembly that adds communication fibers to the fractal structure without
disturbing it. To verify this strict self-assembly we develop a generalization
of the local determinism method of Soloveichik and Winfree.

limit case $p=q$. We take our investigation to the simple $d$-dimensional
lattices for $d=1,2,3,4,5$ and fit $p,q$-binomial distributions to our data,
some of which are exact but most are sampled. For $d=1$ and $d=5$ the
magnetisation distributions are remarkably well-fitted by $p,q$-binomial
distributions. For $d=4$ we are only slightly less successful, while for
$d=2,3$ we see some deviations (with exceptions!) between the $p,q$-binomial
and the Ising distribution. We begin the paper by giving results on the
behaviour of the $p,q$-distribution and its moment growth exponents given a
certain parameterization of $p,q$. Since the moment exponents are known for the
Ising model (or at least approximately for $d=3$) we can predict how $p,q$
should behave and compare this to our measured $p,q$. The results speak in
favour of the $p,q$-binomial distribution's correctness regarding their general
behaviour in comparison to the Ising model. The full extent to which they
correctly model the Ising distribution is not settled though.

magnetic dipole coupling among the metallic wire pairs of enantiomeric

\lambda/30 thick, a linearly polarized wave is converted to its cross
polarization with a resonant polarization conversion efficiency (PCE) of over
90%. Meanwhile, the axial ratio of the transmitted wave is better than 40 dB.
It is demonstrated that the chirality in the propagation direction makes this
efficient cross-polarization conversion possible. The transversely isotropic
property of this polarization rotator is also experimentally verified. The
optical activity of the present structure is about 2700 degree/\lambda, which

simulates the full evolution of a relativistic heavy-ion collision from the
initial hard scatterings string formation through the dynamical deconfinement
phase transition to the quark gluon plasma (QGP), to the hadronization and to
subsequent interactions in the hadronic phase. The transport theoretical
description of quarks and gluons is based on a dynamical quasiparticle model
for partons matched to reproduce recent lattice QCD results in thermodynamic
equilibrium. The transition from partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom is
described by covariant transition rates for the fusion of quark-antiquark pairs
or three quarks (antiquarks). Studying Pb+Pb reactions from 40 to 158 A GeV, we
find that at most 40% of the collision energy is stored in the dynamics of the
partons. This implies that a large fraction of non-partonic, i.e. hadronic or
string-like matter, which can be viewed as a hadronic corona, is present in
these reactions, thus neither hadronic nor purely partonic models can be
employed to extract physical conclusions in comparing model results with data.
On the other hand, comparing the PHSD results to those of the Hadron-String
Dynamics (HSD) approach without the phase transition to QGP, we observe that
the existence of the partonic phase has a sizeable influence on the transverse
mass distribution of final kaons due to the repulsive partonic mean fields and
initial partonic scattering. Furthermore, we find a significant effect of the
QGP on the production of multi-strange antibaryons due to a slightly enhanced
s+sbar pair production in the partonic phase from massive time-like gluon decay
and to a more abundant formation of strange antibaryons in the hadronization
process.

discretisations of the linearized rotating shallow-water equations using the

geometry. A discrete Helmholtz decomposition of the functions in the velocity
space based on potentials taken from the pressure space is used to provide a
complete description of the numerical wave propagation for the discretised
equations. In the $f$-plane case, this decomposition is used to obtain
decoupled equations for the geostrophic modes, the inertia-gravity modes, and
the inertial oscillations. As has been noticed previously, the geostrophic
modes are steady. The Helmholtz decomposition is used to show that the
resulting inertia-gravity wave equation is third-order accurate in space. In
general the \pdgp finite element pair is second-order accurate, so this leads
to very accurate wave propagation. It is further shown that the only spurious
modes supported by this discretisation are spurious inertial oscillations which
have frequency $f$, and which do not propagate. The Helmholtz decomposition
also allows a simple derivation of the quasi-geostrophic limit of the
discretised $P1_{DG}$-$P2$ equations in the $\beta$-plane case, resulting in a
Rossby wave equation which is also third-order accurate.

used to define LINERs as a class and constrain non-stellar photoionization
models for LINERs. Therefore, our energy budget test is a self-consistency
check of the idea that the observed emission lines are powered by an AGN. We
determine the ionizing luminosities and photon rates by integrating the
observed SEDs and by scaling a template SED. Even if all ionizing photons are
absorbed by the line-emitting gas, more than half of our LINERs suffer from a
deficit of ionizing photons. In 1/3 of LINERs the deficit is severe. If only
10% of the ionizing photons are absorbed by the gas, there is an ionizing
photon deficit in 85% of LINERs. We disfavor the possibility that additional
electromagnetic power, either obscured or emitted in the unobservable far-UV
band, is available from the AGN. We consider other power sources such as
mechanical heating by compact jets and photoionization by young or old stars.
Photoionization by young stars may be important in a small fraction of cases.
Mechanical heating provides enough power in most cases but it is not clear how
this power is transferred to the emission-line gas. Photoionization by post-AGB
stars is an important power source; it provides more ionizing photons that the
AGN in more than half of the LINERs and enough ionizing photons to power the
emission lines in 1/3 of the LINERs. It appears likely that the emission-line
spectra of LINERs obtained from the ground include the sum of emission from
different regions where different power sources dominate.

maps with 1.4' angular resolution made with data from the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT). The observations cover 228 square degrees of the southern sky,
in a 4.2-degree-wide strip centered on declination 53 degrees South. The CMB at
arcminute angular scales is particularly sensitive to the Silk damping scale,
to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect from galaxy clusters, and to emission by
radio sources and dusty galaxies. After masking the 108 brightest point sources
in our maps, we estimate the power spectrum between 600 < \ell < 8000 using the
adaptive multi-taper method to minimize spectral leakage and maximize use of
the full data set. Our absolute calibration is based on observations of Uranus.
To verify the calibration and test the fidelity of our map at large angular
scales, we cross-correlate the ACT map to the WMAP map and recover the WMAP
power spectrum from 250 < ell < 1150. The power beyond the Silk damping tail of
the CMB is consistent with models of the emission from point sources. We
quantify the contribution of SZ clusters to the power spectrum by fitting to a
model normalized at sigma8 = 0.8. We constrain the model's amplitude ASZ < 1.63
(95% CL). If interpreted as a measurement of sigma8, this implies sigma8^SZ <
0.86 (95% CL) given our SZ model. A fit of ACT and WMAP five-year data jointly
to a 6-parameter LCDM model plus terms for point sources and the SZ effect is
consistent with these results.

limited regime increases linearly with the number of transmit antenna and the

utilizing the behavior of the corresponding Lagrangian under infinitesimal

the initial mass function (IMF) of stars is universal, or instead sensitive to
the initial conditions of star formation. The distinction is of critical
importance: the IMF influences most of the observable properties of stellar
populations and galaxies, and detecting variations in the IMF could provide
deep insights into the process by which stars form. In this review, we take a
critical look at the case for IMF variations, with a view towards whether other
explanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the field, local
young clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that the
vast majority were drawn from a ""universal"" IMF: a power-law of Salpeter index
($\Gamma=1.35$) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallower
power-law ($\Gamma \sim 0-0.25$) between a few tenths and a few solar masses
(ignoring the effects of unresolved binaries). The shape and universality of
the IMF at the stellar-substellar boundary is still under investigation and
uncertainties remain large, but most observations are consistent with a IMF
that declines ($\Gamma < -0.5$) well below the hydrogen burning limit.
Observations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of
most galaxies are also consistent with a ""universal IMF"", suggesting no gross
variations in the IMF over much of cosmic time. There are indications of
""non-standard"" IMFs in specific local and extragalactic environments, which
clearly warrant further study. Nonetheless, there is no clear evidence that the
IMF varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditions
after the first few generations of stars.

with other independent approaches based on baryonic acoustic oscillations and
X-ray measurements. Forthcoming data from the experiments HESS-2 and CTA should

applications of negative refractive index materials. Metamaterials represent
the natural candidates to realize such property by tailoring the effective

metamaterials is limited by coarse grained inclusions which give discreteness
to the electromagnetic parameters as a function of their density. We study the
negative refractive index of a metamaterial as a function of the linear density
of the lattice period at microwave frequency. The negative refractive index is
obtained by a waveguide filled with a split ring resonator array in a frequency
band below the cut off frequency of the waveguide. The special value of $n=-1$
typical of perfect lensing is maintained by tuning the density on a bandwidth
of 1 GHz. A cut-off density above which the metamaterial operates is observed.
A second critical density above which the transmission saturates is found close
to the Pendry limit. Such results on the density of negative refractive index
metamaterials open new paths towards the fine tuning of constitutive parameters

transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions fails in
hadro-production of nearly back-to-back hadrons with high transverse momentum.
The essential problem is that gauge invariant transverse momentum dependent
parton distribution functions cannot be defined with process-independent Wilson
line operators, thus implying a breakdown of universality. This has led
naturally to proposals that a correct approach is to instead use a type of
""generalized"" transverse momentum dependent factorization in which the basic
factorized structure is assumed to remain valid, but with transverse momentum
dependent parton distribution functions that contain non-standard, process
dependent Wilson line structures. In other words, to recover a factorization
formula, it has become common to assume that it is sufficient to simply modify
the Wilson lines in the parton correlation functions for each separate hadron.
In this paper, we will illustrate by direct counter-example that this is not
possible in a non-Abelian gauge theory. Since a proof of generalized transverse
momentum dependent factorization should apply generally to any hard
hadro-production process, a single counter-example suffices to show that a
general proof does not exist. Therefore, to make the counter-argument clear and
explicit, we illustrate with a specific calculation for a double spin asymmetry
in a spectator model with a non-Abelian gauge field. The observed breakdown of
generalized transverse momentum dependent factorization challenges the notion
that the role of parton transverse momentum in such processes can be described
using separate correlation functions for each external hadron.

disorder studied previously by Oganesyan and Huse [Phys. Rev. B 75, 155111

function of the disorder strength $W$, we use an exact renormalization
procedure in configuration space that generalizes the Aoki real-space RG
procedure for Anderson localization one-particle models [H. Aoki, J. Phys. C13,
3369 (1980)]. We focus on the statistical properties of the renormalized
hopping $V_L$ between two configurations separated by a distance $L$ in
configuration space (distance being defined as the minimal number of elementary
moves to go from one configuration to the other). Our numerical results point
towards the existence of a many-body localization transition at a finite
disorder strength $W_c$. In the localized phase $W>W_c$, the typical
renormalized hopping $V_L^{typ} \equiv e^{\bar{\ln V_L}}$ decays exponentially
in $L$ as $ (\ln V_L^{typ}) \simeq - \frac{L}{\xi_{loc}}$ and the localization
length diverges as $\xi_{loc}(W) \sim (W-W_c)^{-\nu_{loc}}$ with a critical
exponent of order $\nu_{loc} \simeq 0.5$. In the delocalized phase $W<W_c$, the
renormalized hopping remains a finite random variable as $L \to \infty$, and
the typical asymptotic value $V_{\infty}^{typ} \equiv e^{\bar{\ln V_{\infty}}}$
presents an essential singularity $(\ln V_{\infty}^{typ}) \sim -
(W_c-W)^{-\kappa}$ with an exponent of order $\kappa \sim 1.4$. Finally, we
show that this analysis in configuration space is compatible with the
localization properties of the simplest two-point correlation function in real
space.

analyzing the Fe25 K_alpha lines originating from the jets, we detect rapid
variability of the Doppler shifts, dz/dt ~ 0.019/0.33 day^-1, which is larger
than those expected from the precession and/or nodding motion. This phenomenon
probably corresponding to ""jitter"" motions observed for the first time in
X-rays, for which significant variability both in the jet angle and intrinsic
speed is required. From the time lag of optical Doppler curves from those of
X-rays, we estimate the distance of the optical jets from the base to be ~(3-4)

innermost temperature of the jets to be T_0 = 13 +/- 2 keV and 16 +/- 3 keV
(the average of the blue and red jets) for the out-of-eclipse and in-eclipse
phase, respectively, from the line intensity ratio of Fe25 K_alpha and Fe26

eclipse is consistent with a multi-temperature bremsstrahlung emission expected
from the jets, and its reflection component from cold matter, the

part focussed on the optical spectroscopy and the improvement in the

energy distribution of Sharov 21 are shown to be very similar to that of
normal, radio-quiet type 1 quasars. We present photometric data covering more
than a century and resulting in a long-term light curve that is densely sampled
over the past five decades. The variability of the quasar is characterized by a
ground state with typical fluctuation amplitudes of ~0.2 mag around B~20.5,
superimposed by a singular flare of ~2 yr duration (observer frame) with the
maximum at 1992.81 where the UV flux has increased by a factor of ~20. The
total energy in the flare is at least three orders of magnitudes higher than
the radiated energy of the most luminous supernovae, provided that it comes
from an intrinsic process and the energy is radiated isotropically. The profile
of the flare light curve appears to be in agreement with the standard
predictions for a stellar tidal disruption event where a ~10 M_sun giant star
was shredded in the tidal field of a ~2...5 10^8 M_sun black hole. The short
fallback time derived from the light curve requires an ultra-close encounter
where the pericentre of the stellar orbit is deep within the tidal disruption
radius. Gravitational microlensing provides an alternative explanation, though
the probability of such a high amplification event is very low.

similarities with the one of a L\'evy process and the first {\em quantitative}
chaos propagation result for the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation for
hard spheres (improvement of the %non-contructive convergence result of
Sznitman \cite{S1}). Moreover our chaos propagation results are the first
uniform in time ones for Boltzmann collision processes (to our knowledge),
which partly answers the important question raised by Kac of relating the
long-time behavior of a particle system with the one of its mean-field limit,
and we provide as a surprising application a new proof of the well-known result
of gaussian limit of rescaled marginals of uniform measure on the
$N$-dimensional sphere as $N$ goes to infinity (more applications will be
provided in a forthcoming work). Our results are based on a new method which
reduces the question of chaos propagation to the one of proving a purely
functional estimate on some generator operators ({\em consistency estimate})
together with fine stability estimates on the flow of the limiting non-linear

explosion, and that the critical moment $s_+$ can be obtained by solving

refinements of this moment formula, we first derive a novel tail expansion for

the dust coma of 67P/C-G and predict the speed and flux of dust in the coma,
the dust fluence on a spacecraft along sample trajectories, and the radiation
environment in the coma. The model will need to be refined when more details of
the coma are revealed by observations. An overview of astronomical observations
of 67P/C-G is given and model parameters are derived from these data where
possible. For quantities not yet measured for 67P/C-G, we use values obtained

constraining the mass distribution is currently only possible by the analysis

cluster can be involved in an action. This mimics the situations in which an
attack is planned by a central body, and the largest attack force is used. We
study the model in its annealed random graph version, on a fixed network, and
on a network evolving through the actions. The sizes of actions are distributed
with a power-law tail, however, the exponent is non-universal and depends on
the frequency of actions and sparseness of the available connections between
units. Allowing the network reconstruction over time in a self-organized
manner, e.g., by adding the links based on previous liaisons between units, we
find that the power-law exponent depends on the evolution time of the network.
Its lower limit is given by the universal value 5/2, derived analytically for
the case of random fragmentation processes. In the temporal patterns behind the
size of actions we find long-range correlations in the time series of number of
clusters and non-trivial distribution of time that a unit waits between two
actions. In the case of an evolving network the distribution develops a
power-law tail, indicating that through the repeated actions, the system
develops internal structure which is not just more effective in terms of the
size of events, but also has a full hierarchy of units.

and likely significant component of their total stellar mass. Our sample of
groups and clusters includes AGN feedback and is of high enough resolution to
accurately resolve galaxy populations down to the smallest galaxies that are
expected to significantly contribute to the stellar mass budget. We describe
and test four different methods to identify the ICL in simulations, thereby
allowing us to assess the reliability of the measurements. For all of the
methods, we consistently find a very significant ICL stellar fraction (~45%)
which exceeds the values typically inferred from observations. However, we show
that this result is robust with respect to numerical resolution and integration
accuracy, remarkably insensitive to changes in the star formation model, and
almost independent of halo mass. It is also almost invariant when black hole
growth is included, even though AGN feedback successfully prevents excessive
overcooling in clusters and leads to a drastically improved agreement of the
simulated cluster galaxy population with observations. In particular, the
luminosities of central galaxies and the ages of their stellar populations are
much more realistic when including AGN. In the light of these findings, it
appears challenging to construct a simulation model that simultaneously matches
the cluster galaxy population and at the same time produces a low ICL
component. We find that intracluster stars are preferentially stripped in a
cluster's densest region from massive galaxies that fall into the cluster at
z>1. Surprisingly, some of the intracluster stars also form in the intracluster
medium inside cold gas clouds that are stripped out of infalling galaxies.

magnetic fields and line-of-sight velocities of the solar plasma depends a
great deal on the sensitivity to these physical quantities of the spectral
lines chosen to be measured. Recently, doubts have been raised about visible
Stokes profiles to provide a clear distinction between weak fields and strong
ones filling a small fraction of the observed area. The goal of this paper is
to give qualitative and quantitative arguments that help in settling the debate
since several instruments that employ visible lines are either operating or
planned for the near future. The sensitivity of the Stokes profiles is
calculated through the response functions (e.g. Ruiz Cobo & Del Toro Iniesta,
1994). Both theoretical and empirical evidences are gathered in favor of the
reliability of visible Stokes profiles. The response functions are used as well
for estimating the uncertainties in the physical quantities due to noise in the
observations. A useful formula has been derived that takes into account the
measurement technique (number of polarization measurements, polarimetric
efficiencies, number of wavelength samples), the model assumptions (number of
free parameters, the filling factor), and the radiative transfer (response
functions). We conclude that a scenario with a weak magnetic field can
reasonably be distinguished with visible lines from another with a strong field
but a similar Stokes $V$ amplitude, provided that the Milne-Eddington
approximation is good enough to describe the solar atmosphere and that the
polarization signal is at least three or four times larger than the typical rms
noise of $ 10^{-3} I_{\rm c}$ reached in the observations.

star systems to investigate whether accretion towards protoplanets can proceed
despite the strong gravitational perturbations from the secondary star. The
orbits of planetesimals are numerically integrated in two dimensions under the
influence of the two stars and gas drag. The masses and orbits of the
planetesimals are allowed to evolve due to collisions with other planetesimals
and accretion of collisional debris. In addition, the mass in debris can evolve
due to planetesimal-planetesimal collisions and the creation of new
planetesimals. We show that it is possible in principle for km-sized
planetesimals to grow by two orders of magnitude in size if the efficiency of
planetesimal formation is relatively low. We discuss the limitations of our
two-dimensional approach.

OB2 region, based on U band observations. Our study comprises 95 members of the
~4 Myr-old cluster Tr 37 (including 20 ""transition"" objects; TO), as well as
the only CTTS in the ~12 Myr-old cluster NGC 7160. The stars show different
disk morphologies, with the majority of them having evolved and flattened
disks. The typical accretion rates are about one order of magnitude lower than
in regions aged 1-2 Myr, and we find no strong correlation between disk
morphology and accretion rates. Although half of the TO are not accreting, the
median accretion rates of normal CTTS and accreting ""transition"" disks are
similar (~3 10^{-9} and 2 10^{-9} Msun/yr, respectively). Comparison with other
regions suggests that the TO observed at different ages do not necessarily
represent the same type of objects, which is consistent with the fact that the
different processes that can lead to reduced IR excess/inner disk clearing
(e.g., binarity, dust coagulation/settling, photoevaporation, giant planet
formation) do not operate on the same timescales. Accreting TO in Tr 37 are
probably suffering strong dust coagulation/settling. Regarding the equally
large number of non-accreting TO in the region, other processes, like
photoevaporation, the presence of stellar/substellar companions, and/or giant
planet formation may account for their ""transitional"" SEDs and negligible
accretion rates.

Ia (SN Ia) properties related to the age and masses of the progenitors that
could introduce a systematic bias between low and high redshift SN Ia's. The
relation between the main features of the distribution of the delay times (DTD)
and the masses of the progenitors is illustrated for the single (SD) and double
degenerate (DD) models. Mixed models, which assume contributions from both the
SD and DD channels, are also presented and tested versus the observed
correlations between the SN Ia rates and the parent galaxy properties. It is
shown that these correlations can be accounted for with both single channel and
mixed models, and that the rate in S0 and E galaxies may effectively provide
clues on the contribution of SD progenitors to late epoch explosions. A wide
range of masses for the CO WD at the start of accretion is expected in almost
all galaxy types; only in galaxies of the earliest types the properties of the
progenitors are expected to be more uniform. For mixed models, late type
galaxies should host SD and DD explosions in comparable fractions, while in
early type galaxies DD explosions should largely prevail. Events hosted by star
forming galaxies span a wide range of delay times; \textit{prompt} events could
dominate only in the presence of a strong star-burst. It is concluded that
nearby SN Ia samples should well include the young, massive and hot progenitors
that necessarily dominate at high redshift.

proper time of all inertial systems from the observer proper time, which is
taken as a time standard. So, any temporal inference relies in first instance
on the observer own time. The question is thus: what fixes the observer proper
time? This will be the crucial point debated here. This implies analyzing at
the very first why the observer can be taken as a motionless reference in spite
of being himself inertial. Is this just an approximation, and if so, up to what
extent can it be applied? The framework of special relativity is compared to an
amended form in which the fact of taking himself as a reference does not allow
the observer to overlook its own kinetics. So, the issue stands on which of two
formulations of the Lorentz gamma factor is the most accurate one: its standard
expression or an amended one which takes into account the fact that the
observer is himself inertial, while the former disregards it. When the observer
speed is ignored, the two formulations become identical. Hence, the standard
relativistic expression of gamma can be seen as an approximation applicable
when the observer motion is null or low, such as it is the instance on Earth.

section, angular distributions of both omega-mesons and protons were measured

Jackson frame. In addition, the orientation of the omega-spin and invariant
mass spectra were determined. We observe omega-production to take place
dominantly in Ss and Sp final states at epsilon = 92, 128 MeV and,
additionally, in Sd at epsilon= 173 MeV. No obvious indication of resonant
omega-production via N^*-resonances was found, as proton angular distributions
are almost isotropic and invariant mass spectra are compatible with phase space
distributions. A dominant role of ^3P_1 and ^1S_0 initial partial waves for
omega-production was concluded from the orientation of the decay plane of the
omega-meson. Although the Jackson angle distributions in the omega-p-Jackson
frame are anisotropic we argue that this is not an indication of a resonance
but rather a kinematical effect reflecting the anisotropy of the omega angular
distribution. The helicity angle distribution in the omega-p-helicity frame
shows an anisotropy which probably reflects effects of the omega angular
momenta in the final state; this observable may be, in addition to the
orientation of the omega decay plane, the most sensitive one to judge the

computing. In the classic version of this problem, n processes perform a
concurrent program which occasionally triggers some of them to use shared

design a distributed algorithm to control entries and exits to/from the shared
resource in such a way that in any time there is at most one process accessing
it. We consider both the classic and a slightly weaker version of mutual
exclusion, called ep-mutual-exclusion, where for each period of a process
staying in the critical section the probability that there is some other
process in the critical section is at most ep. We show that there are channel
settings, where the classic mutual exclusion is not feasible even for
randomized algorithms, while ep-mutual-exclusion is. In more relaxed channel
settings, we prove an exponential gap between the makespan complexity of the
classic mutual exclusion problem and its weaker ep-exclusion version. We also
show how to guarantee fairness of mutual exclusion algorithms, i.e., that each
process that wants to enter the critical section will eventually succeed.

across a network. At SODA 2008, a quasirandom version of this protocol was
proposed and competitive bounds for its run-time were proven. This prompts the
question: to what extent does the quasirandom protocol inherit the second
principal advantage of randomized rumor spreading, namely robustness against
transmission failures?
  In this paper, we present a result precise up to $(1 \pm o(1))$ factors. We
limit ourselves to the network in which every two vertices are connected by a
direct link. Run-times accurate to their leading constants are unknown for all
other non-trivial networks.
  We show that if each transmission reaches its destination with a probability
of $p \in (0,1]$, after $(1+\e)(\frac{1}{\log_2(1+p)}\log_2n+\frac{1}{p}\ln n)$
rounds the quasirandom protocol has informed all $n$ nodes in the network with
probability at least $1-n^{-p\e/40}$. Note that this is faster than the
intuitively natural $1/p$ factor increase over the run-time of approximately
$\log_2 n + \ln n $ for the non-corrupted case.
  We also provide a corresponding lower bound for the classical model. This
demonstrates that the quasirandom model is at least as robust as the fully
random model despite the greatly reduced degree of independent randomness.

lengths - here defined as the distance over which quantum mechanical
superposition is still valid - for, \textit{e.g}, electrons and photons in a

hydrodynamic regimes. These are: a) The quasi-adiabatic supergalactic winds. b)
The bimodal flows, with mass accumulation in the central zones and gas
expulsion from the outer zones of the assembling galaxy. c) The gravitationally
bound regime, for which all of the gas returned by massive stars remains bound
to the host galaxy and is likely to be reprocessed into futher generations of
stars. Which of the three possible solutions takes place, depends on the mass
of the star forming region its mechanical luminosity (or star formation rate)
and its size. The model predicts that massive assembling galaxies with large
star formation rates similar to those detected in SCUBA sources ($\sim 1000$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) are likely to evolve in a positive star-formation feedback
condition, either in the bimodal, or in the gravitationally bound regime. This
implies that star formation in these sources may have little impact on the
