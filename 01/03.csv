nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in oxide has been rather elusive, unlike the other
materials. Here, the recent experimental data from ion-implanted Si NCs is
unambiguously explained within the context of QCSE using an atomistic
pseudopotential theory. This further reveals that the majority of the Stark
shift comes from the valence states which undergo a level crossing that leads
to a nonmonotonic radiative recombination behavior with respect to the applied
field. The polarizability of embedded Si NCs including the excitonic effects is
extracted over a diameter range of 2.5--6.5 nm, which displays a cubic scaling,
$\alpha=c D^3$, with $c=2.436\times 10^{-11}$ C/(Vm), where $D$ is the NC
diameter. Finally, based on intraband electroabsorption analysis, it is
predicted that p-doped Si NCs will show substantial voltage tunability, whereas
n-doped samples should be almost insensitive. Given the fact that bulk silicon
lacks the linear electro-optic effect as being a centrosymmetric crystal, this
may offer a viable alternative for electrical modulation using p-doped Si NCs.

substantially from the inclusion of a pseudorandom component (a numerical
sequence that is precisely known by specification or calculation but otherwise
arbitrary). The essential requirement is that the sequence is uncorrelated with
the decision space topology, so that its effect is to pseudorandomly distribute

the randomness in an inherently stochastic algorithm, it is in fact
fundamentally different because CFO remains deterministic at every step. Three

flexible and accurate method for the simulation of waves in unbounded media.
Most PML formulations, however, usually require wave equations stated in their
standard second-order form to be reformulated as first-order systems, thereby
introducing many additional unknowns. To circumvent this cumbersome and
somewhat expensive step, we instead propose a simple PML formulation directly
for the wave equation in its second-order form. Inside the absorbing layer, our
formulation requires only two auxiliary variables in two space dimensions and
four auxiliary variables in three space dimensions; hence it is cheap to
implement. Since our formulation requires no higher derivatives, it is also
easily coupled with standard finite difference or finite element methods.
Strong stability is proved while numerical examples in two and three space
dimensions illustrate the accuracy and long time stability of our PML
formulation.

orbiting Solar-like stars. Such transit signals are on the order of 100 ppm.
The high photometric precision demanded by Kepler requires detailed knowledge
of how the Kepler pixels respond to starlight during a nominal observation.
This information is provided by the Kepler pixel response function (PRF),
defined as the composite of Kepler's optical point spread function, integrated
spacecraft pointing jitter during a nominal cadence and other systematic
effects. To provide sub-pixel resolution, the PRF is represented as a
piecewise-continuous polynomial on a sub-pixel mesh. This continuous
representation allows the prediction of a star's flux value on any pixel given
the star's pixel position. The advantages and difficulties of this polynomial
representation are discussed, including characterization of spatial variation
in the PRF and the smoothing of discontinuities between sub-pixel polynomial
patches. On-orbit super-resolution measurements of the PRF across the Kepler
field of view are described. Two uses of the PRF are presented: the selection
of pixels for each star that maximizes the photometric signal to noise ratio
for that star, and PRF-fitted centroids which provide robust and accurate
stellar positions on the CCD, primarily used for attitude and plate scale
tracking. Good knowledge of the PRF has been a critical component for the
successful collection of high-precision photometry by Kepler.

735 km baseline is reported using neutral-current interaction data recorded by
the MINOS detectors in the NuMI neutrino beam. Such a depletion is not expected
according to conventional interpretations of neutrino oscillation data
involving the three known neutrino flavors. A depletion would be a signature of
oscillations or decay to postulated non-interacting ""sterile"" neutrinos,
scenarios not ruled out by existing data. From an exposure of 3.18x10^{20}
protons on target in which neutrinos of energies between ~500 MeV and 120 GeV
are produced predominantly as nu_mu, the visible energy spectrum of candidate
neutral-current reactions in the MINOS far detector is reconstructed.
Comparison of this spectrum to that inferred from a similarly selected near
detector sample shows that of the portion of the nu_mu flux observed to
disappear in charged-current interaction data, the fraction that could be
converting to a sterile state is less than 52% at 90% confidence level (C.L.).
The hypothesis that active neutrinos mix with a single sterile neutrino via
oscillations is tested by fitting the data to various models. In the particular
four-neutrino models considered, the mixing angles theta_{24} and theta_{34}
are constrained to be less than 11 degrees and 56 degrees at 90% C.L.,
respectively. The possibility that active neutrinos may decay to sterile
neutrinos is also investigated. Pure neutrino decay without oscillations is
ruled out at 5.4 standard deviations. For the scenario in which active
neutrinos decay into sterile states concurrently with neutrino oscillations, a
lower limit is established for the neutrino decay lifetime tau_3/m_3 >
2.1x10^{-12} s/eV at 90% C.L..

constant of three targets: 1) the minimax risk, 2) an oracle error that would
be available if the column space of the matrix were known, and 3) a more
adaptive oracle error which would be available with the knowledge of the column
space corresponding to the part of the matrix that stands above the noise.
Lastly, the error bounds regarding low-rank matrices are extended to provide an
error bound when the matrix has full rank with decaying singular values. The
analysis in this paper is based on the restricted isometry property (RIP)

still lacking. We derive asymptotic error rates of prediction procedures based
on these models under different data generation assumptions. This allows a
theoretical comparison between the WM-based and the FE-based predictions in
terms of asymptotic efficiency. Applications of the theoretical results are
demonstrated with empirical studies on ChIP-seq data and protein binding
microarray data. We find that, irrespective of underlying data generation
mechanisms, the FE approach shows higher or comparable predictive power
relative to the WM approach when the number of observed binding sites used for
constructing a discriminant decision is not too small.

such scheme fails to capture the spatial-temporal burstiness of the primary

and are believed to be rotating neutron stars formed in supernova explosions.
They are unique testing grounds of dense matter theories and gravitational
physics and also provide links among nuclear physics, particle physics and
General Relativity. Neutron stars may exhibit some of the most extreme and
exotic characteristics that could not be found elsewhere in the Universe. Their
properties are largely determined by the equation of state (EOS) of
neutron-rich matter, which is the chief ingredient in calculating neutron star
structure and properties of related phenomena, such as gravitational wave
emission from deformed pulsars. Presently, the EOS of neutron-rich matter is
still very uncertain mainly due to the poorly known density dependence of the
nuclear symmetry energy especially at supra-saturation densities. Nevertheless,
significant progress has been made recently in constraining the density
dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy mostly at sub-saturation densities
using terrestrial nuclear reactions. While there are still some uncertainties
especially at supra-saturation densities, these constraints could provide
useful information on the limits of the global properties of pulsars and the
gravitational waves to be expected from them. Here we review our recent work on
constraining properties of pulsars and gravitational radiation with data from

by a simple random walk on a graph with bounded degrees in its first n steps.
It is shown that this quantity grows linearly in the expected size of R_n if
the graph is uniformly transient, and sublinearly in the expected size if the
graph is uniformly recurrent with subexponential volume growth. This in
particular answers a question asked by Benjamini, Kozma, Yadin and Yehudayoff

with the \textit{Suzaku} X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) in the 0.2-12 keV
band and Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) in 10-600 keV band. The iron K$\alpha$ line
is well detected in all seven observations and K$\beta$ line is also detected
in four observations. In this paper, we investigate the origin of the Fe K
lines using both the width of the line and the reverberation mapping method.
  With the co-added XIS and HXD spectra, we identify Fe K$\alpha$ and K$\beta$
line at 6.396$_{-0.007}^{+0.009}$ keV and 7.08$_{-0.05}^{+0.05}$ keV,
respectively. The width of line obtained from the co-added spectra is
38$_{-18}^{+16}$ eV ($\textrm{FWHM}=4200_{-2000}^{+1800}$ km/s) which
corresponds to a radius of 20$_{-10}^{+50}$ light days, for the virial
production of $1.220\times10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ in NCG 5548.
  To quantitatively investigate the origin of the narrow Fe line by the
reverberation mapping method, we compare the observed light curves of Fe
K$\alpha$ line with the predicted ones, which are obtained by convolving the
continuum light curve with the transfer functions in a thin shell and an
inclined disk. The best-fit result is given by the disk case with $i=30^\circ$
which is better than a fit to a constant flux of the Fe K line at the 92.7%
level (F-test). We find that the emitting radius obtained from the light curve
is 25-37 light days, which is consistent with the radius derived from the Fe K
line width. Combining the results of the line width and variation, the most
likely site for the origin of the narrow iron lines is 20-40 light days away
from the central engine, though other possibilities are not completely ruled
out. (abridged)

multiple access (FDMA), a well known orthogonal-multiple-access (O-MA) scheme
has been preferred to non-orthogonal-multiple-access (NO-MA) schemes since FDMA
can achieve the sum-capacity of the channel with only single-user decoding
complexity [\emph{Chapter 14, Elements of Information Theory by Cover and
Thomas}]. However, with finite alphabets, in this paper, we show that NO-MA is
better than O-MA for a two-user GMAC. We plot the constellation constrained
(CC) capacity regions of a two-user GMAC with FDMA and time division multiple
access (TDMA) and compare them with the CC capacity regions with trellis coded
multiple access (TCMA), a recently introduced NO-MA scheme. Unlike the Gaussian
alphabets case, it is shown that the CC capacity region with FDMA is strictly
contained inside the CC capacity region with TCMA. In particular, for a given
bandwidth, the gap between the CC capacity regions with TCMA and FDMA is shown
to increase with the increase in the average power constraint. Also, for a
given power constraint, the gap between the CC capacity regions with TCMA and
FDMA is shown to decrease with the increase in the bandwidth. Hence, for finite
alphabets, a NO-MA scheme such as TCMA is better than the well known O-MAC
schemes, FDMA and TDMA which makes NO-MA schemes worth pursuing in practice for
a two-user GMAC.

better fits the practical computational needs. A method for constructing stable
solutions in the new sense is proposed and justified. The basic point is: in
the traditional definition of the stable solution to an ill-posed problem
$Au=f$, where $A$ is a linear or nonlinear operator in a Hilbert space $H$, it
is assumed that the noisy data $\{f_\delta, \delta\}$ are given,
$||f-f_\delta||\leq \delta$, and a stable solution $u_\d:=R_\d f_\d$ is defined
by the relation $\lim_{\d\to 0}||R_\d f_\d-y||=0$, where $y$ solves the
equation $Au=f$, i.e., $Ay=f$. In this definition $y$ and $f$ are unknown. Any
$f\in B(f_\d,\d)$ can be the exact data, where $B(f_\d,\d):=\{f:
||f-f_\delta||\leq \delta\}$.The new notion of the stable solution excludes the
unknown $y$ and $f$ from the definition of the solution.

corresponding eigenfunctions are obtained. As a by-product of the
representation, it turns out that a kind of solution is also a solution of
another eigenvalue problem with $p/2$-Laplacian.

Wente fail in dimension larger than two when Sobolev spaces are replaced by the
ad-hoc Morrey spaces. However, in this paper we prove that $L^{\infty}$
estimates hold in arbitrary dimension when Morrey spaces are replaced by their
Littlewood Paley counterparts: Besov-Morrey spaces. As an application we prove
the existence of conservation laws to solution of elliptic systems of the form
$-\Delta u= \Omega \cdot \nabla u$ where $\Omega$ is antisymmetric and both
$\nabla u$ and $\Omega$ belong to these Besov-Morrey spaces for which the
system is critical.

introduce a notion of weak characteristics of a vector distribution and prove
that if a bracket-generating distribution of constant type does not have

equations with repulsive forces, in radial symmetry. We provide a novel
integration method to show that the non-trivial classical solutions $(\rho,V)$,
with compact support in $[0,R]$, where $R>0$ is a positive constant and in the
sense which $\rho(t,r)=0$ and $V(t,r)=0$ for $r\geq R$, under the initial
condition% $H_{0}=\int_{0}^{R}rV_{0}dr>0$ blow up on or before the finite time

  The main contribution of this article provides the blowup results of the
Euler $(\delta=0)$ or Euler-Poisson $(\delta=1)$ equations with repulsive
forces, and with pressure $(\gamma>1)$, as the previous blowup papers
(\cite{MUK} \cite{MP}, \cite{P} and \cite{CT}) cannot handle the systems with
the pressure term, for $C^{1}$ solutions.

appearance of being overly specialized or highly artificial. A case for the
possible existence of traversable wormholes would be more compelling if an
abundance of solutions could be found. It is shown in this note that for many
of the wormhole geometries in the literature, the exact solutions obtained
imply the existence of large sets of additional solutions.

bounded tree distance width are known to be solvable in polynomial time
[Bod90],[YBFT99]. We give restricted space algorithms for these problems
proving the following results: - Isomorphism for bounded tree distance width
graphs is in L and thus complete for the class. We also show that for this kind
of graphs a canon can be computed within logspace. - For bounded treewidth
graphs, when both input graphs are given together with a tree decomposition,
the problem of whether there is an isomorphism which respects the
decompositions (i.e. considering only isomorphisms mapping bags in one
decomposition blockwise onto bags in the other decomposition) is in L. - For
bounded treewidth graphs, when one of the input graphs is given with a tree
decomposition the isomorphism problem is in LogCFL. - As a corollary the
isomorphism problem for bounded treewidth graphs is in LogCFL. This improves
the known TC1 upper bound for the problem given by Grohe and Verbitsky
[GroVer06].

their masses are modified in the hot and dense medium formed in high energy
heavy ion collisions. If discovered experimentally, they would be an
unequivocal evidence of in-medium mass shift found by means of hadronic probes.
We discuss a method proposed to search for this novel type of correlation,
illustrating it by means of D_s-mesons with in-medium shifted masses. These
particles are expected to be more easily detected and identified in future
upgrades at RHIC.
