Riemann-solver based, high-resolution shock-capturing method, and the
three-flavor, energy-dependent neutrino transport scheme VERTEX. VERTEX
integrates the neutrino moment equations with a variable Eddington factor
closure computed from a model Boltzmann equation and uses the ray-by-ray plus
approximation in 2D, assuming the neutrino distribution to be axially symmetric
around the radial direction, and thus the neutrino flux to be radial. Our
spacetime treatment employs the ADM 3+1 formalism with the conformal flatness
condition for the spatial three-metric. This approach is exact in 1D and has
been shown to yield very accurate results also for rotational stellar collapse.
We introduce new formulations of the energy equation to improve total energy
conservation in relativistic and Newtonian hydro simulations with Eulerian
finite-volume codes. Moreover, a modified version of the VERTEX scheme is
developed that simultaneously conserves energy and lepton number with better
accuracy and higher numerical stability. To verify our code, we conduct a
series of tests, including a detailed comparison with published 1D results for
stellar core collapse. Long-time simulations of proto-neutron star cooling over
several seconds both demonstrate the robustness of the new CoCoNuT-VERTEX code
and show the approximate treatment of GR effects by means of an effective
gravitational potential as in PROMETHEUS-VERTEX to be remarkably accurate in

and show the marginalised results as functions of halo mass and virialisation
redshift. While the hybrid model for the external shear gives results very
similar to those obtained from the non-linear model, ellipsoidal collapse
changes the collapse parameters typically by (20...50)%, in a way increasing
with decreasing halo mass and decreasing virialisation redshift. We
qualitatively confirm the dependence on mass and virialisation redshift of a
fitting formula for delta_c, but find noticeable quantitative differences in
particular at low mass and high redshift. The derived mass function is in good
agreement with mass functions recently proposed in the literature.

high spatial and temporal resolution. To this end we have developed a new code
that combines a gravitational Adaptive Particle-Particle, Particle-Mesh (AP3M)

evaluated while structure evolves during the simulation so that all evolution
steps--rather than just a few outputs--are used in the lensing computations.
The new code also includes a ray-tracing procedure that avoids periodicity
effects in a universe that is modeled as a 3-D torus in the standard way.
Results from our new simulations are compared with previous ones based on
Particle-Mesh simulations. We also systematically investigate the impact of box
volume, resolution, and ray-tracing directions on the variance of the computed
power spectra. We find that a box size of $512 h^{-1}$ Mpc is sufficient to
provide a robust estimate of the weak lensing angular power spectrum in the
$\ell$-interval (2,000--7,000). For a reaslistic cosmological model the power
$[\ell(\ell+1)C_{\ell}/2\pi]^{1/2}$ takes on values of a few $\mu K$ in this

particles are secondary to events. The discussion also proposes,
contradictorily, that observers who wish to model the macroscopic world
classically should do so in terms of classical fields, whereas, if we are to
use fields, it would more appropriate to adopt the mathematics of random
fields. Finally, the formalism used for discussion of Bell inequalities
introduces two assumptions that are not necessary for a random field model,
locality of initial conditions and non-contextuality, even though these
assumptions are, in contrast, very natural for a classical particle model.
Whether we discuss physics in terms of particles or in terms of events and

based on data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II) Supernova Survey.
The adopted sample of supernovae (SNe) includes 516 SNe Ia at redshift z
\lesssim 0.3, of which 270 (52%) are spectroscopically identified as SNe Ia.
The remaining 246 SNe Ia were identified through their light curves; 113 of
these objects have spectroscopic redshifts from spectra of their host galaxy,
and 133 have photometric redshifts estimated from the SN light curves. Based on
consideration of 87 spectroscopically confirmed non-Ia SNe discovered by the
SDSS-II SN Survey, we estimate that 2.04+1.61-0.95 % of the photometric SNe Ia
may be misidentified. The sample of SNe Ia used in this measurement represents
an order of magnitude increase in the statistics for SN Ia rate measurements in
the redshift range covered by the SDSS-II Supernova Survey. If we assume a SN
Ia rate that is constant at low redshift (z < 0.15), then the SN observations
can be used to infer a value of the SN rate of rV = (2.69+0.34+0.21-0.30-0.01)

of ~ 0.12, based on 79 SNe Ia of which 72 are spectroscopically confirmed.
However, the large sample of SNe Ia included in this study allows us to place
constraints on the redshift dependence of the SN Ia rate based on the SDSS-II
Supernova Survey data alone. Fitting a power-law model of the SN rate
evolution, r_V(z) = A_p x ((1 + z)/(1 + z0))^{\nu}, over the redshift range 0.0

driven methods. Standard procedures are used by air traffic controllers (ATC)
to guide aircraft, ensure the safety of the airspace, and to maximize the

of the aircraft remains with the pilots, leading to a large variability in the
flight patterns observed. Two methods to identify typical operations and their
variability from recorded radar tracks are presented. This knowledge base is
then used to monitor the conformance of current operations against operations
previously identified as standard. A tool called AirTrajectoryMiner is
presented, aiming at monitoring the instantaneous health of the airspace, in
real time. The airspace is ""healthy"" when all aircraft are flying according to
the nominal procedures. A measure of complexity is introduced, measuring the
conformance of current flight to nominal flight patterns. When an aircraft does
not conform, the complexity increases as more attention from ATC is required to
ensure a safe separation between aircraft.

method called ""phase closure nulling"" has been proposed for the detection of
such faint and close companions based on interferometric observations when the
system visibility amplitude is close to zero due to the large diameter of the
primary star. We aim at demonstrating this method by analyzing observations
obtained on the spectroscopic binary HD 59717. Methods: Using the AMBER/VLTI
instrument in the K-band with ~1500 spectral resolution, we record the
spectrally dispersed closures phases of the SB1 binary HD 59717 with a
three-baseline combination adequate for applying phase closure methods. After a
careful data reduction, we fit the primary diameter, the binary flux ratio, and
the separation using the phase closure data. Results: We detect the 5-mag
fainter companion of HD 59717 at a distance of 4 stellar radii from the
primary. We determine the diameter of the primary, infer the secondary's
spectral type and determine the masses and sizes of the stars in the binary
system. This is one of the highest contrasts detected by interferometry between
a companion and its parent star. Based on observations collected at the

would imply that the gravitating companion is not the same as the eclipsing

perturbations in the velocities due to the short-period oscillations of the
supergiant.

confirmation of large scale gravitational waves would be most welcome. Previous

by Sebastian et al., we find a Fermi surface comprising multiple pockets, as
revealed by the additional distinct quantum oscillation frequencies and
harmonics reported in this work. We find the originally reported broad low
frequency Fourier peak at 535 T to be clearly resolved into three separate
peaks at 460 T, 532 T and 602 T. Our increased resolution and angle-resolved
measurements identify these frequencies to originate from two similarly sized
pockets with greatly contrasting degrees of interlayer corrugation. The
spectrally dominant frequency originates from a pocket (\alpha) that is almost
ideally two-dimensional in form. In contrast, the newly resolved weaker
adjacent spectral features originate from a deeply corrugated pocket (\gamma).
On comparison with band structure, the d-wave symmetry of the interlayer
dispersion locates the minimally corrugated \alpha pocket at the 'nodal' point
where holes are located in a translational symmetry-broken scenario, and the
significantly corrugated \gamma pocket at the 'antinodal' point in the
Brillouin zone, where electrons are located in a translational symmetry-broken
scenario. Translational symmetry breaking by an SDW is suggested from the
strong suppression of Zeeman splitting for the spectrally dominant pocket,
additional evidence for which is provided from the harmonics we resolve in the
present experiments. Given the similarity in \alpha and \gamma pocket sizes,
their opposite carrier type and the previous report of a diverging effective
mass, we discuss the possibility of a secondary Fermi surface instability at
low dopings of the excitonic insulator type, associated with the
metal-insulator QCP.

of processes which are happening within the central parsec around the black
hole (BH). One example of such a wind is the partially ionized gas responsible
for X-ray and UV absorption ('warm absorbers'). Here we show that such gas will
have a distinct signature when viewed in polarized X-rays. Observations of such
polarization can test models for the geometry of the flow, and the gas
responsible for launching and collimating it. We present calculations which
show that the polarization depends on the hydrodynamics of the flow, the
quantum mechanics of resonance line scattering and the transfer of polarized
X-ray light in the highly ionized moving gas. The results emphasize the three
dimensional nature of the wind for modeling spectra. We show that the
polarization in the 0.1-10 keV energy range is dominated by the effects of
resonance lines. We predict a $5-25%$ X-ray polarization signature of type-2
objects in this energy range. These results are general to flows which
originate from a cold torus-like structure, located $\sim 1$pc from the BH,
which wraps the BH and is ultimately responsible for the apparent dichotomy
between type 1 and type 2 AGNs. Such signals will be detectable by future

migration which persists for the disk lifetime. Although we analyze in detail

quest for the first detection of gamma-ray emission from clusters of galaxies.
To complement these observational efforts, we use high-resolution simulations
of a broad sample of galaxy clusters, and follow self-consistent cosmic ray
(CR) physics using an improved spectral description. We study CR proton spectra
as well as the different contributions of the pion decay and inverse Compton
emission to the total flux and present spectral index maps. We find a universal
spectrum of the CR component in clusters with surprisingly little scatter
across our cluster sample. The spatial CR distribution also shows approximate
universality; it depends however on the cluster mass. This enables us to derive
a semi-analytic model for both, the distribution of CRs as well as the
pion-decay gamma-ray emission that results from hadronic CR interactions with
ambient gas protons. In addition, we provide an analytic framework for the
inverse Compton emission that is produced by shock-accelerated CR electrons and
valid in the full gamma-ray energy range. Combining the complete sample of the
brightest X-ray clusters observed by ROSAT with our gamma-ray scaling
relations, we identify the brightest clusters for the gamma-ray space telescope
Fermi and current imaging air Cherenkov telescopes (MAGIC, HESS, VERITAS). We
reproduce the result in Pfrommer (2008), but provide somewhat more conservative
predictions for the fluxes in the energy regimes of Fermi and imaging air
Cherenkov telescopes when accounting for the bias of `artificial galaxies' in
cosmological simulations. We find that it will be challenging to detect cluster
gamma-ray emission with Fermi after the second year but this mission has the
potential of constraining interesting values of the shock acceleration
efficiency after several years of surveying.

An analysis of the calcium and hydrogen abundances, Galactic
positions and kinematics of 146 DZ stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
demonstrates that interaction with the interstellar medium cannot account for
their externally polluted atmospheres. The calcium-to-hydrogen ratios for the
37 DZA stars are dominated by super-solar values, as are the lower limits for
the remaining 109 DZ stars. All together their metal-contaminated convective
envelopes contain 10^{20+-2} g of calcium, commensurate with the masses of
calcium inferred for large asteroids. It is probable that these stars are
contaminated by circumstellar matter; the rocky remains of terrestrial
planetary systems. In this picture, two predictions emerge: 1) at least 3.5% of
all main sequence A- and F-type stars build terrestrial planets; and 2) the DZA
stars are externally polluted by both metals and hydrogen, and hence constrain
the frequency and mass of water-rich, extrasolar planetesimals.

convergence of individual halo properties, based on their number of particles
N, focusing in particular on the mass of halos near the resolution limit of a
simulation. While it has been established that the halo mass function is
sampled on average down to N~30 particles, we show that individual halo
properties exhibit significant scatter, and some systematic biases, as one
approaches the resolution limit. We carry out a series of cosmological
simulations using the Gadget2 and Enzo codes with N_p=64^3 to N_p=1024^3 total
particles, keeping the same large-scale structure in the simulation box. We
consider boxes from l_{box} = 8 Mpc/h to l_{box} = 512 Mpc/h to probe different
halo masses and formation redshifts. We cross-identify dark matter halos in
boxes at different resolutions and measure the scatter in their properties. The
uncertainty in the mass of single halos depends on the number of particles
(scaling approximately as N^{-1/3}), but the rarer the density peak, the more
robust its identification. The virial radius of halos is very stable and can be
measured without bias for halos with N>30. In contrast, the average density
within a sphere containing 25% of the total halo mass is severely
underestimated (by more than a factor 2) and the halo spin is moderately
overestimated for N<100. If sub-grid physics is implemented upon a cosmological
simulation, we recommend that rare halos (~3sigma peaks) be resolved with N>100
particles and common halos (~1sigma peaks) with N>400 particles to avoid
excessive numerical noise and possible systematic biases in the results.

coherence times measured in Si, yet the orbital spectrum of Si dots is
increased as a result of the valley degree of freedom. The valley degeneracy
may be lifted by the interface potential, which gives rise to a valley-orbit
coupling, but the latter depends on the detailed structure of the interface and
is generally unknown a priori. These facts motivate us to provide an extensive
study of spin qubits in Si double quantum dots, accounting fully for the valley
degree of freedom and assuming no prior knowledge of the valley-orbit coupling.
For single-spin qubits we analyze the spectrum of a multivalley double quantum
dot, discuss the initialization of one qubit, identify the conditions for the
lowest energy two-electron states to be a singlet and a triplet well separated
from other states, and determine analytical expressions for the exchange
splitting. For singlet-triplet qubits we analyze the single-dot spectrum and
initialization process, the double-dot spectrum, singlet-triplet mixing in an
inhomogeneous magnetic field and the peculiarities of spin blockade in
multivalley qubits. We review briefly the hyperfine interaction in Si and
discuss its role in spin blockade in natural Si, including intravalley and
intervalley effects. We study the evolution of the double-dot spectrum as a
function of magnetic field. We address briefly the situation in which the
valley-orbit coupling is different in each dot due to interface roughness. We
propose a new experiment for measuring the valley splitting in a single quantum
dot. We discuss the possibility of devising other types of qubits in Si QDs,

offer significant enhancements in spectral coverage and a factor 2-3 increase

mass galaxies with high specific and surface star formation rates, and have a
spiral fraction of only ~10%. A comparison of the rest frame absolute
magnitudes of the GRB and CCSN sample is less conclusive than found in previous
work, suggesting that while GRB hosts are typically both smaller and bluer than
those of CCSN their total blue light luminosities are only slightly lower. We
suggest this is likely due to rapid periods of intensified star formation
activity, as indicated by the high specific star formation rates, which both
create the GRB progenitors and briefly significantly enhance the host galaxy
blue luminosity. Finally, our analysis of local environments of GRBs and CCSN
shows that GRBs are highly concentrated on their host light, and further occur
in regions of higher absolute surface luminosity than CCSN.

topic in modern astrophysics. Perhaps the most fundamental question associated
with GRBs is the nature of the astrophysical agent (or agents) that ultimately
powers them: the central engine. In this review, I focus on the possible
central engines of long-duration GRBs, and the constraints that present
observations place on these models. Long GRBs are definitively associated with
the deaths of massive stars, but whether the central engine is an accreting
black hole or a rapidly-spinning, highly-magnetized neutron star (a
""proto-magnetar"") remains unsettled. This distinction has been brought into
particular focus by recent MHD simulations of the core-collapse of massive,
rotating ""collapsar progenitors,"" which suggest that powerful
magneto-centrifugal outflows from the proto-neutron star may stave off black
hole formation entirely. Although both black hole and magnetar GRB models
remain viable, I argue that the magnetar model is more mature in the sense that
it provides quantitative explanations for the durations, energies, Lorentz

promising strategy to break the present stalemate is to further develop the
magnetar model until inescapable (and falsifiable) predictions emerge. This
course of action signals a renewed challenge to translate time-dependent jet
properties (power, magnetization, and Lorentz factor) into observables

recorded with the STAR detector at 62.4 and 200GeV. Elliptic flow as a function
of transverse momentum is reported for different collision centralities for
charged hadrons and strangeness containing hadrons $K_{S}^{0}$, $\Lambda$,
$\Xi$, $\phi$ in the midrapidity region $|eta|<1.0$. Significant reduction in
systematic uncertainty of the measurement due to non-flow effects has been
achieved by correlating particles at midrapidity, $|\eta|<1.0$, with those at
forward rapidity, $2.5<|\eta|<4.0$. We also present azimuthal correlations in
p+p collisions at 200 GeV to help estimating non-flow effects. To study the
system-size dependence of elliptic flow, we present a detailed comparison with
previously published results from Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. We observe that
$v_{2}$($p_{T}$) of strange hadrons has similar scaling properties as were
first observed in Au+Au collisions, i.e.: (i) at low transverse momenta,
$p_T<2GeV/c$, $v_{2}$ scales with transverse kinetic energy, $m_{T}-m$, and
(ii) at intermediate $p_T$, $2<p_T<4GeV/c$, it scales with the number of
constituent quarks, $n_q$. We have found that ideal hydrodynamic calculations
fail to reproduce the centrality dependence of $v_{2}$($p_{T}$) for $K_{S}^{0}$
and $\Lambda$. Eccentricity scaled $v_2$ values, $v_{2}/\epsilon$, are larger
in more central collisions, suggesting stronger collective flow develops in
more central collisions. The comparison with Au+Au collisions which go further
in density shows $v_{2}/\epsilon$ depend on the system size, number of
participants $N_{part}$. This indicates that the ideal hydrodynamic limit is
not reached in Cu+Cu collisions, presumably because the assumption of
thermalization is not attained.

elsewhere in QM, where the two measurements involved are timelike rather than
spacelike separated; and in which the correlations are usually assumed to have
a local causal explanation, requiring no action-at-a-distance. It is
interesting to ask how this is possible, in the light of Bell's Theorem. We
investigate this question, and present two options. Either (i) the new cases
are nonlocal, too, in which case action-at-a-distance is more widespread in QM
than has previously been appreciated (and does not depend on entanglement, as
usually construed); or (ii) the means of avoiding action-at-a-distance in the
new cases extends in a natural way to EPRB, removing action-at-a-distance in
these cases, too. There is a third option, viz., that the new cases are
strongly disanalogous to EPRB. But this option requires an argument, so far
missing, that the physical world breaks the symmetries which otherwise support
the analogy. In the absence of such an argument, the orthodox combination of
views -- action-at-a-distance in EPRB, but local causality in its timelike
analogue -- is less well established than it is usually assumed to be.

the evolution of the superhumps. The outburst amplitude was 5.5 magnitudes and
the Psh during the plateau phase was measured at 0.08335(31) and 0.08343(21) d,

was significantly longer than during the subsequent stages. Superhumps of 0.3

owing to their sparse association (only four so far) with long duration
gamma-ray bursts. Although both phenomena originate from the core collapse of a
massive star, supernovae emit mostly at optical wavelengths, whereas GRBs emit
mostly in soft gamma-rays or hard X-rays. Though the GRB central engine
generates ultra-relativistic jets, which beam the early emission into a narrow
cone, no relativistic outflows have hitherto been found in type Ib/c supernovae
explosions, despite theoretical expectations and searches. Here we report radio
(interferometric) observations that reveal a mildly relativistic expansion in a
nearby type Ic supernova, SN 2007gr. Using two observational epochs 60 days
apart, we detect expansion of the source and establish a conservative lower
limit for the average apparent expansion velocity of 0.6c. Independently, a
second mildly relativistic supernova has been reported. Contrary to the radio
data, optical observations of SN 2007gr indicate a typical type Ic supernova
with ejecta velocities ~6000 km/s, much lower than in GRB-associated
supernovae. We conclude that in SN 2007gr a small fraction of the ejecta

significant role in promoting the superconducting transition temperature in

estimate the highest possible Tc(max) for a given layered superconductor with
an effective c-axis lattice constant c*. For the newly discovered iron-based
superconductors, our results suggest that their Tc cannot exceed 60K, 50K and
40K for the 1111, 21311 and 122 series, respectively. In the case of
copper-based oxide superconductors, it seems that the highest Tc can reach
about 161K without applying of the external pressure. In our theoretical
framework, we could interpret the experimental results of the completely
different superconducting transition temperatures obtained in two very similar
cuprate superconductors (La{2-x}Ba{x}CuO{4} of 40K and
Sr{2-x}Ba{x}CuO{3+\delta} of 98K). In addition, the physical reason why the
superconductivity does not occur in noble metals (like gold, silver and copper)

powerlaw plus a black-body component. We find that the well known X-ray warm
absorber in this source consists of two different outflow velocity systems.
Recognizing the presence of these kinematically distinct components allows each
system to be fitted independently, each with two absorption components with
different ionization levels. The high velocity system consists of a component
with temperature of 2.7X10^6K and another component with temperature of
5.8X10^5K. The low-velocity system required also two absorbing components, one
with temperature of 5.8X10^5K; the other with lower temperature (3.5X10^4K).
Once these components are considered, the data do not require any further
absorbers. In particular, a model consisting of a continuous radial range of
ionization structures is not required. The two absorbing components in each
velocity system are in pressure equilibrium with each other. This suggests that
each velocity system consists of a multi-phase medium. This is the first time
that different outflow velocity systems have been modelled independently in the
X-ray band for this source. The kinematic components and column densities found
from the X-rays are in agreement with the main kinematic components found in
the UV absorber. This supports the idea that the UV and X-ray absorbing gas is
part of the same phenomenon. NGC 5548 can now be seen to fit in a pattern
established for other warm absorbers: 2 or 3 discrete phases in pressure
equilibrium. There are no remaining cases of a well studied warm absorber in

has many applications, especially, it is used in Compressed Sensing (CS),

Smoothed $\ell^0$ (SL0), for this task. Contrary to many other sparse recovery
algorithms, SL0 is not based on minimizing the $\ell^1$ norm, but it tries to
directly minimize the $\ell^0$ norm of the solution. The basic idea of SL0 is
optimizing a sequence of certain (continuous) cost functions approximating the
$\ell^0$ norm of a vector. However, in previous papers, we did not provide a
complete convergence proof for SL0. In this paper, we study the convergence
properties of SL0, and show that under a certain sparsity constraint in terms
of Asymmetric Restricted Isometry Property (ARIP), and with a certain choice of
parameters, the convergence of SL0 to the sparsest solution is guaranteed.
Moreover, we study the complexity of SL0, and we show that whenever the
dimension of the dictionary grows, the complexity of SL0 increases with the
same order as Matching Pursuit (MP), which is one of the fastest existing
sparse recovery methods, while contrary to MP, its convergence to the sparsest
solution is guaranteed under certain conditions which are satisfied through the
choice of parameters.

associated reconstruction error decays as a function of the oversampling ratio
$\lambda$. It was recently shown that exponential accuracy of the form
$O(2^{-r\lambda})$ can be achieved by appropriate one-bit Sigma-Delta
modulation schemes. By general information-entropy arguments $r$ must be less
than 1. The current best known value for $r$ is approximately 0.088. The
schemes that were designed to achieve this accuracy employ the ""greedy""
quantization rule coupled with feedback filters that fall into a class we call
""minimally supported"". In this paper, we study the minimization problem that
corresponds to optimizing the error decay rate for this class of feedback
filters. We solve a relaxed version of this problem exactly and provide
explicit asymptotics of the solutions. From these relaxed solutions, we find
asymptotically optimal solutions of the original problem, which improve the
best known exponential error decay rate to $r \approx 0.102$. Our method draws
from the theory of orthogonal polynomials; in particular, it relates the
optimal filters to the zero sets of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind.

  View","10.1002/qua.22972",,"physics.gen-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the meaning of the wave function by analyzing the mass and
charge density distributions of a quantum system. According to protective
measurement, a charged quantum system has mass and charge density distributing
in space, proportional to the modulus square of its wave function. In a
realistic interpretation, the wave function of a quantum system can be taken as
a description of either a physical field or the ergodic motion of a particle.
If the wave function is a physical field, then the mass and charge density will
be distributed throughout space at a given time for a charged quantum system,
and thus there will exist gravitational and electrostatic self-interactions of
its wave function. This not only violates the superposition principle of
quantum mechanics but also contradicts experimental observations. Thus the wave
function cannot be a description of a physical field but a description of the
ergodic motion of a particle. For the later there is only a localized particle
with mass and charge at every instant, and thus there will not exist any
self-interaction for the wave function. It is further argued that the classical
ergodic models, which assume continuous motion of particles, cannot be
consistent with quantum mechanics. Based on the negative result, we suggest
that the wave function is a description of the quantum motion of particles,
which is random and discontinuous in nature. On this interpretation, the
modulus square of the wave function not only gives the density of probability
of the particle being found in certain locations, but also gives the density of
objective probability of the particle being there. We show that this new
interpretation of the wave function provides a natural realistic alternative to
the orthodox interpretation, and its implications for other realistic
interpretations of quantum mechanics are also briefly discussed.

(CMB) experiments will have the power to improve on current constraints on
neutrino masses and provide new limits on neutrino degeneracy parameters. The
latter could surpass those derived from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the
observationally-inferred primordial helium abundance. These conclusions derive
from our Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulations which incorporate a full
BBN nuclear reaction network. This provides a self-consistent treatment of the
helium abundance, the baryon number, the three individual neutrino degeneracy
parameters and other cosmological parameters. Our analysis focuses on the
effects of gravitational lensing on CMB constraints on neutrino rest mass and
degeneracy parameter. We find for the PLANCK experiment that total (summed)
neutrino mass $M_{\nu} > 0.29$ eV could be ruled out at $2\sigma$ or better.
Likewise neutrino degeneracy parameters $\xi_{\nu_{e}} > 0.11$ and $|
\xi_{\nu_{\mu/\tau}} | > 0.49$ could be detected or ruled out at $2\sigma$
confidence, or better. For POLARBEAR we find that the corresponding detectable
values are $M_\nu > 0.75 {\rm eV}$, $\xi_{\nu_{e}} > 0.62$, and $|
\xi_{\nu_{\mu/\tau}}| > 1.1$, while for EPIC we obtain $M_\nu > 0.20 {\rm eV}$,
$\xi_{\nu_{e}} > 0.045$, and $|\xi_{\nu_{\mu/\tau}}| > 0.29$. Our forcast for
EPIC demonstrates that CMB observations have the potential to set constraints
on neutrino degeneracy parameters which are better than BBN-derived limits and
an order of magnitude better than current WMAP-derived limits.

changes as this set of curves is changed it is necessary to describe the
relationships between these sets of curves in a way that reflects the effect of
the curves on the classification. The usual algebra of sets fails to do this.
We remedy this situation by generalising inclusion, intersection, and union:
producing an algebra of sets on the set of all b.p.p. satisfying sets of curves

hole, we obtain the transition frequency of the black hole, analogous to the
case of a hydrogen atom, in the semiclassical limit. According to Bohr's
correspondence principle, this transition frequency at large quantum number is
equal to classical oscillation frequency. For the corresponding classical
system of periodic motion with this oscillation frequency, an action variable
is identified and quantized via Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization, from which the
quantized spectrum of the horizon area is obtained. This method can be applied

(8.5x10^{-3} Lsun$) through the turbulence decay in B1 main core, which
suggests that the outflows can not sustain the turbulence in this region. Since
the outflows are energetic enough to compensate the dissipating turbulence
energy in the neighboring, more evolved star forming region NGC 1333, we
suggest that the turbulence energy balance depends on the evolutionary state of
the star formation in molecular clouds.

transferring the excitation to the reaction center which stores energy from the
photon in chemical bonds. This process occurs with near-perfect quantum
efficiency. Recent experiments at cryogenic temperatures have revealed that
coherent energy transfer - a wavelike transfer mechanism - occurs in many
photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes (1-4). Using the Fenna-Matthews-Olson
antenna complex (FMO) as a model system, theoretical studies incorporating both
incoherent and coherent transfer as well as thermal dephasing predict that
environmentally assisted quantum transfer efficiency peaks near physiological
temperature; these studies further show that this process is equivalent to a
quantum random walk algorithm (5-8). This theory requires long-lived quantum
coherence at room temperature, which never has been observed in FMO. Here we
present the first evidence that quantum coherence survives in FMO at
physiological temperature for at least 300 fs, long enough to perform a
rudimentary quantum computational operation. This data proves that the
wave-like energy transfer process discovered at 77 K is directly relevant to
biological function. Microscopically, we attribute this long coherence lifetime
to correlated motions within the protein matrix encapsulating the chromophores,
and we find that the degree of protection afforded by the protein appears
constant between 77 K and 277 K. The protein shapes the energy landscape and
mediates an efficient energy transfer despite thermal fluctuations. The
persistence of quantum coherence in a dynamic, disordered system under these
conditions suggests a new biomimetic strategy for designing dedicated quantum
computational devices that can operate at high temperature.

leads to a consistency relation between the sizes of orthogonal and equilateral

particular, for the single-field Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) inflation, the

mixed scenario where the quantum fluctuations of some other light scalar fields
contribute to a part of total curvature perturbation on the super-horizon scale

mixed scenario is $\tau_{NL}^{loc.}>({6\over 5}f_{NL}^{loc.})^2$. Comparing
these consistency relations to WMAP 7yr data, there is still a big room for the

sufficiently sparse error vectors. In this manuscript, we examine how the BasP

(schematic) spin-parity distributions, it was found that the surrogate ratio
method can be employed to determine neutron fission and capture cross sections
if 1) weak Weisskopf-Ewing condition (defined in this paper) is satisfied, 2)
there exist two surrogate reactions whose spin-parity distributions of the
decaying nuclei are almost equivalent, and 3) difference of the representative
spin values between the neutron-induced and surrogate reactions is no much
larger than 10 $\hbar$. If these conditions are satisfied, we need not to know
the spin-parity distributions populated by the surrogate method. Instead, we
should just select a pair of surrogate reactions which will populate the
similar spin-parity distributions, using targets having similar structure and
reactions having the similar reaction mechanisms. Achievable accuracy is
estimated to be around 5 and 10 % for fission and capture channels,
respectively, for nuclei of the Uranium region. The surrogate absolute method,
on the contrary, can be marginally applicable to determination of fission cross
sections. However, there will be little hope to apply this method for capture
cross section measurements unless the spin-parity distributions in the
neutron-induced and surrogate reactions are fairly close to each other or the
difference can be corrected theoretically. The surrogate ratio method was shown
also to be a robust method in the presence of breakup reactions, again, without
assuming specific breakup reaction mechanisms.

tidally locked to their star, that is, planets whose orbital period is equal to
the rotation period about their spin axis, so that one side always faces the
star and the other side is always dark. As extreme cases illustrating the
effects of slow and rapid rotation, we consider planets with rotation periods
equal to one current Earth year and one current Earth day. The dynamics
responsible for the surface climate (e.g., winds, temperature, precipitation)
and the general circulation of the atmosphere are discussed in light of
existing theories of atmospheric circulations. For example, as expected from
the increasing importance of Coriolis accelerations relative to inertial
accelerations as the rotation rate increases, the winds are approximately
isotropic and divergent at leading order in the slowly rotating atmosphere but
are predominantly zonal and rotational in the rapidly rotating atmosphere.
Free-atmospheric horizontal temperature variations in the slowly rotating
atmosphere are generally weaker than in the rapidly rotating atmosphere.
Interestingly, the surface temperature on the night side of the planets does
not fall below ~240 K in either the rapidly or slowly rotating atmosphere; that
is, heat transport from the day side to the night side of the planets
efficiently reduces temperature contrasts in either case. Rotational waves
shape the distribution of winds, temperature, and precipitation in the rapidly
rotating atmosphere; in the slowly rotating atmosphere, these distributions are
controlled by simpler divergent circulations. The results are of interest in
the study of tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets and as illustrations of how
planetary rotation and the insolation distribution shape climate.

important to understand genetic causes of complex disease traits. At present,
identifying gene-gene interactions from genome-wide case-control studies is
computationally and methodologically challenging. In this paper, we introduce a
simple but powerful method, named `BOolean Operation based Screening and
Testing'(BOOST). To discover unknown gene-gene interactions that underlie
complex diseases, BOOST allows examining all pairwise interactions in
genome-wide case-control studies in a remarkably fast manner. We have carried
out interaction analyses on seven data sets from the Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium (WTCCC). Each analysis took less than 60 hours on a standard
3.0 GHz desktop with 4G memory running Windows XP system. The interaction
patterns identified from the type 1 diabetes data set display significant
difference from those identified from the rheumatoid arthritis data set, while
both data sets share a very similar hit region in the WTCCC report. BOOST has
also identified many undiscovered interactions between genes in the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) region in the type 1 diabetes data set. In the
coming era of large-scale interaction mapping in genome-wide case-control
studies, our method can serve as a computationally and statistically useful
tool.

For brown dwarfs this connection was not investigated as yet because there are
very few samples available. We aim to extend this investigation well down into
the substellar regime for our large sample of BDs in the Orion Nebula Cluster,
for which we have recently measured rotational periods. In order to investigate
a rotation-disk correlation, we derived near-infrared (NIR) excesses for a
sample of 732 periodic variables in the Orion Nebula Cluster with masses

Circumstellar NIR excesses were derived from the Delta[I-K] index. We performed
our analysis in three mass bins.We found a rotation-disk correlation in the
high and intermediate mass regime, in which objects with NIR excess tend to
rotate slower than objects without NIR excess. Interestingly, we found no
correlation in the substellar regime. A tight correlation between the
peak-to-peak (ptp) amplitude of the rotational modulation and the NIR excess
was found however for all objects with available ptp values. We discuss
possible scenarios which may explain the lack of rotation-disk connection in
the substellar mass regime. One possible reason could be the strong dependence
of the mass accretion rate on stellar mass in the investigated mass range.

predominance of faculae at all disk positions except close to disk center (mu >

are consistent with other observations of BPs and faculae at various disk

for its radio, optical, X-ray and gamma-ray energy emissions. In this Letter we
study the gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV from IC 443 as obtained by the AGILE
satellite. A distinct pattern of diffuse emission in the energy range 100 MeV-3
GeV is detected across the SNR with its prominent maximum (source ""A"")
localized in the Northeastern shell with a flux F = (47 \pm 10) 10^{-8} photons
cm^{-2} s^{-1} above 100 MeV. This location is the site of the strongest shock
interaction between the SNR blast wave and the dense circumstellar medium.
Source ""A"" is not coincident with the TeV source located 0.4 degree away and
associated with a dense molecular cloud complex in the SNR central region. From
our observations, and from the lack of detectable diffuse TeV emission from its
Northeastern rim, we demonstrate that electrons cannot be the main emitters of
gamma-rays in the range 0.1-10 GeV at the site of the strongest SNR shock. The
intensity, spectral characteristics, and location of the most prominent
gamma-ray emission together with the absence of co-spatial detectable TeV
emission are consistent only with a hadronic model of cosmic-ray acceleration
in the SNR. A high-density molecular cloud (cloud ""E"") provides a remarkable
""target"" for nucleonic interactions of accelerated hadrons: our results show
enhanced gamma-ray production near the molecular cloud/shocked shell
interaction site. IC 443 provides the first unambiguous evidence of cosmic-ray
acceleration by SNRs.

phenomenologically relevant features arise in these models. First, an extra
suppression on the lepton Yukawa couplings makes the tau lepton more composite
than naively expected from its mass. As a consequence new light leptonic
resonances, with masses as low as few hundreds of GeV, large couplings to tau
and a very characteristic collider phenomenology, are quite likely. Second, the
discrete symmetry A4 together with the model structure provide a double-layer
of flavor protection that allows to keep tree-level mediated processes below
present experimental limits. One-loop processes violating lepton flavor, like
mu -> e gamma, may be however observable at future experiments.

telescope. The multi-epoch flux data in any two different bands obtained on the
same night show a very tight linear flux to flux relationship for all target
AGNs. The flux of the host galaxy within the photometric aperture is carefully
estimated by surface brightness fitting to available high-resolution HST images
and MAGNUM images. The flux of narrow emission lines in the photometric bands
is also estimated from available spectroscopic data. We find that the
non-variable component of the host galaxy plus narrow emission lines for all
target AGNs is located on the fainter extension of the linear regression line
of multi-epoch flux data in the flux to flux diagram. This result strongly
indicates that the spectral shape of AGN continuum emission in the optical
region does not systematically change during flux variation. The trend of
spectral hardening that optical continuum emission becomes bluer as it becomes
brighter, which has been reported by many studies, is therefore interpreted as
the domination of the variable component of the nearly constant spectral shape
of an AGN as it brightens over the non-variable component of the host galaxy
plus narrow lines, which is usually redder than AGN continuum emission.

activities of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on the grounds of imaging
observations of individual galaxies. To quantitatively examine this hypothesis,
we calculate quasar luminosity functions (LFs) by manipulating the observed
galaxy LFs ($z\lesssim 2$) and theoretical merger rates from semi-analytical
formulations. We find that the model reproduces the observed quasar LFs
provided that the mass ratio ($q$) of the secondary galaxy to the newly formed
one changes with cosmic time. The results show that the fraction of major
mergers decreases from $f_{\rm maj}\sim 0.2$ at $z\sim 2$ to $f_{\rm maj}\to 0$
at $z\sim 0$. As a consequence, the newly formed SMBHs from major mergers at
$z\sim 2$ may acquire a maximal spin due to the orbital angular momentum of the
merging holes. Subsequently, random accretion led by minor mergers rapidly
drives the SMBHs to spin down. Such an evolutionary trend of the SMBH spins is
consistent with that radiative efficiency of accreting SMBHs strongly declines
with cosmic time, reported by Wang et al. (2009). This suggests that minor
mergers are important in triggering activities of SMBHs at low redshift while
major mergers may dominate at high redshift.

and store and forward (SAF) have been recently proposed. In this paper, we
model different types of random network communications as the transmission of
flats of matroids. This novel framework encompasses RLNC and SAF and allows us
to introduce a novel protocol, referred to as random affine network coding
(RANC), based on affine combinations of packets. Although the models previously
proposed for RLNC and SAF only consider error control, using our framework, we
first evaluate and compare the performance of different network protocols in
the error-free case. We define and determine the rate, average delay, and
throughput of such protocols, and we also investigate the possibilities of
partial decoding before the entire message is received. We thus show that RANC
outperforms RLNC in terms of data rate and throughput thanks to a more
efficient encoding of messages into packets. Second, we model the possible
alterations of a message by the network as an operator channel, which
generalizes the channels proposed for RLNC and SAF. Error control is thus
reduced to a coding-theoretic problem on flats of a matroid, where two distinct
metrics can be used for error correction. We study the maximum cardinality of
codes on flats in general, and codes for error correction in RANC in
particular. We finally design a class of nearly optimal codes for RANC based on
rank metric codes for which we propose a low-complexity decoding algorithm. The
gain of RANC over RLNC is thus preserved with no additional cost in terms of
complexity.

encoded in the nonlinear regime. Precision cosmology thus requires precision
modeling of nonlinearities in general dark energy and modified gravity models.
We modify the Gadget-2 code and run a series of N-body simulations on modified
gravity cosmology to study the nonlinearities. The modified gravity model that
we investigate in the present paper is characterized by a single parameter
\zeta, which determines the enhancement of particle acceleration with respect
to general relativity (GR), given the identical mass distribution (\zeta = 1 in
GR). The first nonlinear statistics we investigate is the nonlinear matter
power spectrum at k < 3h/Mpc, which is the relevant range for robust weak
lensing power spectrum modeling at l < 2000. In this study, we focus on the
relative difference in the nonlinear power spectra at corresponding redshifts
where different gravity models have the same linear power spectra. This
particular statistics highlights the imprint of modified gravity in the
nonlinear regime and the importance to include the nonlinear regime in testing
GR. By design, it is less susceptible to the sample variance and numerical
artifacts. We adopt a mass assignment method based on wavelet to improve the
power spectrum measurement. We run a series of tests to determine the suitable
simulation specifications (particle number, box size and initial redshift). We
find that, the nonlinear power spectra can differ by ~30% for 10% deviation
from GR (|\zeta-1| = 0.1) where the rms density fluctuations reach 10. This
large difference, on one hand, shows the richness of information on gravity in
the corresponding scales, and on the other hand, invalidates simple
extrapolations of some existing fitting formulae to modified gravity cosmology.

the membrane shape through its spontaneous curvature and bending rigidity. The
lateral motion of the protein may be viewed as diffusion in an effective
potential, hence, the effective mobility is always reduced compared to the case
of free diffusion. Using a rigorous path-integral approach we derive an
analytical expression for the effective diffusion coefficient for small ratios
of temperature and bending rigidity, which is the biologically relevant limit.
Simulations show very good quantitative agreement with our analytical result.
The analysis of the correlation functions contributing to the diffusion
coefficient shows that the correlations between the stochastic force of the
protein and the response in the membrane shape are responsible for the
reduction.
  Our quantitative analysis of the membrane height correlation spectrum shows
an influence of the protein-membrane interaction causing a distinctly altered
wave-vector dependence compared to a free membrane. Furthermore, the time
correlations exhibit the two relevant timescales of the system: that of
membrane fluctuations and that of lateral protein diffusion with the latter
typically much longer than the former. We argue that the analysis of the
long-time decay of membrane height correlations can thus provide a new means to
determine the effective diffusion coefficient of proteins in the membrane.

  Frequency Dependence of Hysteresis Loops","3 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.82.174125",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigated nonequilibrium domain wall dynamics under an ac field by
measuring the hysteresis loops of epitaxial ferroelectric capacitors at various
frequencies and temperatures. Polarization switching is induced mostly by
thermally activated creep motion at lower frequencies, and by viscous flow
motion at higher frequencies. The dynamic crossover between the creep and flow
regimes unveils two frequency-dependent scaling regions of hysteresis loops.
Based on these findings, we constructed a dynamic phase diagram for hysteretic
ferroelectric domain dynamics in the presence of ac fields.

(graphs embedded in space) and where the search for connecting paths relies
only on local information, such as a node's location and that of its neighbors.
Constraints of this type are common in everyday life applications. Greedy
connectivity accounts also for imperfect transmission across established links
and is larger the higher the proportion of nodes that can be reached from other
nodes with a high probability. Greedy connectivity can be used as a criterion
for optimal network design.

  surfaces","23 pages, 17 figures and 5 programs written with Mathematica",,,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is known that for any non-zero $M in (-1/4,infty)$, if we roll the conic
{(x,y): 4 x^2-y^2/M}=1} on a line in a plane, and then we rotate about this
line the trace of a focus, then we obtain a surface of revolution D(M) with
mean curvature 1. If M<=0, D(M) is embedded and it is called unduloid, if M>0,
D(M) is not embedded and it is called nodoid. These surfaces are called
Delaunays and they are foliated by circles. The trace of the focus in the
construction above is called the profile curve of the Delaunay and it is
transversal to the circles. Another well known family of constant mean
curvature surfaces are the Twizzlers, they are foliated by helices and we can
naturally define a profile curve which is transversal to the helices. To make
the presentation in this abstract easier, we will be only considering Twizzlers
with mean curvature 1. In this paper we will prove that if we roll the profile
curve of a Twizzler on a line in a plane and, simultaneously, we move the
points in the line at the same speed, so that the rolling motion of the profile
curve looks like if it were placed on a treadmill, then, the trace made by the
origin of the profile curve is one of the closed heart-shaped curves
HS(M,w)={(x,y) : x^2+y^2+y/(1+w^2 x^2)=M} for some M>-1/4 and w>0. Using this
dynamical interpretation we will prove several properties for Twizzlers

a nanoscale region which would be negatively charged for diffusive transport at
local thermal equilibrium. In a three-terminal device we observe avalanche
amplification of electrical current, resulting in a situation comparable to the
Venturi effect in hydrodynamics. Numerical calculations using a random phase
approximation are in agreement with our data and suggest Coulomb interaction as
the dominant scattering mechanism.

model, in particular the impact on the pricing of contingent claims, thanks to
Dirichlet Forms methods. We apply recent techniques, developed by Bouleau, to
hedging procedures in order to compute the sensitivities of SDE trajectories
with respect to parameter perturbations. We show that this model can reproduce
a bid-ask spread. We also prove that, if the stochastic differential equation
admits a closed form representation, also the sensitivities have closed form
representations.
  We exhibit the case of log-normal diffusion and we show that this framework
foresees a smiled implied volatility surface coherent with historical data.
