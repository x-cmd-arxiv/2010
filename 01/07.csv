  Analysis of Golf Swings","23 pages, 9 figures",,,,"physics.ins-det physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The motion of the golf club is measured using two accelerometers mounted at
different points along the shaft of the golf club, both sensitive to
acceleration along the axis of the shaft. The resulting signals are resolved
into differential and common mode components. The differential mode, a measure
of the centripetal acceleration of the golf club, is a reasonable proxy for
club speed and can be used to understand details of tempo, rhythm, and timing.
The common mode, related to the acceleration of the hands, allows insight into
the torques that generate speed in the golf swing. This measurement scheme is
used in a comparative study of twenty-five golfers in which it is shown that
club head speed is generated in the downswing as a two step process. The first
phase involves impulsive acceleration of the hands and club. This is followed
by a second phase where the club is accelerated while the hands decelerate.
This study serves to emphasize that the measurement scheme yields a robust data
set which provides deep insight into the tempo, rhythm, timing and the torques
that generate power in the golf swing.

effective temperature (T_eff) below 700K emit more than half their flux at
wavelengths beyond 3um, and the ratio of the mid-infrared flux to the
near-infrared flux becomes very sensitive to T_eff. The color H-[4.5] is a good
indicator of T_eff with a relatively weak dependence on metallicity and
gravity. Conversely, the colors H-K and [4.5]-[5.8] are sensitive to
metallicity and gravity. Thus near- and mid-infrared photometry provide useful
indicators of the fundamental properties of brown dwarfs, and if temperature
and gravity are known, then mass and age can be determined from evolutionary
models. There are twelve dwarfs known with H-[4.5]>3.0, and 500< T_eff K < 800,
which we examine in detail. The ages of these dwarfs range from very young
(0.1-1.0 Gyr) to relatively old (3-12 Gyr). The mass range is possibly as low

sound in experiments based on density probes. Our work generalizes the
well-known studies of the dynamic structure factor $S(\bq,\omega)$ in
superfluid $^4$He in the critical region. We show that, in the unitary limit of
uniform superfluid Fermi gases, the relative weight of second vs. first sound
in the compressibility sum rule is given by the Landau--Placzek ratio
$\lp\equiv (\bar{c}_p-\bar{c}_v)/\bar{c}_v$ for all temperatures below $T_c$.
In contrast to superfluid $^4$He, $\lp$ is much larger in strongly interacting
Fermi gases, being already of order unity for $T \sim 0.8 T_c$, thereby
providing promising opportunities to excite second sound with density probes.
The relative weights of first and second sound are quite different in
$S(\bq,\omega)$ (measured in pulse propagation studies) as compared to
$\mathrm{Im}\chi_{nn}(\bq,\omega)$ (measured in two-photon Bragg scattering).
We show that first and second sound in $S(\bq,\omega)$ in a strongly
interacting Bose-condensed gas are similar to those in a Fermi gas at
unitarity. However, in a weakly interacting Bose gas, first and second sound
are mainly uncoupled oscillations of the thermal cloud and condensate,
respectively, and second sound has most of the spectral weight in
$S(\bq,\omega)$. We also discuss the behaviour of the superfluid and normal
fluid velocity fields involved in first and second sound.

Efimov states with zero-range interactions, due to a subleading oscillating
tail in the momentum distribution. We also obtain new expressions for the

strong photospheric expansion that for a few seconds the photosphere is located
at a radius r_ph >~ 1000 km. Such `superexpansions' imply a large and rapid
energy release, a feature characteristic of pure He burst models. Previous
calculations have shown that during a pure He burst, the freshly synthesized
heavy-element ashes of burning can be ejected in a strong radiative wind and
produce significant spectral absorption features. We search the burst data
catalogs and literature and find 32 superexpansion bursts. We find that these
bursts exhibit the following interesting features: (1) At least 31 are from
(candidate) ultracompact X-ray binaries in which the neutron star accretes
hydrogen-deficient fuel, suggesting that these bursts indeed ignite in a
helium-rich layer. (2) In 2 bursts we detect strong absorption edges during the
expansion phase. The edge energies and depths are consistent with the H-like or
He-like edge of iron-peak elements with abundances greater than 100 times
solar, suggesting that we are seeing the exposed ashes of nuclear burning. (3)
The superexpansion phase is always followed by a moderate expansion phase
during which r_ph ~ 30 km and the luminosity is near the Eddington limit. (4)
The decay time of the bursts, t_d, ranges from short (approximately 10 s) to
intermediate (>~ 1000 s). However, despite the large range of t_d, the duration
of the superexpansion is always a few seconds, independent of t_d. By contrast,
the duration of the moderate expansion is always of order t_d. (5) The
photospheric radii r_ph during the moderate expansion phase are much smaller
than steady state wind models predict. We show that this may be further
indication that the wind contains highly non-solar abundances of heavy
elements.

approximate flavor symmetry of the neutrino sector, which has to appear in any
viable theory for neutrino mass-generation. The mu-tau breaking is not only
small, but also the source of Dirac CP-violation. We conjecture that both
discrete mu-tau and CP symmetries are fundamental symmetries of the seesaw
Lagrangian (respected by interaction terms), and they are only softly broken,
arising from a common origin via a unique dimension-3 Majorana mass-term of the
heavy right-handed neutrinos. From this conceptually attractive and simple
construction, we can predict the soft mu-tau breaking at low energies, leading
to quantitative correlations between the apparently two small deviations
\theta_{23} - 45^o and \theta_{13} - 0^o. This nontrivially connects the
on-going measurements of mixing angle \theta_{23} with the upcoming
experimental probes of \theta_{13}. We find that any deviation of \theta_{23} -
45^o must put a lower limit on \theta_{13}. Furthermore, we deduce the low
energy Dirac and Majorana CP violations from a common soft-breaking phase
associated with mu-tau breaking in the neutrino seesaw. Finally, from the soft
CP breaking in neutrino seesaw we derive the cosmological CP violation for the
baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. We fully reconstruct the leptogenesis
CP-asymmetry from the low energy Dirac CP phase and establish a direct link
between the cosmological CP-violation and the low energy Jarlskog invariant. We
predict new lower and upper bounds on the \theta_{13} mixing angle, 1^o <
\theta_{13} < 6^o. In addition, we reveal a new hidden symmetry that dictates
the solar mixing angle \theta_12 by its group-parameter, and includes the
conventional tri-bimaximal mixing as a special case, allowing deviations from
it.

government, the distribution of administrative responsibilities and the
allocation of public resources, they also influence the interregional flow of
information, cross-border trade operations, the diffusion of innovation and
technology, and the spatial spread of infectious diseases. However, as growing
interactions and mobility across long distances, cultural, and political
borders continue to amplify the small world effect and effectively decrease the
relative importance of local interactions, it is difficult to assess the
location and structure of effective borders that may play the most significant
role in mobility-driven processes. The paradigm of spatially coherent
communities may no longer be a plausible one, and it is unclear what structures
emerge from the interplay of interactions and activities across spatial scales.
Here we analyse a multi-scale proxy network for human mobility that
incorporates travel across a few to a few thousand kilometres. We determine an
effective system of geographically continuous borders implicitly encoded in
multi-scale mobility patterns. We find that effective large scale boundaries
define spatially coherent subdivisions and only partially coincide with
administrative borders. We find that spatial coherence is partially lost if
only long range traffic is taken into account and show that prevalent models
for multi-scale mobility networks cannot account for the observed patterns.
These results will allow for new types of quantitative, comparative analyses of
multi-scale interaction networks in general and may provide insight into a
multitude of spatiotemporal phenomena generated by human activity.

great potential for basic science, medicine, energy, and defense. We consider
here a new and general approach to isotope separation. The method is based on
an irreversible change of the mass-to-magnetic moment ratio of a particular
isotope in an atomic beam, followed by a magnetic multipole whose gradients
deflect and guide the atoms. The underlying mechanism is a reduction of the
entropy of the beam by the information of a single-scattered photon for each
atom that is separated. We numerically simulate isotope separation for a range
of examples, including lithium, for which we describe the experimental setup we
are currently constructing. Simulations of other examples demonstrate this
technique's general applicability to almost the entire periodic table. We show
that the efficiency of the process is only limited by the available laser
power, since one photon on average enables the separation of one atom. The
practical importance of the proposed method is that large-scale isotope
separation should be possible, using ordinary inexpensive magnets and the
existing technologies of supersonic beams and lasers.

found to be faster compared to the $^{56}$Co decay (i.e. 111.3 d), suggesting
that a proportion of $\gamma$-rays increasing with time have escaped without
thermalization, owing to the low mass nature of the ejecta. SN 2006gi has
almost identical post maximum decline phase luminosities as SN 1999ex, and
found to be similar to both SNe 1999dn and 1999ex in terms of the

restrictions on the time dependence of the mass, the specific Fock
representation of the canonical commutation relations which is naturally
associated with a massless free field provides a unitary dynamics even when the
time varying mass is present. Moreover, we demonstrate that this Fock
representation is the only acceptable one, up to unitary equivalence, if the
vacuum has to be SO(4)-invariant (i.e., invariant under the symmetries of the
field equation) and the dynamics is required to be unitary. In particular, the
analysis and uniqueness of the quantization can be applied to the treatment of
cosmological perturbations around Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes with
the spatial topology of the three-sphere, like e.g. for gravitational waves
(tensor perturbations). In addition, we analyze the extension of our results to
free fields with a time dependent mass defined on other compact spatial

proteins, our results show that SimIC efficiently addresses the shallow
annotation issue in GO, thus improves the correlations between GO similarities
of yeast proteins and their expression similarities as well as between GO
similarities of yeast proteins and their sequence similarities. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the proposed SimIC is superior in predicting yeast protein
interactions. We predict 20484 yeast protein-protein interactions (PPIs)

PPIs shows that all members of 159 MIPS complexes can be found in our PPI
predictions, which is more than those (120/214) found in PPIs predicted by
relative specificity similarity (RSS). Integrating IC and structural

We assume that both leptons and hadrons are accelerated up to relativistic

the electromagnetic spectrum through all main radiative processes. The
radiative contribution of secondary particles (pions, muons and
electron-positron pairs) is included. We use a set of simultaneous observations

determining the IMF. However, the effects and importance of radiative heating

more and more as cloud surface densities increase from those typical of low
mass star-forming regions like Taurus, through the typical surface density of
massive star-forming clouds in the Galaxy, up to conditions found only in super
star clusters. In regions of low surface density, fragmentation during collapse
leads to the formation of small clusters rather than individual massive star

of the harmonics as caused by relativistic effects fails because the
relativistic corrections are extremely small in this case. We suggest that the
features correspond to the peaks in the energy dependence of the free-free
opacity in a quantizing magnetic field, known as quantum oscillations. The
peaks arise when the transitions to new Landau levels become allowed with
increasing the photon energy; they are strongly enhanced by the square-root
singularities in the phase-space density of quantum states in the case when the
free (non-quantized) motion is effectively one-dimensional. To explore
observable properties of these quantum oscillations, we calculate models of
hydrogen neutron star atmospheres with B \sim 10^{10} - 10^{11} G (i.e.,
electron cyclotron energy E_{c,e} = 0.1 - 1 keV) and T_{eff} = 1 - 3 MK. Such

of spontaneously emitted and directly transmitted waves. The scattering problem
is solved in closed form for different level structures. Several possible
applications are discussed: The state of the emitter can be switched
deterministically by Raman scattering, thus enabling applications in quantum
computing such as a single photon transistor. An array of emitters gives rise
to a photonic band gap structure, which can be tuned by a classical driving
laser. A disordered array leads to Anderson localization of photons, where the
localization length can again be controlled by an external driving.

super-Earth requiring a significant atmosphere to explain its observed mass and
radius. Models for the structure of this planet predict that it likely
possesses a H-He envelope of at least 0.05% of the total mass of the planet.
However, models without a significant H-He atmosphere are not entirely ruled
out by the available data. Here we explore a range of possible atmospheres for
the planet, ranging from solar composition gas, to pure CO_2 or water (steam).
We present transmission and emission spectra for each of these cases. We find
that, if GJ 1214b possesses a hydrogen-rich atmosphere as expected, then the
primary transit depth for such an atmosphere would vary at a level of up to
0.3% as a function of wavelength, relative to the background light of its
M-dwarf host star. Observations at this level of precision are potentially
obtainable with current space-based instrumentation. Successful detection of
the transmission signature of this planet at the ~0.1% level would therefore
provide confirmation of the hydrogen-rich nature of the planetary atmosphere.
It follows that transmission spectroscopy at this level of precision could
provide a first glimpse into answering the question of whether planets in the
super-Earth mass regime (1 - 10 M_Earth) more closely resemble large
terrestrial planets or small gas giant planets.

distribution when cells undergo division. When a cell divides, both its volume
and LuxR protein copy number N are partitioned with slight asymmetries. We have
measured the distribution functions describing the partitioning of the protein
fluorescence and the cell volume. The fluorescence distribution is found to
narrow systematically as the LuxR population increases while the volume
partitioning is unchanged. Analyzing these changes statistically, we have
determined that N = 80-135 dimers at low cell density and 575 dimers at high

over a large (3,000) clonal population. Combining the static and time-lapse

cluster (GC) populations are the color-magnitude relation of the blue GCs (the
""blue tilt"") and the nonlinearity of the dependence of optical GC colors on
metallicity. The color-magnitude relation, interpreted as a mass-metallicity
relation, is thought to be a consequence of self-enrichment. Nonlinear
color-metallicity relations have been shown to produce bimodal color
distributions from unimodal metallicity distributions. We simulate GC
populations including both a mass-metallicity scaling relation and nonlinear
color-metallicity relations motivated by theory and observations. Depending on
the assumed range of metallicities and the width of the GC luminosity function
(GCLF), we find that the simulated populations can have bimodal color
distributions with a ""blue tilt"" similar to observations, even though the
metallicity distribution appears unimodal. The models that produce these
features have the relatively high mean GC metallicities and nearly equal blue
and red peaks characteristic of giant elliptical galaxies. The blue tilt is
less apparent in the models with metallicities typical of dwarf ellipticals;
the narrower GCLF in these galaxies has an even bigger effect in reducing the
significance of their color-magnitude slopes. We critically examine the
evidence for nonlinearity versus bimodal metallicities as explanations for the
characteristic double-peaked color histograms of giant ellipticals and conclude
that the question remains open. We discuss the prospects for further
theoretical and observational progress in constraining the models presented
here and for uncovering the true metallicity distributions of extragalactic
globular cluster systems.

Galactic cirrus contamination can be, even at optical and ultraviolet

$\chi^2$ minimization. The best-fitted values are then used to predict the
branching fractions of the singly-Cabibbo-suppressed (SCS) and

observe significant SU(3) breaking effects in some of SCS channels. In the case

completely determined based on currently available data. We conjecture that the

color-suppressed tree amplitudes extracted from the diagrammatical approach

us to discriminate between different solutions of topological amplitudes. For
the long-standing puzzle about the ratio $\Gamma(D^0\to

similar, however, the tidal features are bluer on average in NUV - g when

prominent relative to the disks in UV images compared to optical maps. This
effect is likely due to enhanced star formation in the tidal features compared

one where inflaton and curvaton belong to the hidden sector, which are coupled
to the Standard Model gauge sector very weakly. There is another class of
models of inflaton and curvaton, which are embedded within Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) gauge group and beyond, and whose origins
lie within gauge invariant combinations of supersymmetric quarks and leptons.
Their masses and couplings are all well motivated from low energy physics,

The PCA-ZDI approach. We use multi-line techniques, meaning that all the lines
of a stellar spectrum contribute to obtain a polarization signature. The use of
multiple lines dramatically increases the signal to noise ratio of these
polarizations signatures. Using one technique, the pseudo-line approach, we
construct the pseudo-line as the mean profile of all the individual lines. The
other technique, the PCA-ZDI approach proposed recently by Semel et al. (2006)
for the detection of polarized signals, combines Principle Components Analysis
(PCA) and the Zeeman Do ppler Imaging technique (ZDI). This new method has a
main advantage: the polarized signature is extracted using cross correlations
between the stellar spectra nd functions containing the polarization properties
of each line. These functions are the principal components of a database of
synthetic spectra. The synthesis of the spectra of the database are obtained
using the radiative transfer equations in LTE. The profiles built with the
PCA-ZDI technique are denominated Multi-Zeeman-Signatures. The construction of
the pseudo line as well as the Multi-Zeeman-Signatures is a powerful tool in
the study of stellar and solar magnetic fields. The information of the physical
parameters that governs the line formation is contained in the final polarized
profiles. In particular, using inversion codes, we have shown that the magnetic
field vector can be properly inferred with both approaches despite the magnetic
field regime.

similar to that in the AdS/CFT correspondence. Hence, it is legitimate to seek
a precise relation between these two different frameworks. In this lecture, I
will explain how the AdS/CFT correspondence is related to the RS braneworld

correspond to the CFT matter correction found in the AdS/CFT correspondence

error correcting capability in acyclic instantaneous networks within the

investigate the performance of CNECCs under the error model of the network
where the edges are assumed to be statistically independent binary symmetric
channels, each with the same probability of error $p_e$($0\leq p_e<0.5$). We
obtain bounds on the performance of such CNECCs based on a modified generating
function (the transfer function) of the CNECCs. For a given network, we derive
a mathematical condition on how small $p_e$ should be so that only single edge
network-errors need to be accounted for, thus reducing the complexity of
evaluating the probability of error of any CNECC. Simulations indicate that
convolutional codes are required to possess different properties to achieve
good performance in low $p_e$ and high $p_e$ regimes. For the low $p_e$ regime,
convolutional codes with good distance properties show good performance. For
the high $p_e$ regime, convolutional codes that have a good \textit{slope} (the
minimum normalized cycle weight) are seen to be good. We derive a lower bound

measurements has revealed the onset of a regime where large differences exist
between transport and magnetically measured values of the critical current
density and Birr. These effects, initially unexpected due to the lack of
crystalline texture in these in-situ processed strands, appear to be due to a
fibrous microstructure, connected with the details of the wire fabrication and
MgB2 formation reactions. Scanning electron micrographs of in-situ-processed
MgB2 monocore strands have revealed a fibrous microstructure. Grains (~100 nm)
are randomly oriented, and there is no apparent local texture of the grains.
However, this randomly oriented polycrystalline material has a fibrous texture
at a larger length scale, with stringers of MgB2 (~ 60 {\mu}m long and ~5
{\mu}m in diameter) partially separated by elongated pores -- the spaces
previously occupied by stringers of elemental Mg. This leads to an
interpretation of the differences observed in transport and magnetically
determined critical currents, in particular a large deviation between the two
at higher fields, in terms of different transverse and longitudinal
connectivities within the strand. The different values of connectivity also
lead to different resistive transition widths, and thus irreversibility field
values, as measured by transport and magnetic techniques. Finally, these
considerations are seen to influence estimated pinning potentials for the
strands.

tensor of the geometry is determined in terms of the Killing vector field and
its scalars. In this way we can generate all products and covariant derivatives

the field equations of Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG) and New Massive
Gravity (NMG) introduced recently. In particular when the scalars of the
Killing vector field (timelike, spacelike and null cases) are constants then
all three dimensional symmetric tensors of the geometry, the ricci and einstein
tensors, their covariant derivatives at all orders, their products of all
orders are completely determined by the Killing vector field and the metric.
Hence the corresponding three dimensional metrics are strong candidates of
solving all higher derivative gravitational field equations in three

form of abstract data types. For that purpose, we developed a particular type
of algebra, the seed algebra, which describes exactly the behavior of a process
within a labeled transition system. We have shown the possibility of
characterizing the bisimulation of two processes with the isomorphism of their
corresponding seed algebras. We pointed out that the traditional concept of
isomorphism of algebra does not apply here, because there is even no one-one
correspondence between the elements of two seed algebras. The lack of this
one-one correspondence comes from the non-deterministic choice of transitions
of a process. We introduce a technique of hidden operations to mask unwanted
details of elements of a seed algebra, which only reflect non-determinism or
other implicit control mechanism of process transition. Elements of a seed
algebra are considered as indistinguishable if they show the same behavior
after these unwanted details are masked. Each class of indistinguishable
elements is called a non-hidden closure. We proved that bisimulation of two
processes is equivalent to isomorphism of non-hidden closures of two seed
algebras representing these two processes. We call this kind of isomorphism a
deep isomorphism. We get different models of seed algebra by specifying
different axiom systems for the same signature. Each model corresponds to a
different kind of bisimulation. By proving the relations between these models
we also established relations between 10 different bisimulations, which form a
acyclic directed graph.

condensates composed by relativistic constituents. While such systems are not
yet a subject of experimental realization, they do provide us with a very rich
analogue model of gravity, characterized by several novel features with respect
to their non-relativistic counterpart. Relativistic condensates exhibit two
(rather than one) quasi-particle excitations, a massless and a massive one, the
latter disappearing in the non-relativistic limit. We show that the metric
associated with the massless mode is a generalization of the usual acoustic
geometry allowing also for non-conformally flat spatial sections. This is
relevant, as it implies that these systems can allow the simulation of a wider
variety of geometries. Finally, while in non-RBECs the transition is from
Lorentzian to Galilean relativity, these systems represent an emergent gravity
toy model where Lorentz symmetry is present (albeit with different limit
speeds) at both low and high energies. Hence they could be used as a test field
for better understanding the phenomenological implications of such a milder
form of Lorentz violation at intermediate energies.

observationally and therefore constrain a large body of analytic models of star

on the Gaussian process metamodel and two essential steps of its definition
phase. First, the initial design of the computer code input variables (which
allows to fit the metamodel) has to honor adequate space filling properties. We
adopt a numerical approach to compare the performance of different types of
space filling designs, in the class of the optimal Latin hypercube samples, in
terms of the predictivity of the subsequent fitted metamodel. We conclude that
such samples with minimal wrap-around discrepancy are particularly well-suited
for the Gaussian process metamodel fitting. Second, the metamodel validation
process consists in evaluating the metamodel predictivity with respect to the
initial computer code. We propose and test an algorithm which optimizes the
distance between the validation points and the metamodel learning points in
order to estimate the true metamodel predictivity with a minimum number of
validation points. Comparisons with classical validation algorithms and
application to a nuclear safety computer code show the relevance of this new

luminosity evolution is still sufficient to fit the wealth of available data on

distributions. However, the fit requires a luminosity-dependent decline of
source luminosities at high redshifts, at least for steep-spectrum sources,
thus confirming earlier indications of a ""downsizing"" also for radio sources.
The upturn of source counts at sub-mJy levels is accounted for by a
straightforward extrapolation, using the empirical far-IR/radio correlation, of
evolutionary models matching the far-IR counts and redshift distributions of
star-forming galaxies. We also discuss the implications of the new model for
the interpretation of data on large-scale clustering of radio sources and on
the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, and for the investigation of the

(DM) annihilations in the inelastic dark matter (iDM) scenario after the recent

have a large DM-nucleon cross section ($\sigma_n \sim$ 10$^{-4}$ pb in the
spin-independent (SI) scattering and $\sigma_n \sim$ 10 pb in the
spin-dependent (SD) scattering). The dominant contribution to the iDM capture
in the Sun is from scattering off Fe/Al in the SI/SD case. Current bounds from
Super-Kamiokande exclude the hard DM annihilation channels, such as $W^+W^-$,
$ZZ$, $t\bar{t}$ and $\tau^+ \tau^-$. For soft channels such as $b\bar{b}$ and
$c \bar{c}$, the limits are loose, but could be tested or further constrained
by future IceCube plus DeepCore. For neutrino constraints from the DM
annihilation in the Earth, due to the weaker gravitational effect of the Earth

Reimann, who studied multicontact structures for the homogeneous manifolds G/P,
where G is a semisimple Lie group and P is the minimal parabolic subgroup of G.
The multicontact structure here arises naturally by the nilpotent component N
of the Iwasawa decomposition of G, which is an open and dense subset of G/P. In
the thesis two problems are addressed.
  The first one concerns the representation of simple Lie algebras in terms of
polynomial algebras. More precisely, a polynomial basis for split simple Lie
algebras is explicitly given in a suitable choice of coordinates.
  The second problem investigates the multicontact structure on Hessenberg
manifolds. These manifolds can be locally viewed as quotient of the nilpotent
component in the Iwasawa decomposition of semisimple Lie groups. Then the
multicontact structure is inherited by the one in the Iwasawa nilpotent case.
Rigidity with respect to this structure is studied and proved for a large

of attosecond electron wave packets (WPs) that uses a free WP as a reference to
measure a bound WP. We demonstrate our method by exciting helium atoms using an
attosecond pulse with a bandwidth centered near the ionization threshold, thus
creating both a bound and a free WP simultaneously. After a variable delay, the
bound WP is ionized by a few-cycle infrared laser precisely synchronized to the
original attosecond pulse. By measuring the delay-dependent photoelectron
spectrum we obtain an interferogram that contains both quantum beats as well as
multi-path interference. Analysis of the interferogram allows us to determine
the bound WP components with a spectral resolution much better than the inverse
of the attosecond pulse duration.

open subset of a Carnot group G, then composition with $\phi$ preserves
Q-harmonic functions, where Q denotes the homogeneous dimension of G. Then they
combine this with a regularity theorem for Q-harmonic functions to show that
$\phi$ is in fact $C^\infty$. As an application, they observe that a Liouville
type theorem holds for some Carnot groups of step 2.
  In this article we argue, using the Engel group as an example, that a
Liouville type theorem can be proved for every Carnot group. Indeed, the fact
that 1-quasiconformal maps are smooth allows us to obtain a Liouville type
theorem by applying the Tanaka prolongation theory.

Relativity (SR) are unrelated theories, or instead, if the one implies the
other. I show how SR can be indeed derived from causality of QT, within the
computational paradigm ""the universe is a huge quantum computer"", reformulating
QFT as a Quantum-Computational Field Theory (QCFT). In QCFT SR emerges from the
fabric of the computational network, which also naturally embeds gauge
invariance. In this scheme even the quantization rule and the Planck constant
can in principle be derived as emergent from the underlying causal tapestry of
space-time. In this way QT remains the only theory operating the huge computer
of the universe. Is QCFT only a speculative tautology (theory as simulation of
reality), or does it have a scientific value? The answer will come from Occam's
razor, depending on the mathematical simplicity of QCFT. Here I will just start
scratching the surface of QCFT, analyzing simple field theories, including
Dirac's. The number of problems and unmotivated recipes that plague QFT
strongly motivates us to undertake the QCFT project, since QCFT makes all such
problems manifest, and forces a re-foundation of QFT.

combined rotations and vibrations of molecules formed through particle
localization in concentric polygonal rings, a correlated basis is constructed
that spans the translationally invariant part of the lower-Landau-level (LLL)
spectra. These trial functions, referred to as rovibrational molecular (RVM)
functions, generalize our previous work which focused exclusively on electronic
cusp states, describing them as pure vibrationless rotations. From a
computational viewpoint, the RVM correlated basis enables controlled and
systematic improvements of the original strongly-correlated variational wave
function. Conceptually, it provides the basis for the development of a quantal
molecular description for the full LLL spectra. This quantal molecular
description is universal, being valid for both bosons and fermions, for both
the yrast and excited states of the LLL spectra, and for both low and high
angular momenta. Furthermore, it follows that all other translationally
invariant trial functions (e.g., the Jastrow-Laughlin, compact
composite-fermion, or Moore-Read functions) are reducible to a description in
terms of an excited rotating/vibrating quantal molecule.

magnetic moments ($\sim$ 2.58 $\mu_B$) which play as pair breakers. While the
impurity scattering measured by $\rho_0$ in the Zn-doped samples is much
weaker, accompanied by a negligible pair breaking effect. A possible
explanation is that the impurity scattering by the Zn impurities are mainly
small angle scattering (or small momentum transfer), therefore it cannot break
the pairing induced by the interpocket scattering and thus affect the
superconducting transition temperature weakly.

same time, early in the Galaxy's history. 'Blue stragglers' are stars massive
enough that they should have evolved into white dwarfs long ago. Two possible
mechanisms have been proposed for their formation: mass transfer between binary
companions and stellar mergers resulting from direct collisions between two
stars. Recently, the binary explanation was claimed to be dominant. Here we
report that there are two distinct parallel sequences of blue stragglers in
M30. This globular cluster is thought to have undergone 'core collapse', during
which both the collision rate and the mass transfer activity in binary systems
would have been enhanced. We suggest that the two observed sequences arise from
the cluster core collapse, with the bluer population arising from direct
stellar collisions and the redder one arising from the evolution of close
binaries that are probably still experiencing an active phase of mass transfer.

particular, both instruments are attached to a field rotator. Obtaining truly
photometric data with such instruments present a significant challenge. In this
paper, we investigate in detail twilight flats taken with the FORS instruments.
We find that a large fraction of the structure seen in these flatfields rotates
with the field rotator.
  We discuss in detail the methods we use to determine the cause of this
effect. The effect was tracked down to be caused by the Linear Atmospheric
Dispersion Corrector (LADC). The results are thus of special interest for
designers of instruments with LADCs and developers of calibration plans and
pipelines for such instruments. The methods described here to find and correct
it, however, are of interest also for other instruments using a field rotator.
  If not properly corrected, this structure in the flatfield may degrade the
photometric accuracy of imaging observations taken with the FORS instruments by
adding a systematic error of up to 4% for broad band filters. We discuss
several strategies to obtain photometric images in the presence of rotating
flatfield pattern.
