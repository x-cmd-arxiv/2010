of broadband radio interferometers with low noise, moderate angular resolution,
high spectral resolution, and wide fields of view. With characteristics
somewhat different from traditional radio instruments, these interferometers
may require new calibration techniques in order to reach their design
sensitivities. Self-calibration or redundant calibration techniques that allow
an instrument to be calibrated off complicated sky emission structures are
ideal. In particular, the large number of redundant baselines possessed by
these new instruments makes redundant calibration an especially attractive
option. In this paper, we explore the errors and biases in existing redundant
calibration schemes through simulations, and show how statistical biases can be
eliminated. We also develop a general calibration formalism that includes both
redundant baseline methods and basic point source calibration methods as
special cases, and show how slight deviations from perfect redundancy and
coplanarity can be taken into account.

discuss the interactions of such relic particles with matter and comment on the

interact, via sterile-active mixing, with matter fermions by means of
electroweak currents, with the final state containing a relativistic active

the sterile neutrino mass and is enough to ionize atoms and flip the spins of

fails with a certain probability. The noncoherent relaying scheme is
considered, which corresponds to the case of zero forward-link channel state

shown equivalent to a Rayleigh fading channel, where we derive the

amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) strategies. Furthermore,
we show that the DF strategy is asymptotically optimal as the outage
probability $\epsilon$ goes to zero, with the AF strategy strictly suboptimal
over all signal to noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Regarding the rate loss due to
random attacks, the AF strategy suffers a less portion of rate loss than the DF
strategy in the high SNR regime, while the DF strategy demonstrates more robust
performance in the low SNR regime.

Principle for defining a local energy-momentum density for the gravitational

angular momentum as non-local observables that make sense, at best, for
extended domains of spacetime. After introducing Komar quantities associated
with spacetime symmetries, it is shown how total energy-momentum can be
unambiguously defined for isolated systems, providing fundamental tests for the
internal consistency of General Relativity as well as setting the conceptual
basis for the understanding of energy loss by gravitational radiation. Finally,

  Black Hole","Revised manuscript",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a model for launching relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei
(AGN) from an accreting Kerr black hole (BH) as an effect of the rotation of
the space-time, where the gravitational energy of the accretion disc inside the
ergosphere, which can be increased by the BH rotational energy transferred to
the disc via closed magnetic field lines that connect the BH to the disc
(BH-disc magnetic connection), is converted into jet energy. The main role of
the BH-disc magnetic connection is to provide the source of energy for the jets
when the mass accretion rate is very low. We assume that the jets are launched
from the disc inside the BH ergosphere, where the rotational effects of the
space-time become much stronger, being further accelerated by magnetic
processes. The rotation of the space-time channels a fraction of the disc
energy (i.e., the gravitational energy of the disc plus the rotational energy
of the BH which is deposited into the disc by magnetic connection) into a
population of particles that escape from the disc surfaces, carrying away mass,
energy and angular momentum in the form of jets, allowing the remaining disc
gas to accrete. In the limit of the spin-down power regime, the model proposed
here can be regarded as a variant of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, where the
BH rotational energy is transferred to the disc inside the ergosphere and then
used to drive the jets. We use general-relativistic conservation laws to
calculate the mass flow rate into the jets, the launching power of the jets and
the angular momentum transported by the jets for BHs with a spin parameter $a_*
\geqslant 0.95$. We found that a stationary state of the BH ($a_* = $ const)
can be reached if the mass accretion rate is larger than $\dot{m} \sim 0.001$.
In addition, the maximum AGN lifetime can be much longer than $\sim 10^{7}$ yr
when using the BH spin-down power.

towards generalizing the rich combinatorial structure of triangulations of

  We study triangulations of even-dimensional cyclic polytopes and tilting

summands of the cluster tilting module. We show that such tilting modules
correspond bijectively to triangulations. Moreover mutations of tilting modules
correspond to bistellar flips of triangulations.
  For any d-representation finite algebra we introduce a certain d-dimensional
cluster category and study its cluster tilting objects. For higher Auslander
algebras of linearly oriented type A we obtain a similar correspondence between
cluster tilting objects and triangulations of a certain cyclic polytope.
  Finally we study certain functions on generalized laminations in cyclic
polytopes, and show that they satisfy analogues of tropical cluster exchange
relations. Moreover we observe that the terms of these exchange relations are
closely related to the terms occuring in the mutation of cluster tilting

sensitively on scattering from microscopic disorder present in graphene
samples: electron waves traveling along different paths interfere, changing the
total conductance. Weak localization is produced by the coherent backscattering
of waves, while universal conductance fluctuations are created by summing over
all paths. In this work, we obtain conductance images of weak localization with
a liquid-He-cooled scanning probe microscope, by using the tip to create a
movable scatterer in a graphene device. This technique allows us to investigate
coherent transport with a probe of size comparable to the electron wavelength.
Images of magnetoconductance \textit{vs.} tip position map the effects of
disorder by moving a single scatterer, revealing how electron interference is
modified by the tip perturbation. The weak localization dip in conductivity at
B=0 is obtained by averaging magnetoconductance traces at different positions
of the tip-created scatterer. The width $\Delta B_{WL}$ of the dip yields an
estimate of the electron coherence length $L_\phi$ at fixed charge density.
This ""scanning scatterer"" method provides a new way of investigating coherent

result, we expect that dwarfs observed in the local Universe retain some
`memory' of the original seed mass distribution. Consequently, the properties
of MBHs in nearby dwarf galaxies may provide clean indicators of the efficiency
of MBH formation. In order to examine the properties of MBHs in dwarf galaxies,
we evolve different MBH populations within a Milky Way halo from high-redshift
to today. We consider two plausible MBH formation mechanisms: `massive seeds'
formed via gas-dynamical instabilities and a Population III remnant seed model.
`Massive seeds' have larger masses than PopIII remnants, but form in rarer
hosts. We dynamically evolve all halos merging with the central system, taking
into consideration how the interaction modifies the satellites, stripping their
outer mass layers. We compute different properties of the MBH population hosted
in these satellites. We find that for the most part MBHs retain the original
mass, thus providing a clear indication of what the properties of the seeds
were. We derive the black hole occupation fraction (BHOF) of the satellite
population at z=0. MBHs generated as `massive seeds' have large masses that
would favour their identification, but their typical BHOF is always below 40
per cent and decreases to less than per cent for observed dwarf galaxy sizes.
In contrast, Population III remnants have a higher BHOF, but their masses have
not grown much since formation, inhibiting their detection.

response and rheology, characterized by an intermittent stress-strain response

protocols this heterogeneous plastic flow was shown to be composed of plastic
events of various sizes. In this paper, through numerical study of a 2D LJ
amorphous solid, we generalize the study of the heterogeneous dynamics of
glassy materials to the finite shear-rate and temperature case. The global
mechanical response obtained through the use of Molecular Dynamics is shown to
converge to the quasistatic limit obtained with an energy minimization
protocol. The detailed analysis of the plastic deformation at different shear
rates shows that the glass follows different flow regimes. At sufficiently low
shear rates the mechanical response reaches a shear-rate independent regime
that exhibits all the characteristics of the quasistatic response (finite size
effects, yield stress...). At intermediate shear rates the rheological
properties are determined by the externally applied shear-rate. Finally at
higher shear the system reaches a shear-rate independent homogeneous regime.
The existence of these three regimes is also confirmed by the detailed analysis
of the atomic motion. The computation of the four-point correlation function
shows that the transition from the shear-rate dominated to the quasistatic
regime is accompanied by the growth of a dynamical cooperativity length scale
$\xi$ that is shown to diverge with shear rate. This divergence is compared
with the prediction of a simple model that assumes the diffusive propagation of
plastic events.

graphical structure, type of interaction at each node, and the Markovian
transition rates between nodes. For such systems, we ask the question ``What is
the most likely way for large currents to accumulate over time in a network
?'', where time is large compared to the system correlation time scale. We
identify two interesting regimes. In the first regime, in which the
accumulation of currents over time exceeds the expected value by a small to
moderate amount (moderate large deviation), we find that the large-deviation
distribution of currents is universal (independent of the interaction details),
and there is no long-time and averaged over time accumulation of particles
(condensation) at any nodes. In the second regime, in which the accumulation of
currents over time exceeds the expected value by a large amount (severe large
deviation), we find that the large-deviation current distribution is sensitive
to interaction details, and there is a long-time accumulation of particles
(condensation) at some nodes. The transition between the two regimes can be
described as a dynamical second order phase transition. We illustrate these
ideas using the simple, yet non-trivial, example of a single node with
feedback.

Helmholtz or Maxwell equations in piecewise homogeneous periodic materials.
Methods based on boundary integral equations are natural in this context, since
they discretize the interface alone and can achieve high order accuracy in
complicated geometries. In order to handle the quasi-periodic conditions which
are imposed on the unit cell, the free-space Green's function is typically
replaced by its quasi-periodic cousin. Unfortunately, the quasi-periodic
Green's function diverges for families of parameter values that correspond to
resonances of the empty unit cell. Here, we bypass this problem by means of a
new integral representation that relies on the free-space Green's function
alone, adding auxiliary layer potentials on the boundary of the unit cell
itself. An important aspect of our method is that by carefully including a few
neighboring images, the densities may be kept smooth and convergence rapid.
This framework results in an integral equation of the second kind, avoids
spurious resonances, and achieves spectral accuracy. Because of our image
structure, inclusions which intersect the unit cell walls may be handled easily
and automatically. Our approach is compatible with fast-multipole acceleration,
generalizes easily to three dimensions, and avoids the complication of
divergent lattice sums.

variations between first and second generation stars are tiny in most GCs
(~0.02-0.03 dex, comparable with typical observational errors). In addition,
(ii) using a large sample of red giants in M 4 with abundances from UVES
spectra from Marino et al. (2008), we find that Ca and Fe abundances in the two
populations of Na-poor and Na-rich stars are identical. These facts suggest
that the separation seen in color-magnitude diagrams using the U band or hk
index (as observed in NGC 1851 by Han et al. 2009) are not due to Ca
variations. Small differences in [Ca/H] as associated to hk variations might be
due to a small systematic effect in abundance analysis, because most
O-poor/Na-rich (He-rich) stars have slightly larger [Fe/H] (by 0.027 dex on
average, due to decreased H in the ratio) than first generation stars and are
then located at redder positions in the V,hk plane. While a few GCs (M 54,
omega Cen, M 22, maybe even NGC 1851) do actually show various degree of
metallicity spread, our findings eliminate the need of a close link between the
enrichment by core-collapse SNe with the mechanism responsible for the Na-O

find a significant increase in the mean EW of Halpha among star-forming dwarf

infalling dwarf galaxies undergoing a starburst phase. We identify these

  This relaxation is highly degenerate in the sense that the feasible set is

rise to this degeneracy in the SDP relaxation. In this paper, we take advantage
of the absence of the Slater constraint qualification and derive a technique

previously spectroscopic identified AGNs (~28%), we perform PSF subtractions
and find that on average the central point sources contribute less than one
third to the total luminosity, and that their high optical luminosities and
overall blue colors are apparently the result of star formation activity of the
host galaxies. Visual inspection of the SDSS images reveals a wide range of
disturbed morphologies. A detailed morphology analysis using Gini and M20
coefficients shows that slightly less than one half (~42% in g band) of the

heterogeneous distribution of ULIRGs in the G-M20 space is qualitatively
consistent with the results found by numerical simulations of disk-disk

demonstrate that these small-scale magnetic structures are inevitably required
to fit the linear polarization spectra; however, their presence cannot be
inferred from the Stokes I and V observations alone. Our magnetic Doppler
imaging analysis of alpha^2 CVn and previous results for 53 Cam support the
view that the upper main sequence stars can harbour fairly complex surface
magnetic fields which resemble oblique dipoles only at the largest spatial
scales. Spectra in all four Stokes parameters are absolutely essential to
unveil and meaningfully characterize this field complexity in Ap stars. We
therefore suggest that understanding magnetism of stars in other parts of the
H-R diagram is similarly incomplete without investigation of their linear
polarization spectra.

given by a map $f$, and let $\rho(A)$ denote the expectation value of a smooth
function $A$. If $f$ depends on a parameter, the derivative $\delta\rho(A)$ of
$\rho(A)$ with respect to the parameter is formally given by the value of the
so-called susceptibility function $\Psi(z)$ at $z=1$. When $f$ is a uniformly
hyperbolic diffeomorphism, it has been proved that the power series $\Psi(z)$
has a radius of convergence $r(\Psi)>1$, and that $\delta\rho(A)=\Psi(1)$, but
it is known that $r(\Psi)<1$ in some other cases. One reason why $f$ may fail
to be uniformly hyperbolic is if there are tangencies between the stable and
unstable manifolds for $(f,\rho)$. The present paper gives a crude,
nonrigorous, analysis of this situation in terms of the Hausdorff dimension $d$
of $\rho$ in the stable direction. We find that the tangencies produce
singularities of $\Psi(z)$ for $|z|<1$ if $d<1/2$, but only for $|z|>1$ if
$d>1/2$. In particular, if $d>1/2$ we may hope that $\Psi(1)$ makes sense, and
the derivative $\delta\rho(A)=\Psi(1)$ has thus a chance to be defined

formation rate around 30Msun/yr for a T=35K, beta=1.5 greybody far-infrared
SED. The good S/N permits stacking analyses for subgroups. We observe a trend
of star formation rate increasing with redshift. An increase of star formation
rate with AGN luminosity is indicated at the highest L_2-10>~1E44erg/s
luminosities only. Increasing trends with X-ray obscuration as expected in some
AGN evolutionary scenarios are not observed for the bulk of the X-ray AGN
sample but may be present for the highest intrinsic luminosity objects. This
suggests a transition between two modes in the coexistence of AGN activity and
star formation. For the bulk of the sample, the X-ray luminosity and
obscuration of the AGN are not intimately linked to the global star formation
rate of their hosts. The hosts are likely massive and forming stars secularly,
at rates similar to the pervasive star formation seen in massive galaxies
without an AGN at similar redshifts. The change indicated towards more intense
star formation, and a more pronounced increase in star formation rates between
unobscured and obscured AGN at highest luminosities suggests that luminous AGN
follow an evolutionary path on which obscured AGN activity and intense star
formation are linked, possibly via merging. Comparison to local hard X-ray
selected AGN supports this interpretation. [Abridged]

of the bulk. As a result, the value of the ionic density in the normal
direction and near to the surface shows some oscillations around the bulk
value. To describe this behavior in a simple way, we have formulated the
self-compressed inhomogeneous stabilized jellium model and have applied it to
simple metal thin films. In this model, for a $\nu$-layered slab, each ionic
layer is replaced by a jellium slice of constant density. The equilibrium
densities of the slices can be determined by minimizing the total energy per
electron of the slab with respect to the slice densities. To avoid the
complications that arise due to the number of independent slice-density
parameters for large-$\nu$ slabs, we consider a simplified version of the model
with three jellium slices: one inner bulk slice with density $\bar n_1$ and two
similar surface slices of densities $\bar n_2$. In this simplified model, each
slice may contain more than one ionic layer. Application of this model to the
$\nu$-layered slabs ($3\le\nu\le 10$) of Al, Na, and Cs shows that, in the
equilibrium state, $\bar n_1$ and $\bar n_2$ assume different values, which is
significant in the Al case, and the state is more stable than that predicted in
the homogeneous model in which only one global jellium density is used for the
whole system. In addition, we have calculated the overall relaxations, the work
functions, and the surface energies, and compared with the results of the
earlier works.
