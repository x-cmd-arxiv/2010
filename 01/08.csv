Type Ia supernova remnant 0519-69.0 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We used data
from both the Chandra ACIS and XMM-Newton EPIC-MOS instruments, and high
resolution X-ray spectra obtained with the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating
Spectrometer. The Chandra data show that there is a radial stratification of
oxygen, intermediate mass elements and iron, with the emission from more
massive elements more toward the center. Using a deprojection technique we
measure a forward shock radius of 4.0(3) pc and a reverse shock radius of
2.7(4) pc. We took the observed stratification of the shocked ejecta into
account in the modeling of the X-ray spectra with multi-component NEI models,
with the components corresponding to layers dominated by one or two elements.
An additional component was added in order to represent the ISM, which mostly
contributed to the continuum emission. This model fits the data well, and was
also employed to characterize the spectra of distinct regions extracted from
the Chandra data. From our spectral analysis we find that the fractional masses
of shocked ejecta for the most abundant elements are: M(O)=32%, M(Si/S)=7%/5%,
M(Ar+Ca)=1%, and M(Fe) = 55%. From the continuum component we derive a
circumstellar density of nH= 2.4(2)/cm^3. This density, together with the
measurements of the forward and reverse shock radii suggest an age of 450+/-200
yr,somewhat lower than, but consistent with the estimate based on the optical
light echo (600+/-200 yr). From the RGS spectra we measured a Doppler
broadening of sigma=1873+/-50 km/s, from implying a forward shock velocity of
vS = 2770+/-500 km/s. We discuss the results in the context of single
degenerate explosion models, using semi-analytical and numerical modeling, and
compare the characteristics of 0519-69.0 with those of other Type Ia supernova
remnants.

yielded multiple z>~7 dropout candidates. Supplemented by the Great Observatory
Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) Early Release Science (ERS) and further UDF
pointings, these data will provide crucial information about the most distant
known galaxies. However, achieving tight constraints on the z~7 galaxy
luminosity function (LF) will require even more ambitious photometric surveys.
Using a Fisher matrix approach to fully account for Poisson and cosmic sample
variance, as well as covariances in the data, we estimate the uncertainties on
LF parameters achieved by surveys of a given area and depth. Applying this
method to WFC3 z~7 dropout galaxy samples, we forecast the LF parameter
uncertainties for a variety of model surveys. We demonstrate that performing a
wide area (~1 deg^2) survey to H_AB~27 depth or increasing the UDF depth to
H_AB~30 provides excellent constraints on the high-z LF when combined with the
existing UDF GO and GOODS ERS data. We also show that the shape of the matter
power spectrum may limit the possible gain of splitting wide area (>~0.5 deg^2)
high-redshift surveys into multiple fields to probe statistically independent
regions; the increased root-mean-squared density fluctuations in smaller
volumes mostly offset the improved variance gained from independent samples.

W51e2 for three hydrogen radio recombination lines (H26\alpha, H53\alpha, and
H66\alpha) and absorption of two molecular lines of HCN(4-3) and CO(2-1). At
least four distinct continuum components have been detected in the 3"" region of
W51e2 from the SMA continuum images at 0.85 and 1.3 mm with resolutions of
0.3""x0.2"" and 1.4""x0.7"", respectively. The west component, W51e2-W, coincides
with the UC HII region reported from previous radio observations. The H26\alpha
line observation reveals an unresolved hyper-compact ionized core (<0.06"" or
<310 AU) with a high electron temperature of 1.2x10^4 K, with corresponding
emission measure EM>7x10^{10} pc cm^{-6} and electron density N_e>7x10^6
cm^{-3}. The inferred Lyman continuum flux implies that the HII region W51e2-W
requires a newly formed massive star, an O8 star or a cluster of B-type stars,
to maintain the ionization. The east component, W51e2-E, has a total mass of
~140 M_{\sun} according to our SED analysis and a large infall rate of >
1.3x10^{-3} M_{\sun}yr^{-1} inferred from the absorption of HCN. W51e2-E
appears to be the accretion center in W51e2 and to host one or more growing
massive proto-stars. Located 2"" northwest from W51e2-E, W51e2-NW is not
detected in the continuum emission at \lambda>=7 mm. Along with the maser
activities previously observed, our analysis suggests that W51e2-NW is at an
earlier phase of star formation. W51e2-N is located 2"" north of W51e2-E and has
only been detected at 1.3 mm with a lower angular resolution (~1""), suggesting
that it is a primordial, massive gas clump in the W51e2 complex.

black hole and the orbital angular momentum can occur during the supernova
explosion that forms the compact object. In this letter we present population
synthesis models of Galactic black hole X-ray binaries, and study the
probability density function of the misalignment angle, and its dependence on
our model parameters. In our modeling, we also take into account the evolution
of misalignment angle due to accretion of material onto the black hole during
the X-ray binary phase. The major factor that sets the misalignment angle for
X-ray binaries is the natal kick that the black hole may receive at its
formation. However, large kicks tend to disrupt binaries, while small kicks
allow the formation of XRBs and naturally select systems with small
misalignment angles. Our calculations predict that the majority (>67%) of
Galactic field BH XRBs have rather small (>10 degrees) misalignment angles,
while some systems may reach misalignment angles as high as ~90 degrees and
even higher. This results is robust among all population synthesis models. The
assumption of small small misalignment angles is extensively used to
observationally estimate black hole spin magnitudes, and for the first time we
are able to confirm this assumption using detailed population synthesis
calculations.

investigate the effect of local dispersal on the structure and function of
communities in which species are linked through an interaction web comprising
mutualism, competition and exploitation. Our results show that function,
diversity and interspecific interactions of locally linked communities undergo
a phase transition with changes in the rate of species dispersal. We find that
low spatial interconnectedness favors the spontaneous emergence of strongly
mutualistic communities which are more stable but less productive and diverse.
On the other hand, high spatial interconnectedness promotes local biodiversity
at the expense of local stability and supports communities with a wide range of
interspecific interactions. We argue that investigations of the relationship
between spatial processes and the self-organization of complex interaction webs
are critical to understanding the geographic structure of interactions in real
landscapes.

classes of homeomorphisms of the genus g >= 2 surface S_g with a marked point,
acting trivially on H := H_1(S_g). In 1983 Johnson constructed a beautiful
family of invariants tau_i: H_i(I_g,*) -> /\^{i+2} H for 0 <= i <= 2g-2, using
a kind of Abel-Jacobi map for families, in order to detect nontrivial cycles in
I_g,*. Johnson proved that tau_1 is an isomorphism rationally, and asked if the
same is true for tau_i with i > 1.
  The goal of this paper is to introduce various methods for computing tau_i;
in particular we prove that tau_i is not injective (even rationally) for any 2
<= i < g, and that tau_2 is surjective. For g >= 3, we find enough classes in
the image of tau_i to deduce that H_i(I_g,*, Q) is nonzero for each 1 <= i < g,
in contrast with mapping class groups. Many of our classes are stable, so we
can deduce that H_i(I_infty,1, Q) is infinite-dimensional for each i >= 1.

ESO/GOODS program in the CDFS, which complements the FORS2 ESO/GOODS
spectroscopic campaign. The GOODS/VIMOS spectroscopic campaign is structured in
two separate surveys using two different VIMOS grisms. The VIMOS Low Resolution
Blue (LR-Blue) and Medium Resolution (MR) orange grisms have been used to cover
different redshift ranges. The LR-Blue campaign is aimed at observing galaxies
mainly at 1.8<z<3.5, while the MR campaign mainly aims at galaxies at z<1 and
Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z>3.5. The full GOODS/VIMOS spectroscopic
campaign consists of 20 VIMOS masks. This release adds 8 new masks to the
previous release (12 masks, Popesso et al. 2009). In total we obtained 5052
spectra, 3634 from the 10 LR-Blue masks and 1418 from the 10 MR masks. A
significant fraction of the extracted spectra comes from serendipitously
observed sources: ~21% in the LR-Blue and ~16% in the MR masks. We obtained
2242 redshifts in the LR-Blue campaign and 976 in the MR campaign for a total
success rate of 62% and 69% respectively, which increases to 66% and 73% if
only primary targets are considered. The typical redshift uncertainty is
estimated to be ~0.0012 (~255 km/s) for the LR-Blue grism and ~0.00040 (~120
km/s) for the MR grism. By complementing our VIMOS spectroscopic catalog with
all existing spectroscopic redshifts publicly available in the CDFS, we
compiled a redshift master catalog with 7332 entries, which we used to
investigate large scale structures out to z~3.7. We produced stacked spectra of
LBGs in a few bins of equivalent width (EW) of the Ly-alpha and found evidence
for a lack of bright LBGs with high EW of the Ly-alpha. Finally, we obtained
new redshifts for 12 X-ray sources of the CDFS and extended-CDFS.

stars has resulted in improvements of the physics in the stellar structure and
evolution models of massive stars. Further asteroseismic constraints can be
obtained from studying ensembles of stars in a young open cluster, which all
have similar age, distance and chemical composition.
  AIMS: To improve our comprehension of the beta Cep stars, we studied the
young open cluster NGC 884 to discover new B-type pulsators, besides the two
known beta Cep stars, and other variable stars.
  METHODS: An extensive multi-site campaign was set up to gather accurate CCD
photometry time series in four filters (U, B, V, I) of a field of NGC884.
Fifteen different instruments collected almost 77500 CCD images in 1286 hours.
The images were calibrated and reduced to transform the CCD frames into
interpretable differential light curves. Various variability indicators and
frequency analyses were applied to detect variable stars in the field. Absolute
photometry was taken to deduce some general cluster and stellar properties.
  RESULTS: We achieved an accuracy for the brightest stars of 5.7 mmag in V,
6.9 mmag in B, 5.0 mmag in I and 5.3 mmag in U. The noise level in the
amplitude spectra is 50 micromag in the V band. Our campaign confirms the
previously known pulsators, and we report more than one hundred new multi- and
mono-periodic B-, A- and F-type stars. Their interpretation in terms of
classical instability domains is not straightforward, pointing to imperfections
in theoretical instability computations. In addition, we have discovered six
new eclipsing binaries and four candidates as well as other irregular variable
stars in the observed field.

two-dimensional case, the integral equation for the pseudo-energy becomes
transcendentally algebraic, and we can easily compute the various universal

induced spin polarizations. Local spin polarizations generated by electric
currents passing through a spin-orbit coupled mesoscopic system are measured by
an external probe. The electrochemical and spin-dependent chemical potentials
on the probe are controllable and tuned to values ensuring that neither charge
nor spin current flow between the system and the probe, on time-average. For
the relevant case of a single-channel probe, we find that the resulting
potentials are exactly independent of the transparency of the contact between
the probe and the system. Assuming that spin relaxation processes are absent in
the probe, we therefore identify the local spin-dependent potentials in the
sample at the probe position, and hence the local current-induced spin
polarization, with the spin-dependent potentials in the probe itself. The
statistics of these local chemical potentials is calculated within random
matrix theory. While they vanish on spatial and mesoscopic average, they
exhibit large fluctuations, and we show that single systems typically have spin
polarizations exceeding all known current-induced spin polarizations by a
parametrically large factor. Our theory allows to calculate quantum
correlations between spin polarizations inside the sample and spin currents
flowing out of it. We show that these large polarizations correlate only weakly
with spin currents in external leads, and that only a fraction of them can be
converted into a spin current in the linear regime of transport, which is
consistent with the mesoscopic universality of spin conductance fluctuations.
We numerically confirm the theory.

localized bubbles (gluonic hot spots) which initially contain 3-4 partons
composed of almost entirely gluons. The bubbles emitted correlated particles at
kinetic freezeout, leading to a lumpy fireball surface. For a selection of
charged particles (0.8 GeV/c $<$ $p_t$ $<$ 4.0 GeV/c), the PBM reasonably
quantitatively (within a few percent) explained high precision RHIC
experimental correlation analyses in a manner which was consistent with the
small observed HBT source size in this transverse momentum range. We
demonstrated that surface emission from a distributed set of surface sources
(as in the PBM) was necessary to obtain this consistency. In this paper we give
a review of the above comparison to central Au Au collisions. The bubble
formation can be associated with gluonic objects predicted by a Glasma Flux
Tube Model (GFTM) that formed longitudinal flux tubes in the transverse plane
of two colliding sheets of Color Glass Condensate (CGC), which pass through one
another. These sheets create boost invariant flux tubes of longitudinal color
electric and magnetic fields. A blast wave gives the tubes near the surface
transverse flow in the same way it gave transverse flow to the bubbles in the
PBM. In the GFTM the longitudinal color electric and magnetic fields have a
non-zero topological charge density $F \widetilde F$. These fields cause a
local strong CP violation which effects charged particle production coming from

physics of disordered systems, as well as geometrical problems such as polymers
and percolation. Steady progress has shown that these CFTs should be
logarithmic, with indecomposable operator product expansions, and
indecomposable representations of the Virasoro algebra. In one of the earliest
papers on the subject, V. Gurarie introduced a single parameter b to quantify
this indecomposability in terms of the logarithmic partner t of the stress
energy tensor T. He and A. Ludwig conjectured further that b=-5/8 for polymers
and b=5/6 for percolation. While a lot of physics may be hidden behind this
parameter - which has also given rise to a lot of discussions - it had remained
very elusive up to now, due to the lack of available methods to measure it
experimentally or numerically, in contrast say with the central charge. We show
in this paper how to overcome the many difficulties in trying to measure b.
This requires control of a lattice scalar product, lattice Jordan cells,
together with a precise construction of the state L_{-2}|0>. The final result
is that b=5/6 for polymers. For percolation, we find that b=-5/8 within an XXZ
or supersymmetric representation. In the geometrical representation, we do not
find a Jordan cell for L_0 at level two (finite-size Hamiltonian and transfer
matrices are fully diagonalizable), so there is no b in this case.

progressively heavier elements in their centres, up to inert iron. The core
then gravitationally collapses to a neutron star or a black hole, leading to an
explosion -- an iron-core-collapse supernova (SN). In contrast, extremely
massive stars (M_{initial} > 140 M_{solar}), if such exist, have oxygen cores
which exceed M_{core} = 50 M_{solar}. There, high temperatures are reached at
relatively low densities. Conversion of energetic, pressure-supporting photons
into electron-positron pairs occurs prior to oxygen ignition, and leads to a
violent contraction that triggers a catastrophic nuclear explosion. Tremendous
energies (>~ 10^{52} erg) are released, completely unbinding the star in a
pair-instability SN (PISN), with no compact remnant. Transitional objects with
100 M_{solar} < M_{initial} < 140 M_{solar}, which end up as iron-core-collapse
supernovae following violent mass ejections, perhaps due to short instances of
the pair instability, may have been identified. However, genuine PISNe, perhaps
common in the early Universe, have not been observed to date. Here, we present
our discovery of SN 2007bi, a luminous, slowly evolving supernova located
within a dwarf galaxy (~1% the size of the Milky Way). We measure the exploding
core mass to be likely ~100 M_{solar}, in which case theory unambiguously
predicts a PISN outcome. We show that >3 M_{solar} of radioactive 56Ni were
synthesized, and that our observations are well fit by PISN models. A PISN
explosion in the local Universe indicates that nearby dwarf galaxies probably
host extremely massive stars, above the apparent Galactic limit, perhaps
resulting from star formation processes similar to those that created the first
stars in the Universe.

cosmological observations without the need for dark energy. Generally, these
models imply inhomogeneous matter distributions alter the observable relations
that are taken for granted when assuming the Universe evolves according to the
standard Friedmann equations. Moreover, it has recently been shown that both
inhomogeneous matter and pressure distributions are required in both early and
late stages of cosmological evolution. These associated pressure gradients are
required in the early Universe to sufficiently describe void formation, whilst
late-stage pressure gradients stop the appearance of anomalous singularities.
In this paper we investigate the effect of pressure gradients on cosmological
observations by deriving the luminosity distance - redshift relations in
spherically symmetric, inhomogeneous spacetimes endowed with a perfect fluid.
By applying this to a specific example for the energy density distribution and
using various equations of state, we are able to explicitly show that pressure
gradients may have a non-negligble effect on cosmological observations. In
particular, we show that a non-zero pressure gradient can imply significantly
different residual Hubble diagrams for $z\lesssim1$ compared to when the
pressure is ignored. This paper therefore highlights the need to properly
consider pressure gradients when interpreting cosmological observations.

of turbulence in the post-shock region and in the intra-cluster medium (ICM).
The computations were done with the grid-based, adaptive mesh refinement hydro
code Enzo, using an especially designed refinement criteria for refining
turbulent flows in the vicinity of shocks. A substantial amount of turbulence
energy is injected in the ICM due to major merger. Our simulations show that
the shock launched after a major merger develops an ellipsoidal shape and gets
broken by the interaction with the filamentary cosmic web around the merging
cluster. The size of the post-shock region along the direction of shock
propagation is about 300 kpc h^-1, and the turbulent velocity dispersion in
this region is larger than 100 km s^-1. Scaling analysis of the turbulence
energy with the cluster mass within our cluster sample is consistent with
M^(5/3), i.e. the scaling law for the thermal energy in the self-similar
cluster model. This clearly indicates the close relation between virialization
and injection of turbulence in the cluster evolution. We found that the ratio
of the turbulent to total pressure in the cluster core within 2 Gyr after the
major merger is larger than 10%, and it takes about 4 Gyr to get relaxed, which
is substantially longer than typically assumed in the turbulent re-acceleration
models, invoked to explain the statistics of observed radio halos. Striking
similarities in the morphology and other physical parameters between our
simulations and the ""symmetrical radio relics"" found at the periphery of the

the zero gap band-structure AGNRs. By solving the Dirac equation with the
adequate boundary condition we show that due to the shifting of the DP a gap
opens in the spectra. This gap scale with the square of the rate between the
high and the wavelength of the deformation. We confirm this prediction by exact
numerical solution of the finite width rippled AGNR. Moreover, we find that the
quantum conductance, calculated by the non equilibrium Green's function
technique vanish when the gap open. The main conclusion of our results is that
a conductance gap should appear for all undoped corrugated AGNR independent of
their width.

been widely used by botnets to recruit new bots. In this work, we attempt to
quantify the infection ability of individual hosts and reveal the key
characteristics of the underlying topology formed by worm infection, i.e., the
number of children and the generation of the worm infection family tree.
Specifically, we first apply probabilistic modeling methods and a sequential
growth model to analyze the infection tree of a wide class of worms. We
analytically and empirically find that the number of children has
asymptotically a geometric distribution with parameter 0.5. As a result, on
average half of infected hosts never compromise any vulnerable host, over 98%
of infected hosts have no more than five children, and a small portion of
infected hosts have a large number of children. We also discover that the
generation follows closely a Poisson distribution and the average path length
of the worm infection family tree increases approximately logarithmically with
the total number of infected hosts. Next, we empirically study the infection
structure of localized-scanning worms and surprisingly find that most of the
above observations also apply to localized-scanning worms. Finally, we apply
our findings to develop bot detection methods and study potential
countermeasures for a botnet (e.g., Conficker C) that uses scan-based peer
discovery to form a P2P-based botnet. Specifically, we demonstrate that
targeted detection that focuses on the nodes with the largest number of
children is an efficient way to expose bots. For example, our simulation shows
that when 3.125% nodes are examined, targeted detection can reveal 22.36% bots.
However, we also point out that future botnets may limit the maximum number of
children to weaken targeted detection, without greatly slowing down the speed
of worm infection.

elongated halo of likely members to a radius of nearly 60'. Our measured core
radius of Rcore = 8.'24+/-0.'60 is somewhat larger than that of previous
estimates. We attribute the larger core radius measurement to the SDSS probing
lower mass main sequence stars than has been done before for similar studies of
M67, and the exclusion of post main sequence M67 members in the SDSS sample. We
estimate the number of M67 members in our SDSS sample to be 1385+/-67 stars. A
lower limit on the binary fraction in M67 is measured to be 45%. A higher
fraction of binary stars is measured in the core as compared to the halo, and
the luminosity function of the core is found to be more depleted of low-mass
stars. Thus the halo is consistent with mass segregation within the cluster.
The galactic orbit of M67 is calculated from recent proper motion and radial
velocity determinations. The elongated halo is roughly aligned to the proper
motion of the cluster. This appears to be a result of mass segregation due to
the galactic tidal field. Our algorithm is run on 2MASS photometry to directly
compare to previous studies of M67. Decreasing core radii are found for stars
with greater masses. We test the accuracy of our algorithm using 1000
artificial cluster Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that the matched filter

We
have investigated in the presence of a magnetic field several unusual
properties of single electron states near the Fermi level of such a
rectangular-shaped graphene dot with two zigzag and two armchair edges. We find
that a quasi-degenerate level forms near zero energy and the number of states
in this level can be tuned by the magnetic field. The wavefunctions of states
in this level are all peaked on the zigzag edges with or without some weight
inside the dot. Some of these states are magnetic field-independent surface
states while the others are field-dependent. We have found a scaling result
from which the number of magnetic field-dependent states of large dots can be
inferred from those of smaller dots.

presented. This calibration-free approach is based on an all-atom description
for bionanosystems, a universal interatomic force field, and a multiscale
perspective. The supramillion-atom nature of these bionanosystems prohibits the
use of a direct molecular dynamics approach for phenomena like viral structural
transitions or self-assembly that develop over milliseconds or longer. A key
element of these multiscale systems is the cross-talk between, and consequent
strong coupling of, processes over many scales in space and time. We elucidate
the role of interscale cross-talk and overcome bionanosystem simulation
difficulties with automated construction of order parameters (OPs) describing
supra-nanometer scale structural features, construction of OP dependent
ensembles describing the statistical properties of atomistic variables that
ultimately contribute to the entropies driving the dynamics of the OPs, and the
derivation of a rigorous equation for the stochastic dynamics of the OPs. Since
the atomic scale features of the system are treated statistically, several
ensembles are constructed that reflect various experimental conditions. The
theory provides a basis for a practical, quantitative bionanosystem modeling
approach that preserves the cross-talk between the atomic and nanoscale
features. A method for integrating information from nanotechnical experimental
data in the derivation of equations of stochastic OP dynamics is also
introduced.

successful in countless many computer vision applications. For example, image
categorization often relies on uniform voting among the nearest prototypes in

leveraged k-NN, thus generalizing the classic k-NN rule. We redefine the voting
rule as a strong classifier that linearly combines predictions from the k
closest prototypes. Weak classifiers are learned by UNN so as to minimize a
surrogate risk. A major feature of UNN is the ability to learn which prototypes
are the most relevant for a given class, thus allowing one for effective data
reduction. Experimental results on the synthetic two-class dataset of Ripley
show that such a filtering strategy is able to reject ""noisy"" prototypes. We
carried out image categorization experiments on a database containing eight

ground-state phase with zero magnetization. Examining the low-temperature
behavior of \chi and \xi, in the limit T \to 0 both quantities diverge
exponentially, i.e., \chi \propto \exp(b/T) and \xi \propto\exp(b/2T),
respectively. We find a linear decrease of the coefficient b with increasing
frustration according to b=-(\pi/2)(J1+2J2), i.e., the exponential divergence

low-temperature maximum in the specific heat when approaching the critical

the maximum likelihood method, with the likelihood compressed in a way that the
information stored in the spectral fluxes is conserved. The compressed data are
given by the size of the number of parameters, rather than by the number of
flux points. The optimum speed-up reached by the compression is the ratio of
the data set to the number of parameters. The method has been tested on a
sample of low-resolution spectra from the Sloan Extension for Galactic
Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) survey for the estimate of metallicity,
effective temperature and surface gravity, with accuracies of 0.24 dex, 130K
and 0.5 dex, respectively. Our stellar parameters and those recovered by the
SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline agree reasonably well. A small sample of
high-resolution VLT-UVES spectra were also used to test the method and the
results have been compared to a more classical approach. The speed and
multi-resolution capability of MAx combined with its performance compared with
other methods indicates that it will be a useful tool for the analysis of
upcoming spectral surveys.

polynomial in the number of underlying independent variables (not events!), and
can thus be used to give efficient constructions in cases where the underlying
proof applies the LLL to super-polynomially many events (or where finding a bad

applications including: the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for
the Santa Claus problem, as well as efficient algorithms for acyclic edge

powerful, relativistic jets that escape the system. In the case of supermassive
black holes at the centres of galaxies this has been known for decades, but for
stellar-mass black holes residing within galaxies like our own, it has taken
recent advances to arrive at this conclusion. Here, a review is given of the
evidence that supports the existence of jets from accreting stellar-mass black
holes, from observations made at optical and infrared wavelengths. In
particular it is found that on occasion, jets can dominate the emission of
these systems at these wavelengths. In addition, the interactions between the
jets and the surrounding matter produce optical and infrared emission on large
scales via thermal and non-thermal processes. The evidence, implications and
applications in the context of jet physics are discussed. It is shown that many
properties of the jets can be constrained from these studies, including the
total kinetic power they contain. The main conclusion is that like the
supermassive black holes, the jet kinetic power of accreting stellar-mass black
holes is sometimes comparable to their bolometric radiative luminosity. Future
studies can test ubiquities in jet properties between objects, and attempt to
unify the properties of jets from all observable accreting black holes, i.e. of
all masses.

photometric observations of nova V574 Pup during its 2004 outburst. The
observations were obtained over four months, starting from 2004 November 25
(four days after the nova outburst) to 2005 March 20. The near-IR JHK light
curve is presented - no evidence is seen from it for dust formation to have
occurred during our observations. In the early decline phase, the JHK spectra
of the nova are dominated by emission lines of hydrogen Brackett and Paschen
series, OI, CI and HeI. We also detect the fairly uncommon Fe II line at 1.6872
micron in the early part of our observations. The strengths of the HeI lines at
1.0830 micron and 2.0585 micron are found to become very strong towards the end
of the observations indicating a progression towards higher excitation
conditions in the nova ejecta. The width of the emission lines do not show any
significant change during the course of our observations. The slope of the
continuum spectrum was found to have a lambda^{-2.75} dependence in the early
stages which gradually becomes flatter with time and changes to a free-free
spectral dependence towards the later stages. Recombination analysis of the HI
lines shows deviations from Case B conditions during the initial stages.
However, towards the end of our observations, the line strengths are well
simulated with case B model values with electron density n_e = 10^{9-10}
cm^{-3} and a temperature equal to 10^4 K. Based on our distance estimate to
the nova of 5.5 kpc and the observed free-free continuum emission in the later
part of the observations, we estimate the ionized mass of the ejecta to be
between 10^{-5} and 10^{-6} solar-mass.

several baryon resonances at $M\sim 2.0-2.9$ GeV. Moreover, the model gives us
the double pole structure (i.e. two poles with the same Re$M$ but different

cosmological signal down to the limit imposed by cosmic variance. Contributions
to the errors come from the remaining cosmological signal, that integrates down
with the number of clusters, and the instrumental noise, that scales with the
number of pixels; the latter decreases with integration time and is subdominant
for the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 5-year data. It is proven both
analytically and numerically that the errors for 5-year WMAP data are $\simeq
15\sqrt{3/N_{\rm clusters}} \mu$K per dipole component. The measured bulk flow
velocity is significant at up to the $>99.95%$ confidence level, depending on
the cluster sample. We discuss different methods to compute error bars and
demonstrate that they have biases that would overpredict the errors, as is the
case in a recent reanalysis of our earlier results. If the signal is caused by
systematic effects present in the data, such systematics must have a dipole
pattern, which correlates with cluster X-ray luminosity and is present only at
cluster positions. Only contributions from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect could
provide such contaminants via several potential effects. We discuss such
candidates apart from the bulk-motion of the cluster samples and demonstrate

that asymptotically the order should be $n^{2/3}$, while Waterman conjectured

we determine the order of the fluctuation of the LCS for a special model of

on the set $\{l-1,l,l+1\}$, with $l$ a given positive integer. We showed that
the fluctuation in this model is asymptotically of order $n$, which confirm

(relatively) low dimensional optimization problem.

up to 50% relative to unscreened HF. In general GW overscreens the HF energies

the various phases of the Galactic Centre interstellar medium (including

propagation of light in a static magnetic field could be used to place bounds
on the fundamental coupling in that theory. Such a framework has many

allows an exact solution of the orbit, with very tight error limits. Nine
outbursts from both the historical photographic records as well as from recent
photometric measurements have been used as fixed points of the solution: 1913,
1947, 1957, 1973, 1983, 1984, 1995, 2005 and 2007 outbursts. This allows the

the Einstein's value $q = 1$. This supports the $no-hair theorem$ of black

interference in a triple quantum dot (TQD) capacitively coupled to the MR. The
TQD connected to three electrodes is an electronic analog of a three-level atom
in $\Lambda$ configuration. The electrons can tunnel from the left electrode
into one of the two dots with lower-energy states, but can only tunnel out from
the higher-energy state at the third dot to the right electrode. When the two
lower-energy states are tuned to be degenerate, an electron in the TQD can be
trapped in a superposition of the degenerate states called the dark state. This
effect is caused by the destructive quantum interference between tunneling from
the two lower-energy states to the higher-energy state. Under this condition,
an electron in the dark state readily absorbs an energy quantum from the MR.
Repeating this process, the MR can be cooled to its ground state. Moreover, we
propose a scheme for verifying the cooling result by measuring the current
spectrum of a charge detector adjacent to a double quantum dot coupled to the
MR.

reconstructed by the Meso-NH model with better performances than what has been
achieved with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF)

resolution-dependent and it has been proved that a grid-nesting configuration
(3 domains) with a high horizontal resolution (1km) for the innermost domain is
necessary to reconstruct all the optical turbulence features with a good
correlation to measurements. High resolution simulations provided an averaged
surface layer thickness just ~14 m higher than what is estimated by
measurements, the seeing in the free atmosphere showed a dispersion from the
observed one of just a few hundredths of an arcsecond (~0.05""). The unique
limitation of the previous study was that the optical turbulence in the surface
layer appeared overestimated by the model in both low and high resolution
modes. In this study we present the results obtained with an improved numerical
configuration. The same 15 nights have been simulated, and we show that the

thermodynamics with Unruh temperature verified by computing the boundary stress

a way that they become the dual of an accelerated quark and a meson in
Minkowski space, respectively. Using the standard procedure of holographic
renormalization, we calculate the chiral condensate, and also the spectral
functions for both the accelerated quark and meson. Especially, we extract the
corresponding strength of random force of the Langevin dynamics and observe
that it can characterize the phase transition of meson melting. This result
raises an issue toward a formulation of complementarity principle for the
Rindler horizon. We find most of the dynamical features are qualitatively
similar to the ones in the thermal bath dual to the AdS black hole background,

detected from Mkn 421 on all observation nights. The flux (E > 250 GeV) varied
on night-by-night basis between (0.92+-0.11)10^-10 cm^-2 s^-1 (0.57 Crab units)
and (3.21+-0.15)10^-10 cm^-2 s^-1 (2.0 Crab units) in 2006 April. There is a
clear indication for intra-night variability with a doubling time of
36+-10(stat) minutes on the night of 2006 April 29, establishing once more
rapid flux variability for this object. For all individual nights gamma-ray
spectra could be inferred, with power-law indices ranging from 1.66 to 2.47. We
did not find statistically significant correlations between the spectral index
and the flux state for individual nights. During the June 2006 campaign, a flux
substantially lower than the one measured by the Whipple 10-m telescope four
days later was found. Using a log-parabolic power law fit we deduced for some
data sets the location of the spectral peak in the very-high energy regime. Our
results confirm the indications of rising peak energy with increasing flux, as
expected in leptonic acceleration models.

luminosity ranges or having different morphological types are different. These
characteristics or `marks' permit to understand the galaxy catalogs that carry
all this information as realizations of marked point processes. Many attempts
have been presented to quantify the dependence of the clustering of galaxies on
their inner properties. The present paper summarizes methods on spatial marked
statistics used in cosmology to disentangle luminosity, colour or morphological
segregation and introduces a new one in this context, the mark connection
function. The methods used here are the partial correlation functions,
including the cross-correlation function, the normalised mark correlation
function, the mark variogram and the mark connection function. All these
methods are applied to a volume-limited sample drawn from the 2dFGRS, using the
spectral type as the mark. We show the virtues of each method to provide
information about the clustering properties of each population, the dependence
of the clustering on the marks, the similarity of the marks as a function of
the pair distances, and the way to characterise the spatial correlation between
the marks. We demonstrate by means of these statistics that passive galaxies
exhibit stronger spatial correlation than active galaxies at small scales (r
<20 Mpc/h). The mark connection function, introduced here, is particularly
useful for understanding the spatial correlation between the marks.

symmetry of materials. Phase transitions, lattice rotations or electromagnetic
coupling in multiferroic compounds can be revealed by using second harmonic
generation.[1-4] Here we show that the sense of the spontaneous electric
polarization Ps in trigonal ferroelectrics can lead to a pronounced spatial
dependence of the second harmonic generation. By using a two-dimensional
nonlinear photonic structure we demonstrate that counter-propagating beams
along the polar axis generate non-reciprocal second harmonic patterns. In
optics, with some exception,[5] non-reciprocal phenomena are generally related
to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry involving a magnetic field.[6,7]
Here, in contrast, the non-reciprocity is inherent to the quadratic nonlinear
tensor being related to the inversion symmetry breaking at the ferroelectric
phase. These findings provide novel routes to generate nonreciprocal
light-matter interaction processes in two-dimensional structures assembled onto
polar surfaces,[8,9] including metals for plasmonics or biological compounds.

(Mt. Graham, Arizona, US) is presented. The statistic includes measurements
related to 43 nights done with a Generalized Scidar (GS) used in standard
configuration with a vertical resolution Delta(H)~1 km on the whole 20 km and
with the new technique (HVR-GS) in the first kilometer. The latter achieves a
resolution Delta(H)~20-30 m in this region of the atmosphere. Measurements done
in different periods of the year permit us to provide a seasonal variation
analysis of the Cn2. A discretized distribution of Cn2 useful for the Ground
Layer Adaptive Optics (GLAO) simulations is provided and a specific analysis
for the LBT Laser Guide Star system ARGOS (running in GLAO configuration) case
is done including the calculation of the 'gray zones' for J, H and K bands. Mt.
Graham confirms to be an excellent site with median values of the seeing
without dome contribution epsilon = 0.72"", the isoplanatic angle theta0 = 2.5""
and the wavefront coherence time tau0= 4.8 msec. We find that the optical
turbulence vertical distribution decreases in a much sharper way than what has
been believed so far in proximity of the ground above astronomical sites. We
find that 50% of the whole turbulence develops in the first 80+/-15 m from the
ground. We finally prove that the error in the normalization of the
scintillation that has been recently put in evidence in the principle of the GS
technique, affects these measurements with an absolutely negligible quantity
(0.04"").

for photomultipliers array. It allows triggerless acquisition for next
generation neutrino experiments and it belongs to an R&D program funded by the
French national agency for research (ANR) called PMm2: Innovative electronics
for photodetectors array used in High Energy Physics and Astroparticles [2]
(ref.ANR-06-BLAN- 0186). The ASIC integrates 16 independent and auto triggered
channels with variable gain and provides charge and time measurement by a
Wilkinson ADC and a 24-bit Counter. The charge measurement should be performed
from 1 up to 300 photo-electrons (p.e.) with a good linearity. The time
measurement allowed to a coarse time with a 24-bit counter at 10 MHz and a fine
time on a 100ns ramp to achieve a resolution of 1 ns. The ASIC sends out only
the relevant data through network cables to the central data storage. This
paper describes the front-end electronics ASIC called PARISROC.

based on tree matrix elements exist and are used by experimental collaborations
in high energy physics. As the evaluation of one-loop matrix elements has
recently been undergoing enormous progress, the combination of one-loop matrix
elements with existing Monte Carlo tools is on the horizon. This would lead to
phenomenological predictions at the next-to-leading order level. This note
summarises the discussion of the next-to-leading order multi-leg (NLM) working
group on this issue which has been taking place during the workshop on Physics
at TeV colliders at Les Houches, France, in June 2009. The result is a proposal
for a standard interface between Monte Carlo tools and one-loop matrix element
programs.

University-Industry-Government Relations focuses on the overlay of
expectations, communications, and interactions that potentially feed back on
the institutional arrangements among the carrying agencies. From this
perspective, the evolutionary perspective in economics can be complemented with
the reflexive turn from sociology. The combination provides a richer
understanding of how knowledge-based systems of innovation are shaped and
reconstructed. The communicative capacities of the carrying agents become
crucial to the system's further development, whereas the institutional
arrangements (e.g., national systems) can be expected to remain under
reconstruction. The tension of the differentiation no longer needs to be
resolved, since the network configurations are reproduced by means of
translations among historically changing codes. Some methodological and
epistemological implications for studying innovation systems are explicated.
