analyzed for the case of scale free steady state networks. It is found that
contrary to what one would have naively expected, the rewiring process
typically tends to suppress epidemic spreading. In particular it is found that
as in static networks, rewiring networks with degree distribution exponent
$\gamma >3$ exhibit a threshold in the infection rate below which epidemics die
out in the steady state. However the threshold is higher in the rewiring case.
For $2<\gamma \leq 3$ no such threshold exists, but for small infection rate
the steady state density of infected nodes (prevalence) is smaller for rewiring
networks.

answer fundamental scientific questions ranging from cosmology to stellar
physics. The unexpected discovery that the expansion of the universe is
accelerating was based upon the measurement of astrophysical standard candles
that appeared fainter than expected. To characterize the underlying physical
mechanism of the ""Dark Energy"" responsible for this phenomenon requires an
improvement in the visible-NIR flux calibration of astrophysical sources to 1%
precision. These improvements will also enable large surveys of white dwarf
stars, e.g. GAIA, to advance stellar astrophysics by testing and providing
constraints for the mass-radius relationship of these stars.
  ACCESS (Absolute Color Calibration Experiment for Standard Stars) is a
rocket-borne payload that will enable the transfer of absolute laboratory
detector standards from NIST to a network of stellar standards with a
calibration accuracy of 1% and a spectral resolving power of R = 500 across the
0.35-1.7 micron bandpass.
  Among the strategies being employed to minimize calibration uncertainties
are: (1) judicious selection of standard stars (previous calibration heritage,
minimal spectral features, robust stellar atmosphere models), (2) execution of
observations above the Earth's atmosphere (eliminates atmospheric contamination
of the stellar spectrum), (3) a single optical path and detector (to minimize
visible to NIR cross-calibration uncertainties), (4) establishment of an a
priori error budget, (5) on-board monitoring of instrument performance, and (6)
fitting stellar atmosphere models to the data to search for discrepancies and
confirm performance.

of locally-conserved observables. Understanding how microscopic dynamics
determines the averages and fluctuations of these currents is one of the main
open problems in nonequilibrium statistical physics. The additivity principle
is a theoretical proposal that allows to compute the current distribution in
many one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems. Using simulations, we confirm this
conjecture in a simple and general model of energy transport, both in the
presence of a temperature gradient and in canonical equilibrium. In particular,
we show that the current distribution displays a Gaussian regime for small
current fluctuations, as prescribed by the central limit theorem, and
non-Gaussian (exponential) tails for large current deviations, obeying in all
cases the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem. In order to facilitate a given
current fluctuation, the system adopts a well-defined temperature profile
different from that of the steady state, and in accordance with the additivity
hypothesis predictions. System statistics during a large current fluctuation is
independent of the sign of the current, which implies that the optimal profile
(as well as higher-order profiles and spatial correlations) are invariant upon
currenst inversion. We also demonstrate that finite-time joint fluctuations of
the current and the profile are well described by the additivity functional.
These results confirm the additivity hypothesis as a general and powerful tool
to compute current distributions in many nonequilibrium systems.

accumulates point defects and helium therein. We present density functional
theory (DFT) calculations for UO2, PuO2 and MOX containing He atoms in
octahedral interstitial positions. In particular, we calculated basic MOX
properties and He incorporation energies as functions of Pu concentration
within the spin-polarized, generalized gradient approximation (GGA) DFT
calculations. We also included the on-site electron correlation corrections
using the Hubbard model (in the framework of the so-called DFT+U approach). We
found that PuO2 remains semiconducting with He in the octahedral position while
UO2 requires a specific lattice distortion. Both materials reveal a positive
energy for He incorporation, which, therefore, is an exothermic process. The He
incorporation energy increases with the Pu concentration in the MOX fuel.

idea that at the metallicity of the bright PNe analyzed in M33, which is
similar to that found in the LMC, these elements have not been significantly
modified during the dredge-up processes that take place during the AGB phase of
their progenitor stars. We find no significant oxygen abundance offset between
PNe and HII regions at any given galactocentric distance, despite the fact that
these objects represent different age groups in the evolution of the galaxy.

this system supports. The susceptibility peak measured at different constant
heating rates in the range 0.20 K/s < R < 0.70 K/s shifts to higher temperature
as the heating rate is increased. Analysis using a relaxation model
demonstrates quantitatively that the dynamics is driven by a non-equilibrium
domain density at (nearly) zero field (i.e. by dipole interactions), and that
the temperature shift is due to a response time determined by the pinning of
local domain wall segments by structural defects. The fundamental time scale
for relaxation of the domain density driven by dipole interactions is of order
10^5 times slower than the fundamental time scale for an individual Barkhausen
step driven by an applied field. The increase in the fundamental time scale
reflects the relative size of dipole and Zeeman energies, and the need for the
correlated motion of many local domain wall segments to affect domain growth.

orbit with a massive highly eccentric companion orbiting HAT-P-13 offers the
possibility of probing the structure of the short-period planet. The ability to
do this relies on the system being in a quasi-equilibrium state in the sense
that the eccentricities are constant on the usual secular timescale, and decay
on a timescale which is much longer than the age of the system. Since the
equilibrium eccentricity is effectively a function only of observable system
parameters and the unknown Love number of the short-period planet, the latter
can be determined with accurate measurements of the planet's eccentricity and
radius. However, this analysis relies on the unlikely assumption that the
system is coplanar. Here we generalize our recent analysis of this fixed-point
phenomenon to mutually inclined systems and show that the fixed point of
coplanar systems is replaced by a limit cycle, with the average value of the
eccentricity decreasing and its amplitude of variation increasing with
increasing mutual inclination. This behaviour significantly reduces the ability
to unambiguously determine the Love number of the short-period planet if the
mutual inclination is higher than around 10^o. We show that for Q-values less
than 10^6, the HAT-P-13 system cannot have a mutual inclination between 54 and
126^o because Kozai oscillations coupled with tidal dissipation would act to
quickly move the inclination outside this range, and that the behaviour of
retrograde systems is the mirror image of that for prograde systems. We derive
a relationship between the equilibrium radius of the short-period planet, its
Q-value and its core mass, and show that given current estimates of e_b and the
planet radius, the HAT-P-13 system is likely to be close to coplanar [...]

its characteristics provides a wealth of information on the details of possible
evolution processes of dS0 galaxies which may not be possible in other, more
distant objects. In order to study its kinematics and star formation history,
we obtained long slit spectroscopy at the OHP 1m93 telescope along the major
and minor axes of NGC404. The spectra have a resolution R = 3600 covering a
wavelength range from 4600 to 5500 A. The data are fitted against the Pegase.HR
stellar population models to derive simultaneously the internal stellar
kinematics, ages and metallicities. Firstly, the global properties of the
galaxy are analyzed by fitting a single model and to the data and looking at
the kinematic variations and SSP equivalent age and metallicities as a function
of radius. Afterwards, the stellar populations are decomposed into 4 components
that are individually analyzed. NGC404 clearly shows two radial velocity
inversions along its major axis. The kinematically decoupled core rotates in
the same direction as the neutral hydrogen shell that surrounds the galaxy. We
resolved the star formation history in the core of the galaxy ino 4 events: A
very young (< 150 Myr, and [Fe/H] = 0.4) component with constant on-going star
formation, a second young (430 Myr) component with [Fe/H] = 0.1, an
intermediate population (1.7 Gyr) which has [Fe/H] = -0.05 and, finally, an old
(12 Gyr) component with [Fe/H] = -1.26. The two young components fade very
quickly with radius, leaving only the intermediate and old population at a
radius of 25"" (370 pc) from the centre. We conclude that NGC404 had a spiral
morphology about 1 Gyr ago and that one or many merger events has triggered a
morphological transition.

in cluster detection, especially around the mass at which the performance of
the survey begins to decrease. If the CC were removed, a lower overall fraction
of detected clusters would be expected. In order to estimate the presence of
such a bias by means of SZ only surveys, we show that the ratio between y_0 and
y_int anti-correlates with the cluster central cooling time. If multi-band
optical cluster surveys are either available for a cross-match or a follow-up
is planned, we suggest that likely CC clusters are those with a Brightest
Cluster Galaxy (BCG) at least 0.3 magnitudes bluer than the average. A more
robust estimate of the CC presence is given by UV-optical colours of the BCG,
like the NUV-r, whose values can be 4 magnitudes off the NUV-r equivalent of
the red sequence, in clusters with low excess entropy. We also find correlation
of the y_0/y_int ratio with Halpha, IR and radio luminosities. We argue that
the analysis of a combined SZ/optical/UV surveys can be also used to shed light

High-synchrotron peaked BLLacs (HSP-BLLacs). The distribution of photon index
(obtained from a power-law fit above 100 MeV) is found to correlate strongly
with blazar subclass. The change in spectral index from that averaged over the
six month observing period is < 0.2-0.3 when the flux varies by about an order
of magnitude, with a tendency toward harder spectra when the flux is brighter
for FSRQs and LSP-BLLacs. A strong departure from a single power-law spectrum
appears to be a common feature for FSRQs. This feature is also present for some
high-luminosity LSP-BLLacs, and a small number of ISP-BLLacs. It is absent in
all LBAS HSP-BLLacs. For 3C 454.3 and AO 0235+164, the two brightest FSRQ

acceptable of power law, broken power law, and curved forms. The consequences

computation of the configurational entropy based on a lattice model of polymer
melts that includes monomer structural effects. Antiplasticization is
accompanied by a ""toughening"" of the glass mixture relative to the pure
polymer, and this effect is found to occur when the diluents are small species
with strongly attractive interactions with the polymer matrix. Plasticization
leads to a decreased glass transition temperature T_g and a ""softening"" of the
fragile host polymer in the glass state. Plasticization is prompted by small
additives with weakly attractive interactions with the polymer matrix. The
shifts in T_g of polystyrene diluted by fully flexible short oligomers are
evaluated from the computations, along with the relative changes in the
isothermal compressibility at T_g to characterize the extent to which the
additives act as antiplasticizers or plasticizers. The theory predicts that a
decreased fragility can accompany both antiplasticization and plasticization of
the glass by molecular additives. The general reduction in the T_g and
fragility of polymers by these molecular additives is rationalized by analyzing
the influence of the diluent's properties (cohesive energy, chain length, and
stiffness) on glass formation in diluted polymer melts. The description of
glass formation at fixed temperature that is induced upon change the fluid

Therefore, the vorticity field is an effective tool to reveal the nonlinear
behavior of the IGM, especially the formation and evolution of turbulence in
the IGM. We find that the vorticity field does not follow the filaments and
sheets structures of underlying dark matter density field and shows highly non-
Gaussian and intermittent features. The power spectrum of the vorticity field
is used to measure the development of turbulence in Fourier space. We show that
the relation between the power spectra of vorticity and velocity fields is
perfectly in agreement with the prediction of a fully developed homogeneous and
isotropic turbulence from 0.2 to 3 h^{-1} Mpc at z~0. This indicates that
cosmic baryonic field is in the state of fully developed turbulence on scales
less than about 3 h^{-1} Mpc. The random field of the turbulent fluid yields
turbulent pressure to prevent the gravitational collapsing of the IGM. The
vorticity and turbulent pressure are strong inside and even outside of high
density regions. In IGM regions with 10 times mean overdensity, the turbulent
pressure can be on an average equivalent to the thermal pressure of the
baryonic gas with a temperature of 10^5 K. The fully developed turbulence would
prevent the baryons in the IGM from falling into the gravitational well of dark
matter halos. Moreover, turbulent pressure is dynamical and non-thermal, which
makes it different from pre-heating mechanism as it does not affect the thermal
state and ionizing process of hydrogen in the IGM.

change of an external parameter like the temperature or the pressure. If the
perturbation is small enough, the system does not become unstable but rather
stays metastable. In diffusive transformations, the system then evolves through
the nucleation, the growth and the coarsening of a second phase. Such a phase
transformation is found in a lot of situations in materials science like
condensation of liquid droplets from a supersaturated vapor, solidification,

convection zones. Different driving sources are studied, including cooling at
the top of the convectively unstable region, as occurs in surface convection
zones; and heating at the base by nuclear burning. The transport of enthalpy
and kinetic energy, and the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy
dissipation are studied. We emphasize the importance of global constraints on
shaping the quasi-steady flow characteristics, and present an analysis of
turbulent convection which is posed as a boundary value problem that can be
easily incorporated into standard stellar evolution codes for deep, efficient
convection. Direct comparison is made between the theoretical analysis and the
simulated flow and very good agreement is found. Some common assumptions
traditionally used to treat quasi-steady turbulent flow in stellar models are
briefly discussed. The importance and proper treatment of convective boundaries
are indicated.

bank is used to extract facial features that characterized by spatial
frequency, spatial locality and orientation. Gabor face representation captures
substantial amount of variations of the face instances that often occurs due to
illumination, pose and facial expression changes. Convolution of Gabor filter
bank to face images of rotated profile views produce Gabor faces with high
dimensional features vectors. Canonical covariate is then used to Gabor faces
to reduce the high dimensional feature spaces into low dimensional subspaces.
Finally, support vector machines are trained with canonical sub-spaces that
contain reduced set of features and perform recognition task. The proposed
system is evaluated with UMIST face database. The experiment results
demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed system with high

""clouds"" of closely spaced similar Gaussians. In this paper we describe the new

with the single-link hierarchical clustering procedure in five-dimensional

modifications to accommodate it to the large number of components. We also use
the requirement that each cloud may be represented at any observed sky position
by only one Gaussian and take into account the similarity of global properties
of the merging clouds. As a test, we apply the algorithm for finding the clouds
of the narrowest HI 21-cm line components. Using the full sky search for cold
clouds, we easily detect the coldest known HI clouds and demonstrate that
actually they are a part of a long narrow ribbon of cold clouds. We model these
clouds as a part of a planar gas ring, deduce their spatial placement, and
discuss their relation to supernova shells in the solar neighborhood. We
conclude that the proposed algorithm satisfactorily solves the posed task. We
