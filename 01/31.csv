shows that the probability of the line being a statistical fluctuation is p <

taken at different epochs yields a probability p< 3 x 10^-11 and thus
conclusively demonstrates that it cannot be a statistical fluctuation in the

material are prominent when the source flux is low, during 2005. Spectra from
2008 show evidence for a line consistent with having the same flux and energy
as that observed during 2005, but inconsistent with having a constant
equivalent width against the observed continuum. The stability of the line flux
and energy suggests that it may not arise in transient hotspots, as has been
suggested for similar lines in other sources, but could arise from a special
location in the reprocessor, such as the inner edge of the accretion disk.
Alternatively, the line energy may be explained by spallation of Fe into Cr, as
discussed in a companion paper.

emerges at the correlated insulator threshold of ultra-thin, amorphous,

conductance G >> e^2/h, the anomalous Hall resistance of the films increases
with increasing disorder and the Hall conductance scales as Gxy ~ G^1.6.
However, at sufficiently high disorder the system begins to enter the 2D
correlated insulator regime, at which point the Hall resistance Rxy abruptly
saturates and the scaling exponent becomes 2. Tunneling measurements show that
the saturation behavior is commensurate with the emergence of the 2D Coulomb
gap, suggesting that e-e interactions mediate the high-disorder phase.

  Scotland, 26-29 July, 2010",,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this book we introduce a new procedure called \alpha-Discounting Method
for Multi-Criteria Decision Making (\alpha-D MCDM), which is as an alternative
and extension of Saaty Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). It works for any
number of preferences that can be transformed into a system of homogeneous
linear equations. A degree of consistency (and implicitly a degree of
inconsistency) of a decision-making problem are defined. \alpha-D MCDM is
afterwards generalized to a set of preferences that can be transformed into a
system of linear and or non-linear homogeneous and or non-homogeneous equations
and or inequalities. The general idea of \alpha-D MCDM is to assign non-null
positive parameters \alpha_1, \alpha_2, and so on \alpha_p to the coefficients
in the right-hand side of each preference that diminish or increase them in
order to transform the above linear homogeneous system of equations which has
only the null-solution, into a system having a particular non-null solution.
After finding the general solution of this system, the principles used to
assign particular values to all parameters \alpha is the second important part
of \alpha-D, yet to be deeper investigated in the future. In the current book
we propose the Fairness Principle, i.e. each coefficient should be discounted
with the same percentage (we think this is fair: not making any favoritism or
unfairness to any coefficient), but the reader can propose other principles.
For consistent decision-making problems with pairwise comparisons,
\alpha-Discounting Method together with the Fairness Principle give the same
result as AHP. But for weak inconsistent decision-making problem,
\alpha-Discounting together with the Fairness Principle give a different result
from AHP. Many consistent, weak inconsistent, and strong inconsistent examples
are given in this book.

large. This occurs at many conventional fixed points of NLSMs which are
perturbatively accessible within the usual epsilon-expansion in d=2+\epsilon
dimensions. Since such operators are not prohibited from occurring in the
action, they appear to threaten the very existence of such fixed points. At the
same time, for NLSMs describing metal-insulator transitions of Anderson
localization in electronic conductors, the strong RG-relevance of these
operators has been previously related to statistical properties of the
conductance of samples of large finite size (""conductance fluctuations""). In
this paper, we analyze this question, not for perturbative RG treatments of
NLSMs, but for 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models at level k, perturbatively in
the current-current interaction of the Noether current. WZW models are special
(""Principal Chiral"") NLSMs on a Lie Group G with a WZW term at level k. In
these models the role of high-gradient operators is played by homogeneous
polynomials of order 2s in the Noether currents, whose scaling dimensions we
analyze. For the Lie Supergroup G=GL(2N|2N) and k=1, this corresponds to
time-reversal invariant problems of Anderson localization in the so-called
chiral symmetry classes, and the strength of the current-current interaction, a
measure of the strength of disorder, is known to be completely marginal (for
any k). We find that all high-gradient (polynomial) operators are, to one loop
order, irrelevant or relevant depending on the sign of that interaction.

the bi-directional relay channel with two terminal nodes (or end users) and one
relay. In this work we consider bi-directional relaying with one base station,
multiple terminal nodes and one relay, all of which operate in half-duplex
modes. We assume that each terminal node communicates with the base-station in
a bi-directional fashion through the relay and do not place any restrictions on
the channels between the users, relays and base-stations; that is, each node
has a direct link with every other node.
  Our contributions are three-fold: 1) the introduction of four new temporal
protocols which fully exploit the two-way nature of the data and outperform
simple routing or multi-hop communication schemes by carefully combining
network coding, random binning and user cooperation which exploit over-heard
and own-message side information, 2) derivations of inner and outer bounds on
the capacity region of the discrete-memoryless multi-pair two-way network, and
3) a numerical evaluation of the obtained achievable rate regions and outer
bounds in Gaussian noise which illustrate the performance of the proposed
protocols compared to simpler schemes, to each other, to the outer bounds,
which highlight the relative gains achieved by network coding, random binning
and compress-and-forward-type cooperation between terminal nodes.

number of synchronous communication rounds. We present local approximation
algorithms for the minimum dominating set problem and the maximum matching
problem in 2-coloured and weakly 2-coloured graphs. In a weakly 2-coloured
graph, both problems admit a local algorithm with the approximation factor
$(\Delta+1)/2$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. We also give
a matching lower bound proving that there is no local algorithm with a better
approximation factor for either of these problems. Furthermore, we show that
the stronger assumption of a 2-colouring does not help in the case of the
dominating set problem, but there is a local approximation scheme for the
maximum matching problem in 2-coloured graphs.

arbitrary photonic two-mode input states onto the subspace spanned by the

provide the possibility to conditionally generate highly entangled photon
number states as resource for quantum information protocols but also allows one
to test and hence purify this type of quantum states in a communication
scenario, which is of great practical importance. The scheme is especially
attractive as a generalization to many modes allows for distribution and
purification of entanglement in networks. In an alternative working mode, the
setup allows of quantum non demolition number resolved photodetection in the
optical domain.

  Ruggiero, M.L., Kluwer, 2004",,,"physics.class-ph physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The peculiarities of rotating frames of reference played an important role in
the genesis of general relativity. Considering them, Einstein became convinced
that coordinates have a different status in the general theory of relativity
than in the special theory. This line of thinking was confused, however. To
clarify the situation we investigate the relation between coordinates and the
results of space-time measurements in rotating reference frames. We argue that
the difference between rotating systems (or accelerating systems in general)
and inertial systems does not lie in a different status of the coordinates
(which are conventional in all cases), but rather in different global
chronogeometric properties of the various reference frames. In the course of
our discussion we comment on a number of related issues, such as the question
of whether a consideration of the behavior of rods and clocks is indispensable
for the foundation of kinematics, the influence of acceleration on the behavior
of measuring devices, the conventionality of simultaneity, and the Ehrenfest
paradox.

for the approximation of magnetic fields. We also provide explicit formulae of

  The analysis of the impact of the design decisions focuses on the different

specialised algorithms for specific types of variables. It also briefly
considers other, less significant decisions.
