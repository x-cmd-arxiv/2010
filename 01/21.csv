that top quark pair production is dominated at low invariant mass by the fusion

production is dominated by the fusion of unlike-helicity gluons, producing top
quark pairs in the up-down or down-up off-diagonal configurations, identical to
top quark pair production via quark-antiquark annihilation. We study in detail
the low invariant mass region, and show that the spin correlations can be
easily observed in this region by looking at the distribution of the difference

dark energy cosmologies. This widely used approximation assumes that the mass
function can be expressed as a function of the matter density omega_m and the
rms linear density fluctuation sigma only, with no explicit dependence on the
properties of dark energy or redshift. In order to test this hypothesis we run
a series of 15 high-resolution N-body simulations for different cosmological
models. These consists of three LCDM cosmologies best fitting WMAP-1, 3 and 5
years data, and three toy-models characterized by a Ratra-Peebles quintessence
potential with different slopes and amounts of dark energy density. These toy
models have very different evolutionary histories at the background and linear
level, but share the same sigma8 value. For each of these models we measure the
mass function from catalogues of halos identified in the simulations using the
Friend-of-Friend (FoF) algorithm. We find redshift dependent deviations from a
universal behaviour, well above numerical uncertainties and of non-stochastic
origin, which are correlated with the linear growth factor of the investigated
cosmologies. Using the spherical collapse as guidance, we show that such
deviations are caused by the cosmology dependence of the non-linear collapse
and virialization process. For practical applications, we provide a fitting
formula of the mass function accurate to 5 percents over the all range of
investigated cosmologies. We also derive an empirical relation between the FoF
linking parameter and the virial overdensity which can account for most of the
deviations from an exact universal behavior. Overall these results suggest that
the halo mass function contains unique cosmological information since it
carries a fossil record of the past cosmic evolution.

crystal structure for the stoichiometric case of x=2, where the valence of each

Hund's coupling among d orbitals within the same V atoms and antiferromagnetic
coupling between d oribitals and LUMO of TCNE (bridging V atoms) due to

This view based on localized electrons is supplemented by the band picture,
which indicates the existence of a flat band expected to lead to ferromagnetism
as well consistent with the localized view. The off-stoichiometric cases (x<2),
which still show ferromagnetism but semiconducting transport properties, have
been analyzed as due to Anderson localization.

arise from different phases in the interstellar medium (ISM), and the
mass-loading factor in the MVV model is a function of galaxy stellar mass. We
find that the simulation with the MVV outflow has the following
characteristics: (i) the intergalactic medium (IGM) is hardly heated up, and
the mean IGM temperature is almost the same as in the no-wind run; (ii) it has
lower cosmic star formation rates (SFRs) compared to the no-wind run, but
higher SFRs than the constant velocity wind run; (iii) it roughly agrees with
the observed IGM metallicity, and roughly follows the observed evolution of
Omega(Civ); (iv) the lower mass galaxies have larger mass-loading factors, and
the low-mass end of galaxy stellar mass function is flatter than in the
previous simulations. Therefore, the MVV outflow model mildly alleviates the
problem of too steep galaxy stellar mass function seen in the previous SPH
simulations. In summary, the new MVV outflow model shows reasonable agreement
with observations,

Adler function and the five-loop beta-function in quenched QED. In particular,
the appearance of an irrational contribution proportional to zeta_3 in the

chemistry by efficiently removing Fe-bearing species from the gas phase.
Monatomic Fe is the most abundant Fe-bearing gas throughout the atmospheres of

Mg- and Si-bearing gases are effectively removed from the atmosphere by
forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and enstatite (MgSiO3) cloud formation. Monatomic Mg is

randomly removing data segments from stationary signals with different types of

exponent $\alpha$ of the original correlated signal, (ii) the percentage $p$ of
the data removed, (iii) the average length $\mu$ of the removed (or remaining)

scaling exponent of positively correlated signals remains practically unchanged
even for extreme data loss of up to 90%. In contrast, the global scaling of
anti-correlated signals changes to uncorrelated behavior even when a very small
fraction of the data is lost. These observations are confirmed on the examples
of human gait and commodity price fluctuations. We systematically study the
{\it local} scaling behavior of signals with missing data to reveal deviations
across scales. We find that for anti-correlated signals even 10% of data loss
leads to deviations in the local scaling at large scales from the original
anti-correlated towards uncorrelated behavior. In contrast, positively
correlated signals show no observable changes in the local scaling for up to
65% of data loss, while for larger percentage, the local scaling shows
overestimated regions (with higher local exponent) at small scales, followed by
underestimated regions (with lower local exponent) at large scales. Finally, we

to singularities at zero temperature, even when the spatial volume is finite.
These singularities are smoothed out at a finite temperature but leave behind
non-trivial finite size effects which must be understood in order to extract
thermodynamic quantities using Monte Carlo methods, particularly close to
critical points. We illustrate some of these issues using the classical
non-linear O(2) sigma model with a coupling $\beta$ and chemical potential
$\mu$ on a 2+1 dimensional Euclidean lattice. In the conventional formulation
this model suffers from a sign problem at non-zero chemical potential and hence
cannot be studied with the Wolff cluster algorithm. However, when formulated in
terms of world-line of particles, the sign problem is absent and the model can
be studied efficiently with the ""worm algorithm"". Using this method we study
the finite size effects that arise due to the chemical potential and develop an

that describes gravity is not the full group of diffeomorphisms Diff(M), as in
General Relativity, but a maximal subgroup of it, TransverseDiff(M), with its
elements having a jacobian equal to unity; at the infinitesimal level, the
parameter describing the coordinate change, xi^mu (x), is transverse, i.e.,
partial_mu(xi^mu)=0. Incidentally, this is the smaller symmetry one needs to
propagate consistently a graviton, which is a great theoretical motivation for
considering these theories. Also, the determinant of the metric, g, behaves as
a ""transverse scalar"", so that these theories can be seen as a generalization
of the better-known unimodular gravity. We present our results on the
observational constraints on transverse gravity, in close relation with the
claim of equivalence with general scalar-tensor theory. We also comment on the
structure of the divergences of the quantum theory to the one-loop order.

motivations for supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model, we recall that
supersymmetric relics from the Big Bang are expected in models that conserve R
parity. We then discuss possible supersymmetric dark matter candidates,
focusing on the lightest neutralino and the gravitino. In the latter case, the
next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle is expected to be long-lived, and
possible candidates include spartners of the tau lepton, top quark and
neutrino. We then discuss the roles of the renormalization-group equations and
electroweak symmetry breaking in delimiting the supersymmetric parameter space.
We discuss in particular the constrained minimal extension of the Standard
Model (CMSSM), in which the supersymmetry-breaking parameters are assumed to be
universal at the grand unification scale, presenting predictions from a
frequentist analysis of its parameter space. We also discuss astrophysical and
cosmological constraints on gravitino dark matter models, as well as the
parameter space of minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) models in which there are
extra relations between the trilinear and bilinear supersymmetry-breaking
parameters, and between the gravitino and scalar masses. Finally, we discuss
models with non-universal supersymmetry-breaking contributions to Higgs masses,
and models in which the supersymmetry-breaking parameters are universal at some
scale below that of grand unification.

young sigma Orionis open cluster, which is a benchmark for star-forming
studies. Because of the very low proper motion of the cluster, late-type dwarfs
with appreciable proper motion in the foreground of sigma Orionis can be easily
discarded for expensive spectroscopic follow-up. Methods: I use the Aladin sky
atlas, USNO-B1, public astrometric catalogues, and photographic plate
digitisations to identify stars with proper motions inconsistent with cluster
membership in a circular area of radius 30 arcmin centred on the early-type
multiple system sigma Ori. Mostly due to the long time baseline, of more than
half a century, the errors in the measured proper motions are lower than 2
mas/a. Results: Of the 42 stars selected for astrometric follow-up, 37 of them
are proper-motion cluster interlopers. Some USNO-B1 measurements were affected
by partially resolved (visual) multiplicity and target faintness. Because of
their late spectral types and, hence, red colours, 24 contaminants had been
considered as sigma Orionis members at some moment. I discuss how contamination
may have affected previous works (especially related to disc frequencies) and
the curious presence of lithium absorption in three M-dwarf proper-motion
contaminants. Finally, I classify the bright star HD 294297 as a late-F field
dwarf unrelated to the cluster based on a new proper motion measurement.
Conclusions: Although proper motions cannot be used to confirm membership in
sigma Orionis, they can be used instead to discard a number of cluster member
candidates without spectroscopy.

conditions that cannot be reconciled with the warm and very dense molecular gas

that an optically thick dust continuum, with tau(f>350 GHz)>=1 for the bulk of
the warm dust and gas in Arp 220, submerges this line to an almost black body

broad family of block positivity tests and prove that they can never be
sufficient, which should be useful in case of future efforts in that direction.
Finally, we introduce the concept of length of a separable state and present
new results concerning relationships between the length and Schmidt rank. In

Schmidt ranks equal to their lengths. We also give an example of a state which

determined from the HR diagram and ages determined from lithium depletion (Song

pre-main-sequence evolutionary models. To further test these models, we present
high resolution spectra for members of the Beta Pictoris Moving Group (BPMG),
which is young and nearby. We measure equivalent widths of the 6707.8 Angstrom
Li I line in these stars and use them to determine lithium abundances. We
combine the lithium abundance with the predictions of pre-main-sequence
evolutionary models in order to calculate a lithium depletion age for each
star. We compare this age to the age predicted by the HR diagram of the same
model. We find that the evolutionary models under-predict the amount of lithium
depletion for the BPMG given its nominal HR diagram age of ~12 Myr (Zuckerman
et al. 2001), particularly for the mid-M stars, which have no observable Li I
line. This results in systematically older ages calculated from lithium
depletion isochrones than from the HR diagram. We suggest that this discrepancy
may be related to the discrepancy between measured M-dwarf radii and the
smaller radii predicted by evolutionary models.

use of multiple surveys, to place constraints on the input assumptions, and
reduce uncertainties in the star formation rate estimate. Ultimately, this will

background (DSNB), which is on the verge of detectability. The observed flux
depends on supernova physics, but also on the cosmic history of supernova
explosions; currently, the cosmic supernova rate introduces a substantial
(+/-40%) uncertainty, largely through its absolute normalization. However, a
new class of wide-field, repeated-scan (synoptic) optical sky surveys is coming
online, and will map the sky in the time domain with unprecedented depth,
completeness, and dynamic range. We show that these surveys will obtain the
cosmic supernova rate by direct counting, in an unbiased way and with high
statistics, and thus will allow for precise predictions of the DSNB. Upcoming
sky surveys will substantially reduce the uncertainties in the DSNB source
history to an anticipated +/-5% that is dominated by systematics, so that the
observed high-energy flux thus will test supernova neutrino physics. The
portion of the universe (z < 1) accessible to upcoming sky surveys includes the
progenitors of a large fraction (~ 87%) of the expected 10-26 MeV DSNB event
rate. We show that precision determination of the (optically detected) cosmic
supernova history will also make the DSNB into a strong probe of an extra flux
of neutrinos from optically invisible supernovae, which may be unseen either
due to unexpected large dust obscuration in host galaxies, or because some
core-collapse events proceed directly to black hole formation and fail to give

vehicle-to-vehicle collaboration. Due to the highly dynamic nature of the
underlying vehicular network topology, we depart from architectures requiring
centralized coordination, reliable MAC scheduling, or global network state
knowledge, and instead adopt a distributed paradigm with simple protocols. In
other words, we investigate the problem of reliable dissemination from multiple
sources when each node in the network shares a limited amount of its resources
for cooperating with others. By using \emph{rateless} coding at the Road Side
Unit (RSU) and using vehicles as data carriers, we describe an efficient way to
achieve reliable dissemination to all nodes (even disconnected clusters in the
network). In the nutshell, we explore vehicles as mobile storage devices. We
then develop a method to keep the density of the rateless codes packets as a
function of distance from the RSU at the desired level set for the target
decoding distance. We investigate various tradeoffs involving buffer size,
maximum capacity, and the mobility parameter of the vehicles.

submillimeter galaxy SXDF850.6. SXDF850.6 is a bright source (S(850 micron) = 8
mJy) detected in the SCUBA Half Degree Extragalactic Survey (SHADES), and has
multiple possible radio counterparts in its deep radio image obtained at the
VLA. Our new SMA detection finds that the submm emission coincides with the
brightest radio emission that is found ~8"" north of the coordinates determined
from SCUBA. Despite the lack of detectable counterparts in deep UV/optical
images, we find a source at the SMA position in near-infrared and longer
wavelength images. We perform SED model fits to UV-optical-IR photometry (u, B,
V, R, i', z', J, H, K, 3.6 micron, 4.5 micron, 5.8 micron, and 8.0 micron) and
to submm-radio photometry (850 micron, 880 micron, 1100 micron, and 21 cm)

redshift of z ~= 2.2 (+/- 0.3). The best-fit parameters from the UV-optical-IR
SED fit are a redshift of z = 1.87 (+0.15/-0.07), a stellar mass of M_star =
2.5 +2.2/-0.3 x 10^11 M_sun, an extinction of A_V = 3.0 (+0.3/-1.0) mag, and an
age of 720 (+1880/-210) Myr. The submm-radio SED fit provides a consistent
redshift of z ~ 1.8-2.5, an IR luminosity of L_IR = (7-26) x 10^12 L_sun, and a
star formation rate of 1300-4500 M_sun/yr. These results suggest that SXDF850.6
is a mature system already having a massive amount of old stellar population
constructed before its submm bright phase and is experiencing a dusty
starburst, possibly induced by major mergers.

the most extended (A) configuration of the IRAM PdBI at 1.3 mm, which allow us
to probe the multiplicity of Class 0 protostars down to separations a ~50 AU

revealed only wide (>1500 AU) protobinary systems and/or outflow-generated
features. When combined with previous millimeter interferometric observations
of Class 0 protostars, our pilot PdBI study tentatively suggests that the
binary fraction in the ~ 75-1000 AU range increases from the Class 0 to the
Class I stage. It also seems to argue against purely hydrodynamic models of

reconcile the low multiplicity rate of Class 0 protostars on small scales with

collisions during a first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT) possible

The theory extends earlier work and is formulated to assess the importance of
surface dynamics in such collisions. We are led to linearized equations of
motion with O(3) symmetry appropriate for examining collisions in which the
Higgs field is relatively unperturbed from its mean value in the collision
volume. Coherent evolution of the charged $W$ fields within the bubbles is the
main source of the electromagnetic current for generating the seed fields, with
fermions also contributing through the conductivity terms. We present numerical
simulations within this formulation to quantify the role of the surface of the
colliding bubbles, particularly the thickness of the surface, and to show how
conclusions drawn from earlier work are modified. The main sensitivity arises
such that the steeper the bubble surface the more enhanced the seed fields
become. Consequently, the magnetic seed fields may be several times larger and
smoother over the collision volume than found in earlier studies. Our work thus
provides additional support to the supposition that magnetic fields produced
during the EWPT in the early universe seed the galactic and extra-galactic
magnetic fields observed today.

with the wireless propagation effects, the secrecy rate threshold of each link,
and the noise powers of legitimate nodes and eavesdroppers. Sectorized

for improving the secure connectivity. Lastly, the maximum secrecy rate between

the configurational degrees of freedom of a glass-forming material are driven
out of equilibrium with the heat bath by irreversible thermal contraction and
expansion. We assume that the slowly varying configurational subsystem, i.e.
the part of the system that is described by inherent structures, is
characterized by an effective temperature, and contains a volume-related
internal variable. We examine mechanisms by which irreversible dynamics of the
fast, kinetic-vibrational degrees of freedom can cause the entropy and the
effective temperature of the configurational subsystem to increase during
sufficiently rapid changes in the bath temperature. We then use this theory to
interpret the numerical simulations by Mossa and Sciortino (MS), who observe
the Kovacs effect in more detail than is feasible in laboratory experiments.
Our analysis highlights two mechanisms for the equilibration of internal
variables. In one of these, an internal variable first relaxes toward a state
of quasi-equilibrium determined by the effective temperature, and then
approaches true thermodynamic equilibrium as the effective temperature slowly
relaxes toward the bath temperature. In the other mechanism, an internal
variable directly equilibrates with the bath temperature on intermediate
timescales, without equilibrating with the effective temperature at any stage.
Both mechanisms appear to be essential for understanding the MS results.

functionalities such as polarization control and near-field amplification. In
this paper, we introduce a remarkable property of grating mirrors that cannot
be realized by their DBR counterpart: we show that a non-periodic patterning of
the grating surface can give full control over the phase front of reflected
light while maintaining a high reflectivity. This new feature of dielectric
gratings could have a substantial impact on a number of applications that
depend on low-cost, compact optical components, from laser cavities to CD/DVD
read/write heads.

Numerical evaluation in illustrative example networks and comparison with cheap

the design of the protocols is the use of coding in interference networks that
are created in different states or modes of a half-duplex network. Our results
suggest that multistage half-duplex relaying with practical constraints on

networks, if there are multiple non-overlapping paths from source to

  for Storing Data into Flash Memory","37 pages",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Flash memory is widely used as the secondary storage in lightweight computing
devices due to its outstanding advantages over magnetic disks. Flash memory has
many access characteristics different from those of magnetic disks, and how to
take advantage of them is becoming an important research issue. There are two
existing approaches to storing data into flash memory: page-based and
log-based. The former has good performance for read operations, but poor
performance for write operations. In contrast, the latter has good performance
for write operations when updates are light, but poor performance for read
operations. In this paper, we propose a new method of storing data, called
page-differential logging, for flash-based storage systems that solves the
drawbacks of the two methods. The primary characteristics of our method are:
(1) writing only the difference (which we define as the page-differential)
between the original page in flash memory and the up-to-date page in memory;
(2) computing and writing the page-differential only once at the time the page
needs to be reflected into flash memory. The former contrasts with existing
page-based methods that write the whole page including both changed and
unchanged parts of data or from log-based ones that keep track of the history
of all the changes in a page. Our method allows existing disk-based DBMSs to be
reused as flash-based DBMSs just by modifying the flash memory driver, i.e., it
is DBMS-independent. Experimental results show that the proposed method
improves the I/O performance by 1.2 ~ 6.1 times over existing methods for the
TPC-C data of approximately 1 Gbytes.

$n$ of balls and $B$ is empty. At each step, with equal probability, either we
pick a ball at random in $A$ and place it in $B$, or vice-versa (provided of
course that $A$, or $B$, is not empty). The number of balls in $B$ after $n$
steps is of order $\sqrt n$, and this number remains essentially the same after
$\sqrt n$ further steps. Observe that each ball in the urn $B$ after $n$ steps
has a probability bounded away from $0$ and $1$ to be placed back in the urn
$A$ after $\sqrt n$ further steps. So, even though the number of balls in $B$
does not evolve significantly between $n$ and $n+\sqrt n$, the precise contain
of urn $B$ does. This elementary observation is the source of an interesting
two-time-scale phenomenon which we illustrate using a simple model of
fragmentation-coagulation. Inspired by Pitman's construction of coalescing
random forests, we consider for every $n\in \N$ a uniform random tree with $n$
vertices, and at each step, depending on the outcome of an independent fair
coin tossing, either we remove one edge chosen uniformly at random amongst the
remaining edges, or we replace one edge chosen uniformly at random amongst the
edges which have been removed previously. The process that records the sizes of
the tree-components evolves by fragmentation and coagulation. It exhibits
subaging in the sense that when it is observed after $k$ steps in the regime
$k\sim tn+s\sqrt n$ with $t>0$ fixed, it seems to reach a statistical
equilibrium as $n\to\infty$; but different values of $t$ yield distinct
pseudo-stationary distributions.

observations appropriately, a mechanism of preheating just after the end of
inflation is investigated. By using the canonically normalized and diagonalized
scalars, the decay rates of these fields are calculated inflaton $S$ into gauge
sector fields. The reheating temperature is estimated by both the stability
condition of Boltzmann equation and the instant preheating mechanism. The both
of reheating temperatures are almost the same order of magnitude $\sim
O(10^{10})$ GeV. Because two mechanisms are completely independent processes,
the former is caused through the inflaton decays into gauge fields and
gauginons and the latter is caused by the scattering process of two inflatons
into two right handed sneutrinos, which will decay into Higgs fields and other
minimal SUSY standard model (MSSM) particles, we conclude that both mechanisms
play essential roles in the preheating process after inflation.

response by the computer to external stimuli. Real time applications have to
function correctly even in presence of faults. Fault tolerance can be achieved
by either hardware or software or time redundancy. Safety-critical applications
have strict time and cost constraints, which means that not only faults have to
be tolerated but also the constraints should be satisfied. Deadline scheduling
means that the taskwith the earliest required response time is processed. The
most common scheduling algorithms are :Rate Monotonic(RM) and Earliest deadline

The
archaeological record starts to show the arrival of Greek material culture. By
the fifth century BC the island is effectively 'Hellenised' and ancient
historians record the political and military action of poleis, Greek
city-states. Each polis has traditionally been seen as the offshoot of a city
elsewhere. Genealogies of cities ultimately end in cities found in the cities
of the Peloponnese and the Aegean. The 'Greek' identity of the Sicilian cities
is part of a wider debate on the concept of Identity in the ancient world. This
paper considers if there is a contribution archaeoastronomers can make to such
discussions by considering the alignments of Greek temples. Greek religion was
intimately related to notions of civic identity and what it meant to be
'Greek'. I propose a method of studying small samples of temples, which
combines both alignment analysis and historical context. Therefore it may be
possible that a study of the temples may yield useful information about
collective identities. However, as this method shows, the more ambiguous the
cultural data the less certain any astronomical patterns may be.

greater accuracy than the centroid algorithm, at the expense of a slight

strategies for facilitating data collection in circular wireless sensor
networks, which rely on the stochastic diversity of data storage. The goal is
to allow for a reduced delay collection by a data collector who accesses the
network at a random position and random time. Data dissemination is performed
by a set of relays which form a circular route to exchange source packets. The
storage nodes within the transmission range of the route's relays linearly
combine and store overheard relay transmissions using random decentralized
strategies. An intelligent data collector first collects a minimum set of coded
packets from a subset of storage nodes in its proximity, which might be
sufficient for recovering the original packets and, by using a message-passing
decoder, attempts recovering all original source packets from this set.
Whenever the decoder stalls, the source packet which restarts decoding is
polled/doped from its original source node. The random-walk-based analysis of
the decoding/doping process furnishes the collection delay analysis with a
prediction on the number of required doped packets. The number of doped packets
can be surprisingly small when employed with an Ideal Soliton code degree
distribution and, hence, the doping strategy may have the least collection
delay when the density of source nodes is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that network coding makes dissemination more efficient at the
expense of a larger collection delay. Not surprisingly, a circular network
allows for a significantly more (analytically and otherwise) tractable
strategies relative to a network whose model is a random geometric graph.

virtually arranged on a spatial lattice. This produces a large number of
different strategic situations from which we can assess strategy updating. Most

to lower temperatures when the liquid is confined into mesoporous host
matrices. Two contrary explanations for this effect are given in literature:
First, confinement induced acceleration of the dynamics of the molecules leads
to an effective downshift of T-g increasing with decreasing pore size. Second,
due to thermal mismatch between the liquid and the surrounding host matrix,
negative pressure develops inside the pores with decreasing temperature, which
also shifts T-g to lower temperatures. Here we present dynamic mechanical
analysis measurements of the glass forming liquid salol in Vycor and Gelsil
with pore sizes of d=2.6, 5.0 and 7.5 nm. The dynamic complex elastic
susceptibility data can be consistently described with the assumption of two
relaxation processes inside the pores: A surface induced slowed down relaxation
due to interaction with rough pore interfaces and a second relaxation within
the core of the pores. This core relaxation time is reduced with decreasing
pore size d, leading to a downshift of T-g proportional to 1/d in perfect
agreement with recent differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements.
Thermal expansion measurements of empty and salol filled mesoporous samples
revealed that the contribution of negative pressure to the downshift of T-g is
small (<30%) and the main effect is due to the suppression of dynamically
correlated regions of size xi when the pore size xi approaches.

such drawback is transmission of incessant data packets over high speed

minimize the packet loss caused due to congestion. This approach results in
haggle congestion and less packet loss in the designed network.

increasingly sophisticated in their treatment of potential systematic effects.
Here we present cosmological constraints which include modelling of intrinsic
alignments. We demonstrate how the results are changed for three different
intrinsic alignment models, and for two different models of the cosmic shear
galaxy population. We find that intrinsic alignments can either reduce or
increase measurements of the fluctuation amplitude parameter sigma_8 depending
on these decisions, and depending on the cosmic shear survey properties. This
is due to the interplay between the two types of intrinsic alignment, II and
GI. It has been shown that future surveys must make a careful treatment of
intrinsic alignments to avoid significant biases, and that simultaneous
constraints from shear-shear and shear-position correlation functions can
mitigate the effects. For the first time we here combine constraints from
cosmic shear surveys (shear-shear correlations) with those from ""GI"" intrinsic
alignment data sets (shear-position correlations). We produce updated
constraints on cosmology marginalised over two free parameters in the halo
model for intrinsic alignments. We find that the additional freedom is well
compensated by the additional information, in that the constraints are very
similar indeed to those obtained when intrinsic alignments are ignored, both in
terms of best fit values and uncertainties.

large system analysis of vector precoding for the Gaussian multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel. The transmitter is assumed to
comprise a linear front-end combined with nonlinear precoding, that minimizes
the front-end imposed transmit energy penalty. Focusing on discrete complex
input alphabets, the energy penalty is minimized by relaxing the input alphabet
to a larger alphabet set prior to precoding. For the common discrete
lattice-based relaxation, the problem is found to violate the assumption of
replica symmetry and a replica symmetry breaking ansatz is taken. The limiting
empirical distribution of the precoder's output, as well as the limiting energy
penalty, are derived for one-step replica symmetry breaking. For convex
relaxations, replica symmetry is found to hold and corresponding results are
obtained for comparison. Particularizing to a ""zero-forcing"" (ZF) linear
front-end, and non-cooperative users, a decoupling result is derived according
to which the channel observed by each of the individual receivers can be
effectively characterized by the Markov chain u-x-y, where u, x, and y are the
channel input, the equivalent precoder output, and the channel output,
respectively. For discrete lattice-based alphabet relaxation, the impact of
replica symmetry breaking is demonstrated for the energy penalty at the
transmitter. An analysis of spectral efficiency is provided to compare discrete
lattice-based relaxations against convex relaxations, as well as linear ZF and
Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP). Focusing on quaternary phase shift-keying
(QPSK), significant performance gains of both lattice and convex relaxations
are revealed compared to linear ZF precoding, for medium to high
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). THP is shown to be outperformed as well.

hard x-ray regime and the experimental demonstration of a possibility to
produce low-charge bunches with ultra-small normalized emittance have lead to
the discussions on optimistic scenarios of operation of the European XFEL. In
this paper we consider new options that make use of low-emittance beams, a
relatively high beam energy, tunable-gap undulators, and a multi-bunch
capability of this facility. We study the possibility of operation of a
spontaneous radiator (combining two of them, U1 and U2, in one beamline) in the
SASE mode in the designed photon energy range 20-90 keV and show that it
becomes possible with ultra-low emittance electron beams similar to those
generated in LCLS. As an additional attractive option we consider the
generation of powerful soft x-ray and VUV radiation by the same electron bunch
for pump-probe experiments, making use of recently invented compact afterburner
scheme. We also propose a betatron switcher as a simple, cheap, and robust
solution for multi-color operation of SASE1 and SASE2 undulators, allowing to
generate 2 to 5 x-ray beams of different independent colors from each of these
undulators for simultaneous multi-user operation. We describe a scheme for
pump-probe experiments, based on a production of two different colors by two
closely spaced electron bunches (produced in photoinjector) with the help of a
very fast betatron switcher. Finally, we discuss how without significant
modifications of the layout the European XFEL can become a unique facility that
continuously covers with powerful, coherent radiation a part of the
electromagnetic spectrum from far infrared to gamma-rays.

First, confinement induced acceleration of the dynamics of the molecules leads

due to thermal mismatch between the liquid and the surrounding host matrix,
negative pressure develops inside the pores with decreasing temperature, which
also shifts Tg to lower temperatures. Here we present novel dynamic mechanical

of the SASE2 undulator (256.2 m) is sufficient to independently generate three
pulses of different radiation wavelengths at saturation. Normally, if a SASE
FEL operates in saturation, the quality of the electron beam is too bad for
generation of SASE radiation in the subsequent part of undulator which is
resonant at a few times longer wavelength. The new method of SASE
undulator-switching based on the rapid switching of the FEL amplification
process proposed in this paper is an attempt to get around this obstacle. Using
mechanical SASE shutters installed within short magnetic chicanes in the
baseline undulator, it is possible to rapidly switch the FEL photon beam from
one wavelength to another, providing simultaneous multi-color capability.
Combining this method with a photon-beam distribution system can provide an
efficient way to generate a multi-user facility.

have proved to be problematic because they often vary in number (genes missing
or duplicated) and also in the secondary structure of the transcribed tRNAs (T
or D arms missing). I have performed a series of comparative analyses of the
tRNA genes of a broad range of Metazoan mitogenomes in order to address this
issue. I conclude that no single computer program is necessarily capable of
finding all of the tRNA genes in any given mitogenome, and that use of both the
ARWEN and DOGMA programs is sometimes necessary because they produce
complementary false negatives. There are apparently a very large number of
erroneous annotations in the databased mitogenome sequences, including missed
genes, wrongly annotated locations, false complements, and inconsistent
criteria for assigning the 5' and 3' boundaries; and I have listed many of
these. The extent of overlap between genes is often greatly exaggerated due to
inconsistent annotations, although notable overlaps involving tRNAs are
apparently real. Finally, three novel hypotheses were examined and found to
have support from the comparative analyses: (1) some organisms have mitogenomic
locations that simultaneously code for multiple tRNAs; (2) some organisms have
mitogenomic locations that simultaneously code for tRNAs and proteins (but not
rRNAs); and (3) one group of nematodes has several genes that code for tRNAs
lacking both the D and T arms.

rectangular region around the Northern Galactic Pole and have apparent r-band
magnitudes between 15 and 20.5 mag and spectral classes later than G5 (g-r >
0.5 mag). The data were taken from the Sixth Data Release of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. We model the 2PCF by means of the Wasserman-Weinberg technique
including several assumptions on the distribution of the binaries' orbital
parameters, luminosity function, and density distribution in the Galaxy. In
particular, we assume that the semi-major axis distribution is described by a
single powerlaw. The free model parameters - the local wide binary number
density and the power-law index of the semi-major axis distribution - are
inferred simultaneously by least-square fitting. We find the separation
distribution to follow Oepik's law up to the Galactic tidal limit, without any
break and a local density of 5 wide binaries per 1'000 cubic parsec with both
components having spectral type later than G5. This implies that about 10% of
all stars in the solar neighbourhood are members of such a late-type wide
binary system. With a relative statistical (2 sigma) error of about 10%, our
findings are in general agreement with previous studies of wide binaries. The
data suggest that about 800 very wide pairs with projected separations larger

datasets on commodity components, we present and evaluate StoreTorrent, a
simple distributed filesystem with integrated fault tolerance for efficient
handling of small data records. Our contributions include an application-OS
pipelining technique and metadata structure to increase small write and read
performance by a factor of 1-10, and the use of peer-to-peer communication of
replica-location indexes to avoid transferring data during parallel analysis
even in a degraded state. We evaluated StoreTorrent, PVFS, and Gluster
filesystems using 70 storage nodes and 560 parallel clients on an 8-core/node
Ethernet cluster with directly attached SATA disks. StoreTorrent performed
parallel small writes at an aggregate rate of 1.69 GB/s, and supported reads
over the network at 8.47 GB/s. We ported a parallel analysis task and
demonstrate it achieved parallel reads at the full aggregate speed of the
storage node local filesystems.

for genus two curves over finite fields of characteristic three. The algorithm
has an application in the context of curve based cryptography. One
distinguished property of the algorithm is that its complexity depends
quasi-quadratically on the degree of the finite base field. Our algorithm is a
modified version of an earlier method that was developed in joint work with
Lubicz. We explain how one can alter the original algorithm, on the basis of
new theory, such that it can be used to efficiently count points on genus two
curves over large finite fields. Examples of cryptographic size have been
computed using an experimental Magma implementation of the algorithm which has
been programmed by the author. Our computational results show that the
quasi-quadratic algorithm of Lubicz and the author, with some improvements, is
practical and relevant for cryptography.

observed in marine ecosystems. Three dynamical systems are considered,
describing the abundance of organisms as a function of body mass and time: a
""jump-growth"" equation, a first order approximation which is the widely used
McKendrick-von Foerster equation, and a second order approximation which is the
McKendrick-von Foerster equation with a diffusion term. All of these yield a
power-law steady state. We derive, for the first time, the eigenvalue spectrum
for the linearised evolution operator, under certain constraints on the
parameters. This provides new knowledge of the stability properties of the
power-law steady state. It is shown analytically that the steady state of the
McKendrick-von Foerster equation without the diffusion term is always unstable.
Furthermore, numerical plots show that eigenvalue spectra of the McKendrick-von
Foerster equation with diffusion give a good approximation to those of the
jump-growth equation. The steady state is more likely to be stable with a low
preferred predator : prey mass ratio, a large diet breadth and a high feeding
efficiency.

dwarf (WD) sample of the old Galactic open cluster M 67, down to the bottom of
the WD cooling sequence (CS). The color-magnitude diagram is based on data
collected with the LBC-Blue camera at the prime focus of LBT. As first epoch
data, we used CFHT-archive images collected 10 years before LBC data. We
measured proper motions of all the identified sources. Proper motions are then
used to separate foreground and background objects from the cluster stars,
including WDs. Finally, the field-object cleaned WD CS in the V vs. B-I
color-magnitude diagram is compared with the models. We confirm that the age
derived from the location of the bottom of the WD CS is consistent with the
turn off age.

Phys. 46, 043507","10.1063/1.1861275",,"math-ph math.MP quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An extension of the conditional expectations (those under a given subalgebra
of events and not the simple ones under a single event) from the classical to
the quantum case is presented. In the classical case, the conditional
expectations always exist; in the quantum case, however, they exist only if a
certain weak compatibility criterion is satisfied. This compatibility criterion
was introduced among others in a recent paper by the author. Then,
state-independent conditional expectations and quantum Markov processes are
studied. A classical Markov process is a probability measure, together with a
system of random variables, satisfying the Markov property and can equivalently
be described by a system of Markovian kernels (often forming a semigroup). This
equivalence is partly extended to quantum probabilities. It is shown that a
dynamical (semi)group can be derived from a given system of quantum observables
satisfying the Markov property, and the group generators are studied. The
results are presented in the framework of Jordan operator algebras, and a very
general type of observables (including the usual real-valued observables or
self-adjoint operators) is considered.

compute the Zero Point Energy (ZPE) which is compared to the same one generated
by a gravastar. We find that only when we set up a difference between ZPE in
these different background we can have an indication on which configuration is
favored. Such a ZPE difference represents the Casimir energy. It is shown that
the expression of the ZPE is equivalent to the one computed by means of a
variational approach. To handle with ZPE divergences, we use the zeta function
regularization. A renormalization procedure to remove the infinities together
with a renormalization group equation is introduced. We find that the final
configuration is dependent on the ratio between the radius of the wormhole
augmented by the ""brick wall"" and the radius of the gravastar.
