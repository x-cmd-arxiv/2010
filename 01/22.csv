explosive transients opened with the 2008 discovery of the dust-obscured
progenitors of the luminous outbursts in NGC 6946 and NGC 300. Here we carry
out a systematic mid-IR photometric search for massive, luminous, self-obscured
stars in four nearby galaxies: M33, NGC 300, M81, and NGC 6946. For detection,
we use only the 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron IRAC bands, as these can still be
used for multi-epoch Spitzer surveys of nearby galaxies (=<10 Mpc). We combine
familiar PSF and aperture-photometry with an innovative application of image
subtraction to catalog the self-obscured massive stars in these galaxies. In
particular, we verify that stars analogous to the progenitors of the NGC 6946
(SN 2008S) and NGC 300 transients are truly rare in all four galaxies: their
number may be as low as ~1 per galaxy at any given moment. This result
empirically supports the idea that the dust-enshrouded phase is a very
short-lived phenomenon in the lives of many massive stars and that these
objects constitute a natural extension of the AGB sequence. We also provide
mid-IR catalogs of sources in NGC 300, M81, and NGC 6946.

from the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) using the Chandra and XMM X-ray

Sculptor Wall, a large-scale superstructure of galaxies at z ~ 0.03. To verify
our initial detection, we obtained a deep (500 ks), follow-up exposure of
H2356-309 as part of the Cycle-10 Chandra Large Project Program. From a joint
analysis of the Cycle-10 and previous (Cycle-8) Chandra grating data we detect
the redshifted OVII WHIM line at a significance level of 3.4-sigma, a
substantial improvement over the 1.7-sigma level reported previously when using
only the Cycle-8 data. The significance increases to 4.0-sigma when the
existing XMM grating data are included in the analysis, thus confirming at
higher significance the existence of the line at the redshift of the Sculptor
Wall with an equivalent width of 28.5+/-10.5 mA (90% confidence). We obtain a
90% lower limit on the OVII column density of 0.8 10^16 cm^-2 and a 90% upper
limit on the Doppler-b parameter of 460 km/s. Assuming the absorber is
uniformly distributed throughout the ~ 15 Mpc portion of the blazar's
sight-line that intercepts the Sculptor Wall, that the OVII column density is ~
2 10^16 cm^-2 (corresponding to b > 150 km/s where the inferred column density
is only weakly dependent on b), and that the oxygen abundance is 0.1 solar, we
estimate a baryon over-density of ~ 30 for the WHIM, which is consistent with
the peak of the WHIM mass fraction predicted by cosmological simulations. The
clear detection of OVII absorption in the Sculptor Wall demonstrates the
viability of using current observatories to study WHIM in the X-ray absorption
spectra of blazars behind known large-scale structures.

of grains along a heap formed between two parallel sidewalls. Near the surface
the flow is steady and fast, while far below there is no flow whatsoever;
therefore, a jamming transition occurs where depth is an effective control
parameter for setting the distance from the transition. As seen previously, the
time-averaged velocity profile along the sidewall exhibits a nearly exponential
decay vs depth. Using speckle-visiblility spectroscopy (SVS), we find that
velocity fluctuations grow relative to the average on approach to jamming.
Introducing an image-based order parameter and the variance in its temporal
decay at a given depth, we also characterize the spatially heterogeneous nature
of the dynamics and find that it increases on approach to jamming. In
particular, the important time and length scales for dynamical heterogeneities
are found to grow almost exponentially as a function of depth. These dynamical
changes occur without noticeable change in structure, and are compared to
behavior found by experiment and simulation elsewhere in order to test the
universality of the jamming concept. In particular we find that the size of the
heterogeneities scales as the inertia number raised to the -1/3 power, in
agreement with two recent simulations.

have been mostly restricted to the low-$J$ states (lower total angular

survey of column densities for the molecular hydrogen in states of greater
rotational excitation ($J \geq 2$) in Galactic lines of sight with
$\log{\NHmol} \gtrsim 20$. This study is comprehensive through the highest
excited state detectable in each line of sight. J=5 is observed in every line
of sight, and we detect J=7 in four lines of sight, J=8 in one line of sight,
and vibrationally excited $\Hmol$ in two lines of sight. We compared the
apparent $b$-values and velocity offsets of the higher-$J$ states relative to
the dominant low-$J$ states and we found no evidence of any trends that might
provide insight into the formation of higher-$J$ $\Hmol$, although these
results are the most affected by the limits of the {\it FUSE} resolution. We
also derive excitation temperatures based on the column densities of the
different states. We confirm that at least two distinct temperatures are
necessary to adequately describe these lines of sight, and that more
temperatures are probably necessary. Total $\Hmol$ column density is known to
be correlated with other molecules; we explore if correlations vary as a
function of $J$ for several molecules, most importantly CH and CH$^+$. Finally,
we briefly discuss interpretations of selected lines of sight by comparing them

micro-roughness of the mirror. For reasonable choices of these quantities, the
modeled stray-light fraction agrees well with measurements of stray light made
both in the laboratory and during the UVCS mission. The models were constructed
for the bright H I Lyman alpha emission line, but they are applicable to other
spectral lines as well.

the accuracy of sensing ligand as the overcounting of the same ligand molecules

rigid Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian in $\C^n$, one can always find a family

that it holds in very general classes. But the disadvantage is that we do not

first overtone vibration of hydrogen cyanide, centered at 194 THz (1545 nm). We
measure the fully normalized, complex response of the gas over a 9 THz
bandwidth at 220 MHz frequency resolution yielding 41,000 resolution elements.
The average spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 2,500 for both the
fractional absorption and the phase, with a peak SNR of 4,000 corresponding to
a fractional absorption sensitivity of 0.025% and phase sensitivity of 250

(NRG) and the Friedel artificially inserted resonance (FAIR) theory fail sadly
for small samples where their predicted Kondo energy increases, while in
reality the Kondo effect disappears. Therefore a different, universal
definition of the Kondo energy is proposed, which uses the evasion of the
orthogonality catastrophe by the Kondo impurity. In the absense of the Kondo
effect the multi-electron scalar product (MESP) between all occupied spin-up
and spin-down states approaches zero (the so-called orthogonality catastrophe).
In contrast in the Kondo ground state the corresponding conduction electrons of
opposite spin are pairwise aligned within the Kondo energy. In the present
paper the MESP is investigated for the FAIR solution of the Friedel-Anderson
impurity. The MESP is numerically determined for the (enforced) magnetic and
the singlet states as a function of the number N of Wilson states. The magnetic
states show an exponentially decreasing MESP as a function of N. In the singlet
state the ground state requires a finite MESP to optimize its energy. As a
consequence there is no orthogonality catastrophe. Within the energy range of
the Kondo energy the scalar product between corresponding (single electron)
spin-up and spin-down states is very close to 1.000 and falls off beyond the
Kondo energy. The energy which separates the two regions is well suited as a
universal definition of the Kondo energy.

induced by a bias voltage $V$. This decoherence rate provides a cut-off to the
infrared divergences of the self-energy showing up in the Kondo regime. At low
temperature, the Kondo peak in the density of states is split into two peaks
pinned at the chemical potential of the two leads. The height of these peaks is
controlled by $\gamma^{(4)}$. The voltage dependence of the differential

conductance is found to be a universal function of the normalized bias voltage
$V/T_K$, where $T_K$ is the Kondo temperature. The universal scaling with a
single energy scale $T_K$ at low bias voltages is also observed for the
renormalized decoherence rate $\gamma^{(4)}/T_K$. We discuss the effect of

supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is large specific angular momentum. It is
feared that the gas settles in a large scale disc, and that accretion would
then proceed too inefficiently to explain the masses of the observed SMBHs.
Here we point out that, while the mean angular momentum in the bulge is very
likely to be large, the deviations from the mean can also be significant.
Indeed, cosmological simulations show that velocity and angular momentum fields
of gas flows onto galaxies are very complex. Furthermore, inside bulges the gas
velocity distribution can be further randomised by the velocity kicks due to
feedback from star formation. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of gaseous
rotating shells infalling onto an SMBH, attempting to quantify the importance
of velocity dispersion in the gas at relatively large distances from the black
hole. We implement this dispersion by means of a supersonic turbulent velocity
spectrum. We find that, while in the purely rotating case the circularisation
process leads to efficient mixing of gas with different angular momentum,
resulting in a low accretion rate, the inclusion of turbulence increases this
accretion rate by up to several orders of magnitude. We show that this can be
understood based on the notion of ""ballistic"" accretion, whereby dense
filaments, created by convergent turbulent flows, travel through the ambient
gas largely unaffected by hydrodynamical drag. We derive a simple analytical
formula that captures the numerical results to within a factor of a few.
Rescaling our results to astrophysical bulges, we argue that this ""ballistic""
mode of accretion could provide the SMBHs with a sufficient supply of fuel
without the need to channel the gas via large-scale discs or bars, and
therefore that star formation in bulges can be a strong catalyst for SMBH
accretion.

Taking account of current experimental constraints we compute the fine tuning
at two-loop order and determine the limits on the CMSSM parameter space and the
measurements at the LHC most relevant in covering it. Without imposing the
LEPII bound on the Higgs mass, it is shown that the fine tuning computed at
two-loop has a minimum $\Delta=8.8$ corresponding to a Higgs mass $m_h=114\pm
2$ GeV. Adding the constraint that the SUSY dark matter relic density should be
within present bounds we find $\Delta=15$ corresponding to $m_h=114.7\pm 2$ GeV

abundance within 3$\sigma$ of the WMAP constraint. We extend the analysis to

fine tuning and Higgs mass are only marginally larger for the case SUSY dark
matter is subdominant and rises to $\Delta=28.7$ ($m_h=116.98\pm 2$ GeV) for
the case of SUSY dark matter saturates the WMAP bound. For a Higgs mass above
these values, fine tuning rises exponentially fast. The CMSSM spectrum that
corresponds to minimal fine tuning is computed and provides a benchmark for
future searches. It is characterised by heavy squarks and sleptons and light
neutralinos, charginos and gluinos.

recently. In this paper we explore these features of the $t$ statistic in the
context of its application to very high dimensional problems, including feature
selection and ranking, highly multiple hypothesis testing, and sparse, high
dimensional signal detection. Robustness properties of the $t$-ratio are
highlighted, and it is established that those properties are preserved under
applications of the bootstrap. In particular, bootstrap methods correct for
skewness, and therefore lead to second-order accuracy, even in the extreme
tails. Indeed, it is shown that the bootstrap, and also the more popular but
less accurate $t$-distribution and normal approximations, are more effective in
the tails than towards the middle of the distribution. These properties
motivate new methods, for example bootstrap-based techniques for signal
detection, that confine attention to the significant tail of a statistic.

Taking advantage of the new ultra-deep VLT/VIMOS U-band number counts in the
GOODS-S field,we calculate the expected probability of contamination by low-z
interlopers as a function of the U-mag and the image spatial resolution (PSF).
Assuming that ground-based observations can not resolve objects lying within a
0.5"" radius of each other, then each z>=3 galaxy has a 2.1 and 3.2% chance of
foreground contamination, adopting surface density U-band number counts down to
27.5 and 28.5,respectively. Those probabilities increase to 8.5 and 12.6%,
assuming 1.0"" radius. If applied to the estimates reported in the literature at
z~3 for which a Lyman continuum has been observed directly,the probability that
at least 1/3 of them are affected by foreground contamination is larger than
50%.From a Monte-Carlo simulation we estimate the median integrated
contribution of foreground sources to the Lyman continuum flux (f900). Current
estimations from stacked data are >2 sigma of the median integrated pollution
by foreground sources.The spatial cross-correlation between the U-band catalog
and a sample of galaxies at z>=3.4 in the GOODS-S field,produces a number of
U-band detected systems fully consistent with the expected superposition
statistics. Indeed, each of them shows the presence of at least one offset
contaminant in the ACS images. An exemplary case of a foreground contamination
in the HUDF at redshift 3.797 by a foreground blue compact source (U=28.63 +/-
0.2) is reported; if observed with a seeing larger than 0.5"" the polluting
source would mimic an observed (f1500/f900)_OBS ~ 38, erroneously ascribed to

physics and has challenged us for decades. Spin has played an essential role
and often brought surprises and puzzles to the investigation of the nucleon
structure and the strong interaction. New experimental data on nucleon spin
structure at low to intermediate momentum transfers combined with existing high
momentum transfer data offer a comprehensive picture in the strong region of
the interaction and of the transition region from the strong to the
asymptotic-free region. Insight for some aspects of the theory for the strong
interaction, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is gained by exploring lower moments
of spin structure functions and their corresponding sum rules. These moments
are expressed in terms of an operator-product expansion using quark and gluon
degrees of freedom at moderately large momentum transfers. The higher-twist
contributions have been examined through the evolution of these moments as the
momentum transfer varies from higher to lower values. Furthermore, QCD-inspired
low-energy effective theories, which explicitly include chiral symmetry
breaking, are tested at low momentum transfers. The validity of these theories
is further examined as the momentum transfer increases to moderate values. It
is found that chiral perturbation theory calculations agree reasonably well
with the first moment of the spin structure function g_1 at low momentum
transfer of 0.05 - 0.1 GeV^2 but fail to reproduce some of the higher moments,
noticeably, the neutron data in the case of the generalized polarizability
Delta_LT. The Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule has been verified with good
accuracy in a wide range of Q^2 assuming that no singular behavior of the
structure functions is present at very high excitation energies.

We calculate the H I deficiency and find that the expected global trend for the
H I deficiency of these spirals to increase with projected proximity to the
cluster core, seen in clusters like Coma and Virgo, is not observed. We
classified the spirals into four evolutionary states, with the galaxies in each
state sharing a similar degree of H I deficiency and optical colour. The common
characteristics of the spirals in each evolutionary state suggests they have
been subject to similar environmental processes. Many of the spirals in the
most common evolutionary state (moderate H I deficiency and blue colour) have
an H I intensity maximum which is displaced relative to its optical
counterpart. The orientation of these offsets and magnitude of their H I
deficiencies together with data from other wavelengths provide observational
evidence in support of varying degrees of ram pressure stripping and tidal
interaction. In general, our results indicate that the H I disks of bright
late-type galaxies in the central part of the cluster are subject to both gas
loss and morphological disturbance as a result of their interaction with the
cluster environment. This provides further observational evidence of a more
complex environment in Abell 1367 as compared to Virgo and Coma.

deformation or the higher harmonics of the spiral spin configuration, which has

branches associated with the electromagnon, which can be tested by

analyze the {\it RXTE}/PCA data of GRS 1915+105 in its quasi-steady states, by

disk plus a thermal Comptonization model and take into consideration accurate
interstellar absorption, a reflection component, and absorption features from
the disk wind self-consistently. There is a strong correlation between the
inner disk temperature and the fraction of the disk component. Most of the
Comptonization-dominated spectra show $T_{\rm in} \sim 1$ keV with a high
electron temperature of $>10$ keV, which may correspond to the very high state
in canonical black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs). By contrast, the disk-dominated
spectra have $T_{\rm in} \sim 2$ keV with a low temperature ($<10$ keV) and
optically thick Comptonization, and show two separate branches in the ($L$ --
$T_{\rm in}$) diagram. The lower branch clearly follows the $L \propto T_{\rm
in}^4$-track. Furthermore, applying the extended disk blackbody model, we find
that 9 out of 12 datasets with disk luminosity above $0.3 L_{\rm E}$ prefer a
flatter temperature gradient than that in the standard disk ($p < 0.7$). We
interpret that, in the lower branch, the disk extends down to the innermost
stable circular orbit, and is most probably in the slim disk state. A rapidly
spinning black hole can explain both the lack of the $L \propto T_{\rm
in}^2$-track and a high value of spectral hardening factor ($\sim 4$) that
would be required for a non-rotating black hole. The spectra in the upper
branch are consistent with the picture of a truncated disk with low temperature
Comptonization. This state is uniquely observed from GRS 1915+105 among BHBs,
which may be present at near-Eddington luminosity.

driven by the exchange coupling. In our study two configurations for the
dot-lead coupling are considered: one where effectively only one channel
couples to the dot, and the other where the two dot orbitals have opposite
parities. Perturbative analysis in the weak-coupling limit reveals that the
system experiences transitions from 0 to $\pi$ (negative critical current)
behavior, depending on the parity of the orbitals and the spin correlation
between dot electrons. The strong coupling regime is tackled with the numerical
renormalization group method, which first characterizes the Kondo correlations
due to the dot-lead coupling and the exchange coupling in the absence of
superconductivity. In the presence of superconductivity, many-body correlations
such as two-stage Kondo effect compete with the superconductivity and the
comparison between the gap and the relevant Kondo temperature scales allows to
predict a rich variety of phase diagrams for the ground state of the system and
for the Josephson current. Numerical calculations predicts that our system can
exhibit Kondo-driven 0-$\pi$-0 or $\pi$-0-$\pi$ double transitions and, more
interestingly, that if proper conditions are met a Kondo-assisted
$\pi$-junction can arise, which is contrary to a common belief that the Kondo
effect opens a resonant level and makes the 0-junction. Our predictions could
be probed experimentally for a buckminster fullerene sandwiched between two

around 5 in top-gated graphene FETs. On the other hand, theoretical
investigations and optical measurements suggest that a bandgap up to a few
hundred meV can be created by the perpendicular E-field in bi-layer graphenes.
Although previous carrier transport measurements in bi-layer graphene
transistors did indicate a gate-induced insulating state at temperature below 1
Kelvin, the electrical (or transport) bandgap was estimated to be a few meV,
and the room temperature on/off current ratio in bi-layer graphene FETs remains
similar to those in single-layer graphene FETs. Here, for the first time, we
report an on/off current ratio of around 100 and 2000 at room temperature and

the measurements of the less abundant isotopic variants in order to minimize
the consequences of finite optical depths in the lines. The observations were
compared with the predictions of a free--fall gravitational collapse model,
which incorporates a non-equilibrium treatment of the relevant chemistry. We
found that CN, HCN, and HNC remain present in the gas phase at densities well
above that at which CO depletes on to grains. The CN:HCN and the HNC:HCN
abundance ratios are larger than unity in all the objects of our sample.
Furthermore, there is no observational evidence for large variations of these
ratios with increasing offset from the dust emission peak and hence with
density. Whilst the differential freeze--out of CN and CO can be understood in
terms of the current chemistry, the behaviour of the CN:HCN ratio is more
difficult to explain. Models suggest that most nitrogen is not in the gas phase
but may be locked in ices. Unambiguous conclusions require measurements of the
rate coefficients of the key neutral--neutral reactions at low temperatures.

be taken to address this issue seriously. This paper discusses some of the

engineers with better skills are produced. Changes to curriculum,
industry-academia collaboration through conferences, sabbaticals etc., industry

that have been discussed in this paper. The implementation of these measures
may lead to fulfilling the growing requirement for skilled software engineers

a significant influence on predictions at the LHC. New W and Z data from the

cross sections at the Tevatron. It is now possible to consistently calculate a
combined ""PDF+alpha_S"" uncertainty on hadronic cross sections, which is around
2-3% for the W and Z total cross sections at the LHC, reflecting their
potential as a ""standard candle"" to measure machine luminosity. Parton
luminosity functions are useful quantities for studying properties of hadronic

field and halo have been discovered. Their existence cannot be explained by the
process of star formation or by dynamical interactions in the field, and their
origin has long been a mystery. We explain the origin of these wide binaries by
formation during the dissolution phase of young star clusters: an initially
unbound pair of stars may form a binary when their distance in phase-space is
small. Using N-body simulations, we find that the resulting wide binary
fraction in the semi-major axis range 1000 au - 0.1 pc for individual clusters
is 1-30%, depending on the initial conditions. The existence of numerous wide
binaries in the field is consistent with observational evidence that most
clusters start out with a large degree of substructure. The wide binary
fraction decreases strongly with increasing cluster mass, and the semi-major
axis of the newly formed binaries is determined by the initial cluster size.
The resulting eccentricity distribution is thermal, and the mass ratio
distribution is consistent with gravitationally-focused random pairing. As a
large fraction of the stars form in primordial binaries, we predict that a
large number of the observed 'wide binaries' are in fact triple or quadruple
systems. By integrating over the initial cluster mass distribution, we predict
a binary fraction of a few per cent in the semi-major axis range 1000 au - 0.1
pc in the Galactic field, which is smaller than the observed wide binary
fraction. However, this discrepancy may be solved when we consider a broad
range of cluster morphologies.

matrices. The estimation of quantum channels is of great importance to the
field of quantum information. In this thesis two topics related to estimation
of quantum channels are investigated. The first of these is the upper bound of
Sarovar and Milburn (2006) on the Fisher information obtainable by measuring
the output of a channel. Two questions raised by Sarovar and Milburn about
their bound are answered. A Riemannian metric on the space of quantum states is
introduced, related to the construction of the Sarovar and Milburn bound. Its
properties are characterized. The second topic investigated is the estimation
of unitary channels. The situation is considered in which an experimenter has
several non-identical unitary channels that have the same parameter. It is
shown that it is possible to improve estimation using the channels together,
analogous to the case of identical unitary channels. Also, a new method of
phase estimation is given based on a method sketched by Kitaev (1996). Unlike
other phase estimation procedures which perform similarly, this procedure
requires only very basic experimental resources.

sources. The method is based on the definition of the luminosity distance and
its change along the time due to the cosmic expansion. It is argued that
galaxies may be chosen as the targets of the observation to perform the
measurement. We show that, by simultaneously increasing the observation time
and physically adding the fluences from different galaxies, the requirement on
the relative precision of the detector for an observation of 1 second on a
single galaxy can be relaxed to $10^{-5}$. Benefiting from the abundance of
galaxies in the universe, the method may be quite promising.

  Sr_3Ru_2O_7","PhD Thesis, University of St. Andrews",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Highly correlated electron materials are systems in which many new states of
matter can emerge. A particular situation which favours the formation of exotic
phases of the electron liquid in complex materials is that where a quantum
critical point (QCP) is present the phase diagram. Neighbouring regions in
parameter space reveal unusual physical properties, described as non-Fermi
liquid behaviour.
  One of the important problems in quantum criticality is to find out how the
Fermi surface (FS) of a material evolves near a QCP. The traditional method for
studying the FS of materials is the de Haas van Alphen effect (dHvA). A quantum
critical end point (QCEP) has been reported in the highly correlated metal
Sr3Ru2O7, which is tuned using a magnetic field high enough to perform the dHvA
experiment. It moreover features a new emergent phase in the vicinity of the
QCEP, a nematic type of electron ordering.
  The subject of this thesis is the study of the FS of Sr3Ru2O7 using the dHvA
effect. Three aspects were explored. The first was the determination of the FS
at fields both above and below that where the QCEP arises. The second was the
search for quantum oscillations inside the nematic phase. The third was a
reinvestigation of the behaviour of the quasiparticle effective masses near the
FS.
  A complete robust model for the FS of Sr3Ru2O7 at zero fields was determined.
Moreover, the new measurements of the quasiparticle masses revealed that no
mass enhancements exist anywhere around the QCEP. Finally, we report dHvA
oscillations inside the nematic phase, which suggests that the carriers consist
of Landau quasiparticles.

dielectric resonances as bulk graphite, but solid state theory indicates that
its features are about half as wide. Based on this theory, the dielectric
functions of mono- and multi-layer graphenes are deduced and compared with
those of terrestrial graphite. The resonance width of an ordered stack of
graphenes is found to increase with the number of layers while the central
frequency stays constant. This is the basis of the polycrystalline model of the
carrier of the 2175 Angstrom interstellar extinction band. In this model, the
carrier dust grains derive from parent hydrocarbon grains. As a grain ages in
the IS medium, the light atoms are expelled, hexagonal carbon rings lump
together into compact planar clusters, which then assemble into stacks of
parallel, equidistant, graphene-like layers. This so-called graphitization is
well known to occur in the earth or under strong heating. As the number of
layers in each stack increases and their relative orientational order improves,
the pi resonance width increases asymptotically towards that of terrestrial
graphite. Because of the initial random structure of the parent grains, many
randomly oriented stacks may coexist in the same grain. Calculations of the
dielectric response of this composite medium show that, for such a grain, the
width of the extinction efficiency peak follows the same trend as the pi
resonance of the average stack, and thus covers the observed range of IS
feature widths, at very nearly constant peak frequency.

between microwave WMAP anisotropies and the SDSS galaxy distribution. We repeat
these analyses to determine the different cross-correlation uncertainties
caused by re-sampling errors and field-to-field fluctuations. The first type of
error concerns overlapping sky regions, while the second type concerns
non-overlapping sky regions. METHODS. To measure the re-sampling errors, we use
bootstrap and jack-knife techniques. For the field-to-field fluctuations, we
use three methods: 1) evaluation of the dispersion in the cross-correlation
when correlating separated regions of WMAP with the original region of SDSS; 2)
use of mock Monte Carlo WMAP maps; 3) a new method (developed in this article),
which measures the error as a function of the integral of the product of the
self-correlations for each map. RESULTS. The average cross-correlation for b>30
deg. is significantly stronger than the re-sampling errors--both the jack-knife
and bootstrap techniques provide similar results--but it is of the order of the
field-to-field fluctuations. This is confirmed by the cross-correlation between
anisotropies and galaxies in more than the half of the sample being null within
re-sampling errors. CONCLUSIONS. Re-sampling methods underestimate the errors.
Field-to-field fluctuations dominate the detected signals. The ratio of signal
to re-sampling errors is larger than unity in a way that strongly depends on
the selected sky region. We therefore conclude that there is no evidence yet of
a significant detection of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. Hence, the
value of Omega_\Lambda ~ 0.8 obtained by the authors who assumed they were
observing the ISW effect would appear to have originated from noise analysis

systems occurring frequently in practical problems, is of first importance.
Experimentally, solving these systems with Gr\""obner bases algorithms seems to
be easier than solving homogeneous systems of the same degree. Nevertheless,
the reasons of this behaviour are not clear. In this paper, we focus on
bilinear systems (i.e. bihomogeneous systems where all equations have bidegree
(1,1)). Our goal is to provide a theoretical explanation of the aforementionned
experimental behaviour and to propose new techniques to speed up the Gr\""obner
basis computations by using the multihomogeneous structure of those systems.
The contributions are theoretical and practical. First, we adapt the classical
F5 criterion to avoid reductions to zero which occur when the input is a set of
bilinear polynomials. We also prove an explicit form of the Hilbert series of
bihomogeneous ideals generated by generic bilinear polynomials and give a new
upper bound on the degree of regularity of generic affine bilinear systems.
This leads to new complexity bounds for solving bilinear systems. We propose
also a variant of the F5 Algorithm dedicated to multihomogeneous systems which
exploits a structural property of the Macaulay matrix which occurs on such
inputs. Experimental results show that this variant requires less time and
memory than the classical homogeneous F5 Algorithm.

forcing by a short-period planet at the interface of convection and radiation
zones, approaching the centre of a solar-type star. We study at what amplitude
these wave are subject to instabilities. These instabilities lead to wave
breaking whenever the amplitude exceeds a critical value. Below this value, the
wave reflects perfectly from the centre of the star. Wave breaking results in
spinning up the central regions of the star, and the formation of a critical
layer, which acts as an absorbing barrier for ingoing waves. As these waves are
absorbed, the star is spun up from the inside out. This results in an important
amplitude dependence of the tidal quality factor Q'. If the tidal forcing
amplitude exceeds the value required for wave breaking, efficient dissipation
results over a continuous range of tidal frequencies, leading to Q' \approx
10^5 (P/1day)^(8/3), for the current Sun. This varies by less than a factor of
5 throughout the range of G and K type main sequence stars, for a given orbit.
We predict fewer giant planets with orbital periods of less than about 2 days
around such stars, if they cause breaking at the centre, due to the efficiency
of this process. This mechanism would, however, be ineffective in stars with a
convective core, such as WASP-18, WASP-12 and OGLE-TR-56, perhaps partly
explaining the survival of their close planetary companions.

$1/|{\bf R}|^3$ and displays $(1+\cos(2{\bf k}_D\cdot {\bf R})$-type
oscillations. A-A sublattice coupling is always ferromagnetic whereas A-B
subattice coupling is always antiferromagnetic and three times as large. We
also study the effect of edges in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) and find
that for impurities on the edge, the RKKY coupling decays exponentially because
of the localized zero energy edge states. For impurities inside a ZGNR the bulk
characteristics are quickly regained.

narrow Moebius strip of minimal bending energy, which was first formulated by
M. Sadowsky in 1930, we will develop the theory of elastic strips. Recently
E.L. Starostin and G.H.M. van der Heijden found a numerical description for an
elastic Moebius strip, but did not give an integrable solution. We derive two
conservation laws, which describe the equilibrium equations of elastic strips.
In applying these laws we find two new classes of integrable elastic strips
which correspond to spherical elastic curves. We establish a connection between
Hopf tori and force--free strips, which are defined by one of the integrable
strips, we have found. We introduce the P--functional and relate it to elastic
strips.

of so-called cycle rooted spanning forests (CRSFs). We construct natural
measures on CRSFs for which the edges form a determinantal process. This theory
gives a natural generalization of the spanning tree process adapted to graphs
embedded on surfaces. We give a number of other applications, for example, we

probability cannot be computed using the standard Laplacian alone.

ago in the Galaxy, where its membership to date numbers only eight. The
principal defining characteristic is a broad, centrally reversed He II
$\lambda$4686 emission profile; other emission and absorption lines are also
rotationally broadened. Recent surveys in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) have
brought the class membership there, including some related spectra, to 28. We
present a survey of the spectral morphology and rotational velocities, as a
first step toward elucidating the nature of this class. Evolved, rapidly
rotating hot stars are not expected theoretically, because the stellar winds
should brake the rotation. Luminosity classification of these spectra is not
possible, because the principal criterion (He II $\lambda$4686) is peculiar;
however, the MCs provide reliable absolute magnitudes, which show that they
span the entire range from dwarfs to supergiants. The Onfp line-broadening
distribution is distinct and shifted toward larger values from those of normal
O dwarfs and supergiants with >99.99% confidence. All cases with multiple
observations show line-profile variations, which even remove some objects from
the class temporarily. Some of them are spectroscopic binaries; it is possible
that the peculiar profiles may have multiple causes among different objects.
The origin and future of these stars are intriguing; for instance, they could
be stellar mergers and/or gamma-ray-burst progenitors.
