superstructure of an event, that is, features, such as color flow, which are
not determined by the jet four-momenta alone. Traditionally, an event is
described as having jets which are independent objects; each jet has some
energy, size, and possible substructure such as subjets or heavy flavor
content. This description discards information connecting the jets to each
other, which can be used to determine if the jets came from decay of a color
singlet object, or if they were initiated by quarks or gluons. An example
superstructure variable, pull, is presented as a simple handle on color flow.
It can be used on an event-by-event basis as a tool for distinguishing
previously irreducible backgrounds at the Tevatron and the LHC.

warped conifold region of a compactification with stabilized moduli. By
studying general ultraviolet perturbations in supergravity, we systematically
incorporate `compactification effects' sourced by supersymmetry breaking in the
compact space. Significant contributions to the D3-brane potential, including
the leading term in the infrared, arise from imaginary anti-self-dual (IASD)
fluxes. For an arbitrary Calabi-Yau cone, we determine the most general IASD
fluxes in terms of scalar harmonics, then compute the resulting D3-brane
potential. Specializing to the conifold, we identify the operator dual to each
mode of flux, and for chiral operators we confirm that the potential computed
in the gauge theory matches the gravity result. The effects of four-dimensional
curvature, including the leading D3-brane mass term, arise directly from the
ten-dimensional equations of motion. Furthermore, we show that gaugino
condensation on D7-branes provides a local source for IASD flux. This flux
precisely encodes the nonperturbative contributions to the D3-brane potential,
yielding a promising ten-dimensional representation of four-dimensional
nonperturbative effects. Our result encompasses all significant contributions
to the D3-brane potential discussed in the literature, and does so in the
single coherent framework of ten-dimensional supergravity. Moreover, we
identify new terms with irrational scaling dimensions that were inaccessible in
prior works. By decoupling gravity in a noncompact configuration, then
systematically reincorporating compactification effects as ultraviolet
perturbations, we have provided an approach in which Planck-suppressed
contributions to the D3-brane effective action can be computed.

the inspiral and merger of binary neutron star(NS)/black hole systems.
Maximizing the scientific return of a GW detection will require identifying a
coincident electro-magnetic (EM) counterpart. One of the most likely sources of
isotropic EM emission from compact object mergers is a supernova-like transient
powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in ejecta from
the merger. We present the first calculations of the optical transients from
compact object mergers that self-consistently determine the radioactive heating
by means of a nuclear reaction network; using this heating rate, we model the
light curve with a one dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer calculation.
For an ejecta mass ~1e-2 M_sun[1e-3 M_sun] the resulting light curve peaks on a
timescale ~ 1 day at a V-band luminosity nu L_nu ~ 3e41[1e41] ergs/s (M_V =
-15[-14]); this corresponds to an effective ""f"" parameter ~3e-6 in the
Li-Paczynski toy model. We argue that these results are relatively insensitive
to uncertainties in the relevant nuclear physics and to the precise early-time
dynamics and ejecta composition. Due to the rapid evolution and low luminosity
of NS merger transients, EM counterpart searches triggered by GW detections
will require close collaboration between the GW and astronomical communities.
NS merger transients may also be detectable following a short-duration
Gamma-Ray Burst or ""blindly"" with present or upcoming optical transient
surveys. Because the emission produced by NS merger ejecta is powered by the
formation of rare r-process elements, current optical transient surveys can
directly constrain the unknown origin of the heaviest elements in the Universe.

with the string width, the rigidity energy tends to stabilize small loops

low energy cost to flux lines crossings. Such knot is therefore excluded from
the dark matter scenario of Spergel and Steinhardt. However, the Q = 0 loop,

the electroweak strings are prevented from intercommuting due to much larger

theory landscape, it is argued that one can determine the structure of vacua
using precise measurements of the scalar spectral index and tensor

the energy gap between the minima is constant, i.e. $\epsilon_i=i m_f^4$, one
obtains the scalar spectral index, $n_s$, to be $\simeq 0.9687$, for the modes
that exit the horizon 60 e-folds before the end of inflation. Alternatively,
for a vacuum structure in which the energy gap increases linearly with the
vacuum index, i.e. $\epsilon_i=\frac{i^2}{2} m_f^4$, $n_s$ turns out to be
$\simeq 0.9614$. Both these two models are motivated within the string theory
landscape using flux-compactification and their predictions for scalar spectral
index are compatible with WMAP results. For both these two models, the results
for the scalar spectral index turn out to be independent of $m_f$. Nonetheless,
assuming that inflation started at Planckian energies and that there had been
successful thermalization at each step, one can constrain $m_f<2.6069\times
10^{-5} m_P$ and $m_f<6.5396\times 10^{-7} m_P$ in these two models,
respectively. Violation of the single-field consistency relation between the
tensor and scalar spectra is another prediction of chain inflation models. This
corresponds to having a smaller tensor/scalar ratio at large scales in
comparison with the slow-roll counterparts. Similar to slow-roll inflation, it
is argued that one can reconstruct the vacuum structure using the CMB
experiments.

would significantly affect Higgs searches at the LHC. The subsequent prompt
decay of N into three light fermions makes this Higgs decay effectively a
four-body decay. We further find that, in the presence of the large light-heavy

their standard-model counterparts and therefore could provide a potentially
important window to reveal the underlying seesaw mechanism.

precision measurements for helium abundance determinations. However, efforts to
determine the primordial helium abundance via observations of metal poor H II
regions have been limited by significant uncertainties. This work builds upon
previous work by providing an updated and extended program in evaluating these
uncertainties. Procedural consistency is achieved by integrating the hydrogen
based reddening correction with the helium based abundance calculation, i.e.,
all physical parameters are solved for simultaneously. We include new atomic
data for helium recombination and collisional emission based upon recent work
by Porter et al. and wavelength dependent corrections to underlying absorption
are investigated. The set of physical parameters has been expanded here to
include the effects of neutral hydrogen collisional emission. Because of a
degeneracy between the solutions for density and temperature, the precision of
the helium abundance determinations is limited. Also, at lower temperatures (T
\lesssim 13,000 K) the neutral hydrogen fraction is poorly constrained
resulting in a larger uncertainty in the helium abundances. Thus the derived
errors on the helium abundances for individual objects are larger than those
typical of previous studies. The updated emissivities and neutral hydrogen
correction generally raise the abundance. From a regression to zero
metallicity, we find Y_p as 0.2561 \pm 0.0108, in broad agreement with the WMAP
result. Tests with synthetic data show a potential for distinct improvement,
via removal of underlying absorption, using higher resolution spectra. A small
bias in the abundance determination can be reduced significantly and the
calculated helium abundance error can be reduced by \sim 25%.

are combined to obtain new maps at \wwav{3}{6} in total and polarized emission,

of the radio emission with observations of the neutral gas, derive radio
spectral index and Faraday depolarization maps, and model the large-scale
variation in Faraday rotation in order to deduce the structure of the regular
magnetic field. We find that the \wav{20} emission from the disc is severely
depolarized and that a dominating fraction of the observed polarized emission
at \wav{6} must be due to anisotropic small-scale magnetic fields. Taking this
into account, we derive two components for the regular magnetic field in this
galaxy: the disc is dominated by a combination of azimuthal modes, $m=0+2$, but
in the halo only an $m=1$ mode is required to fit the observations. We disuss
how the observed arm-interarm contrast in radio intensities can be reconciled
with evidence for strong gas compression in the spiral shocks. The average
arm--interam contrast, representative of the radii $r>2\kpc$ where the spiral
arms are broader, is not compatible with straightforward compression: lower
arm--interarm contrasts than expected may be due to resolution effects and
\emph{decompression} of the magnetic field as it leaves the arms. We suggest a
simple method to estimate the turbulent scale in the magneto-ionic medium from
the dependence of the standard deviation of the observed Faraday rotation
measure on resolution. We thus obtain an estimate of $50\pc$ for the size of

independence of the vector two-meson coupling that, in contrast, is violated

First we show that for any distance matrix there exist distances to a ""rogue

not contain any nontrivial splits (bipartitions) of the optimal tree for the
original data. Second, we prove a theorem which restricts the topology of

cannot have an arbitrary effect on the optimal tree. Third, we construct
polyhedral cones computationally which give complete answers for BME rogue
taxon behavior when our original data fits a tree on four, five, and six taxa.
We use these cones to derive sufficient conditions for rogue taxon behavior for
four taxa, and to understand the frequency of the rogue taxon effect via

pz-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonian and the non-equilibrium Green function
(NEGF) formalism for rigorous treatment of dissipative quantum transport. A
device level comparison of p-i-n TFETs and n-i-n MOSFETs in both ballistic and
dissipative cases has been performed previously. In this paper, the possibility
of using p-i-n TFETs in ultra-low power sub-threshold logic circuits is
investigated using a rigorous numerical simulator. The results show that, in
sub-threshold circuit operation, the p-i-n TFETs have better DC
characteristics, and can deliver ~15x higher performance at the iso-P_LEAKAGE,
iso-VDD conditions. Because p-i-n TFETs can operate at lower VDD than n-i-n
MOSFETs, they can deliver ~3x higher performance at the same power
(P_OPERATION). This results in ~3x energy reduction under iso-delay conditions.
Therefore the p-i-n TFETs are more suitable for sub-threshold logic operation.

the luminosity function of white dwarfs is best fitted if axions with a mass of
a few meV are included in the evolutionary calculations. Our aim is to show
that variable white dwarfs can provide additional and independent evidence
about the existence of axions. The evolution of a white dwarf is a slow cooling
process that translates into a secular increase of the pulsation periods of
some variable white dwarfs, the so-called DAV and DBV types. Since axions can
freely escape from such stars, their existence would increase the cooling rate
and, consequently, the rate of change of the periods as compared with the
standard ones. The present values of the rate of change of the pulsation period
of G117-B15A are compatible with the existence of axions with the masses
suggested by the luminosity function of white dwarfs, in contrast with previous
estimations. Furthermore, it is shown that if such axions indeed exist, the
drift of the periods of pulsation of DBV stars would be noticeably perturbed.

methods have become the tool of choice for numerical integration across the
quantitative sciences. Almost invariably, efficient MC integration schemes are
strictly designed to compute ratios of integrals, their efficiency being
intimately tied to the degree of overlap between the given integrands.
Consequently, substantial user insight is required prior to the use of such
methods, either to mitigate the oft-encountered lack of overlap in ratio
computations, or to find closely related integrands of known quadrature in
absolute integral estimation. Here a simple physical idea--measuring the volume
of a container by filling it up with an ideal gas--is exploited to design a new
class of MC integration schemes that can yield efficient, absolute integral
estimates for a broad class of integrands with simple transition matrices as
input. The methods are particularly useful in cases where existing (importance
sampling) strategies are most demanding, namely when the integrands are
concentrated in relatively small and unknown regions of configuration space
(e.g. physical systems in ordered/low-temperature phases). Examples ranging
from a volume with infinite support to the partition function of the 2D Ising

invariably exhibit cyclic field patterns which propagate away from the disc
midplane. A common explanation for this is magnetic buoyancy. The recent
analysis by Shi et al. however shows that the flow is buoyantly stable below
one disc scale height H, necessitating an alternative explanation in this
region. We here conduct and analyse direct numerical simulations to explain the
observed behaviour by means of a mean-field description. Apart from the mean
radial and azimuthal field, we monitor the small-scale current helicity, which
we propose as a key indicator for saturation. Reconstructing the horizontally
averaged field, we demonstrate that the problem can be reduced to a
one-dimensional induction equation. By means of the so-called test field
method, we then determine the underlying closure parameters. Our analysis shows
that, apart from a possible direct MRI dynamo, two distinct indirect dynamo
mechanisms operate in the disc. This resolves the issue of the ""wrong"" sign of
the MRI dynamo effect. Finally, we use the obtained closure parameters to run a
dynamically quenched dynamo model. This model approximately recovers the
observed field patterns in the mean fields. Moreover, the model reproduces the
prevailing parity and the distinct phase pattern in the small-scale current
helicity. The latter property might open a potential route to understand the
saturation of MRI induced turbulence.

identifying genetic modules whose behavior can be modeled accurately so as to
gain insight into their structure and function. However most gene circuits in a
cell are under control of external signals and thus quantitative agreement
between experimental data and a mathematical model is difficult. Circadian
biology has been one notable exception: quantitative models of the internal
clock that orchestrates biological processes over the 24-hour diurnal cycle
have been constructed for a few organisms, from cyanobacteria to plants and
mammals. In most cases, a complex architecture with interlocked feedback loops
has been evidenced. Here we present first modeling results for the circadian
clock of the green unicellular alga Ostreococcus tauri. Two plant-like clock
genes have been shown to play a central role in Ostreococcus clock. We find
that their expression time profiles can be accurately reproduced by a minimal
model of a two-gene transcriptional feedback loop. Remarkably, best adjustment
of data recorded under light/dark alternation is obtained when assuming that
the oscillator is not coupled to the diurnal cycle. This suggests that coupling
to light is confined to specific time intervals and has no dynamical effect
when the oscillator is entrained by the diurnal cycle. This intringuing
property may reflect a strategy to minimize the impact of fluctuations in
daylight intensity on the core circadian oscillator, a type of perturbation
that has been rarely considered when assessing the robustness of circadian
clocks.

inflation and the production of primordial perturbations, as well as a review
of some of the latest developments in this domain. After a short introduction,
we review the main principles of the Hot Big Bang model, as well as its
limitations. This motivates the study of cosmological inflation induced by a
slow-rolling scalar field. We then turn to the analysis of cosmological
perturbations, and explain how the vacuum quantum fluctuations are amplified
during an inflationary phase. The next step consists in relating the
perturbations generated during inflation to the perturbations of the
cosmological fluid in the radiation dominated phase. The final part of these
lectures gives a review of more general models of inflation, involving multiple
fields or non standard kinetic terms. Although more complicated, these models
are usually motivated by high energy physics and they can lead to specific
signatures that are not expected in the simplest models of inflation. After
introducing a very general formalism to describe perturbations in multi-field
models with arbitrary kinetic terms, several interesting cases are presented.
We also stress the role of entropy perturbations in the context of multi-field
models. Finally, we discuss in detail the non-Gaussianities of the primordial
perturbations and some models that could produce a detectable level of
non-Gaussianities.

drastically modified by the existence of very light axion-like particles
(ALPs), which are present in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle
physics. Basically, the propagation of photons emitted by a GRB through cosmic
magnetic fields with a domain-like structure induces photon-ALP mixing, which
is expected to produce a strong modification of the original photon
polarization. Because of the random orientation of the magnetic field in each
domain, this effect strongly depends on the orientation of the photon line of
sight. As a consequence, photon-ALP conversion considerably broadens the
original polarization distribution. Searching for such a peculiar feature
through future high-statistics polarimetric measurements is therefore a new
opportunity to discover very light ALPs.

rotating neutron stars. We model the stars in full general relativity and
describe the stellar matter adopting a cold realistic equation of state based
on the unified SLy prescription. We provide evidence that rapidly and
differentially rotating stars that are below the expected threshold for the
dynamical bar-mode instability, beta_c = T/|W| ~ 0.25, do nevertheless develop
a shear instability on a dynamical timescale and for a wide range of values of
beta. This class of instability, which has so far been found only for small
values of beta and with very small growth rates, is therefore more generic than
previously found and potentially more effective in producing strong sources of
gravitational waves. Overall, our findings support the phenomenological
predictions made by Watts, Andersson and Jones on the nature of the low-T/|W|.

blends of systems that are individually weaker. In the stacked spectra we
detect seven Lyman-series lines and metal lines of O VI, N V, C IV, C III, Si
IV, C II, Al II, Si II, Fe II, Mg II, and O I. Many of these lines have peak
optical depths of < 0.02, but they are nonetheless detected at high statistical
significance. Modeling the Lyman-series measurements implies that our selected
systems have total H I column densities N_HI ~ 10^15.4cm-2. Assuming typical
physical conditions rho / <rho> = 10, T = 10^4 - 10^4.5 K, and [Fe/H]= -2
yields reasonable agreement with the line strengths of high-ionization species,
but it underpredicts the low-ionization species by two orders of magnitude or
more. This discrepancy suggests that the low ionization lines arise in dense,
cool, metal-rich clumps, present in some absorption systems.

interactions of the oscillations with turbulence and magnetic fields. However,
many problems remain unsolved. In particular, the precision of the

strong magnetic field regions is inadequate for interpretation of MHD waves in
sunspots and for sunspot seismology. A new significant progress in studying the

Here we show that, in contrast to common belief, the most influential spreaders
in a social network do not correspond to the best connected people or to the
most central people (high betweenness centrality). Instead, we find: (i) The
most efficient spreaders are those located within the core of the network as
identified by the k-shell decomposition analysis. (ii) When multiple spreaders
are considered simultaneously, the distance between them becomes the crucial
parameter that determines the extend of the spreading. Furthermore, we find
that-- in the case of infections that do not confer immunity on recovered
individuals-- the infection persists in the high k-shell layers of the network
under conditions where hubs may not be able to preserve the infection. Our
analysis provides a plausible route for an optimal design of efficient
dissemination strategies.

upper tail, because available data need to rely on the ""legal"" rather than
""economic"" definition of cities for medium and small cities. To remedy this
difficulty, in this work we construct cities ""from the bottom up"" by clustering
populated areas obtained from high-resolution data. This method allows us to
investigate the population and area of cities for urban agglomerations of all
sizes using clustering methods from percolation theory. We find that Zipf's law
(a power law with exponent close to 1) for population holds for cities as small
as 12,000 inhabitants in the USA and 5,000 inhabitants in Great Britain. In
addition the distribution of city areas is also close to a Zipf's law. We
provide a parsimonious model with endogenous city area that is consistent with
those findings.

during meiosis is highly correlated with their physical length while it differs
significantly when their coding density is considered. Furthermore, it has been
observed that the recombination events are distributed unevenly along the
chromosomes. We have found that many of such recombination properties can be
predicted by computer simulations of population evolution based on the Monte
Carlo methods. For example, these simulations have shown that the probability
of acceptance of the recombination events by selection is higher at the ends of
chromosomes and lower in their middle parts. The regions of high coding density
are more prone to enter the strategy of haplotype complementation and to form
clusters of genes which are ""recombination deserts"". The phenomenon of
switching in-between the purifying selection and haplotype complementation has
a phase transition character, and many relations between the effective
population size, coding density, chromosome size and recombination frequency
are those of the power law type.

the exponential growth rates of vectors under the action of a linear cocycle on
R^d. When the linear actions are invertible, the MET guarantees an
almost-everywhere pointwise splitting of R^d into subspaces of distinct
exponential growth rates (called Lyapunov exponents). When the linear actions
are non-invertible, Oseledets' MET only yields the existence of a filtration of
subspaces, the elements of which contain all vectors that grow no faster than
exponential rates given by the Lyapunov exponents. The authors recently
demonstrated that a splitting over R^d is guaranteed even without the
invertibility assumption on the linear actions. Motivated by applications of
the MET to cocycles of (non-invertible) transfer operators arising from random
dynamical systems, we demonstrate the existence of an Oseledets splitting for
cocycles of quasi-compact non-invertible linear operators on Banach spaces.

direct relation between the macroscopic structure of vortices, such as particle
densities, and the low-lying quasiparticle state. In addition, the net angular
momentum for multiply quantized vortices with a vorticity $\kappa$ is found to
be expressed by a simple equation, which reflects the chirality of the Cooper
pairing. Hence, the observation of the particle density depletion and the
measurement of the angular momentum will provide the information on the
core-bound state and $p$-wave superfluidity. Moreover, the details on the zero
energy Majorana state are discussed in the vicinity of the BCS-to-BEC
evolution. It is demonstrated numerically that the zero energy Majorana state
appears in the weak coupling BCS limit only when the vortex winding number is
odd. There exist the $\kappa$ branches of the core bound states for a vortex
state with vorticity $\kappa$, whereas only one of them can be the zero energy.
This zero energy state vanishes at the BCS-BEC topological phase transition,

can be gauged in anomaly free way with the standard model gauge group. The
masses of these gauge bosons can be so light that it can induce long-range
forces on the Earth due to the electrons in the Sun. This type of forces can be
constrained significantly from neutrino oscillation. As the sign of the
potential is opposite for neutrinos and antineutrinos, a magnetized iron
calorimeter detector (ICAL) would be able to produce strong constraint on it.
We have made conservative studies of these long-range forces with atmospheric
neutrinos at ICAL considering only the muons of charge current interactions. We
find stringent bounds on the couplings $ \alpha_{e\mu, e\tau} \lapp 1.65 \times
10^{-53}$ at 3$\sigma$ CL with an exposure of 1 Mton$\cdot$yr if there is no
such force. For nonzero input values of the couplings we find that the
potential $V_{e\mu}$ opposes and $V_{e\tau}$ helps to discriminate the mass
hierarchy. However, both potentials help significantly to discriminate the
octant of $\theta_{23}$. The explanation of the anomaly in recent MINOS data
(the difference of $\Delta m^2_{32}$ for neutrinos and antineutrinos), using
long-range force originated from the mixing of the gauge boson $Z^\prime$ of
$L_\mu-L_\tau$ with the standard model gauge boson $Z$, can be tested at ICAL
at more than 5$\sigma$ CL. We have also discussed how to disentangle this from
the solution with CPT violation using the seasonal change of the distance

of growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. A proper
rescaling of time should introduce a non-trivial temporal dimension to these
limiting fluctuations. In one-dimension, the KPZ class has the dynamical
scaling exponent $z=3/2$, that means one should find a universal space-time
limiting process under the scaling of time as $t\,T$, space like $t^{2/3} X$
and fluctuations like $t^{1/3}$ as $t\to\infty$.
  In this paper we provide evidence for this belief. We prove that under
certain hypotheses, growth models display temporal slow decorrelation. That is
to say that in the scalings above, the limiting spatial process for times $t\,
T$ and $t\, T+t^{\nu}$ are identical, for any $\nu<1$. The hypotheses are known
to be satisfied for certain last passage percolation models, the polynuclear
growth model, and the totally / partially asymmetric simple exclusion process.
Using slow decorrelation we may extend known fluctuation limit results to
space-time regions where correlation functions are unknown.
  The approach we develop requires the minimal expected hypotheses for slow
decorrelation to hold and provides a simple and intuitive proof which applied
to a wide variety of models.

stability of periodic solutions emerged by Hopf bifurcation from a certain
equilibrium point. We give the algorithm for approximating a center manifold at
a typical point (in the parameter space) of Hopf bifurcation (and an unstable
manifold in the vicinity of such a point, where such a manifold exists). Then
we find the normal form of the equation restricted to the center manifold, by
computing the first Lyapunov coefficient. The normal form allows us to
establish the stability properties of the periodic solutions occurred by Hopf
bifurcation.

arises for product estimates in these spaces. Unfortunately, it seems that with
every new application some estimates come up which have not yet appeared in the
literature, and then one has to resort to a set of well-established procedures
for proving the missing estimates. To relieve the tedium of having to
constantly fill in such gaps ""by hand"", we make here a systematic effort to
determine the complete set of estimates in the bilinear case. We determine a
set of necessary conditions for a product estimate $H^{s_1,b_1} \cdot

edges, give product estimates. We can also allow some but not all points on the
edges, but here we do not claim to have the sharp result. The corresponding

scale restricts the characteristic size of QED interaction to 15.7x10^{-18} cm,
we perform an effort to assign in a semi-mechanical way all available

object can be modeled as a classical gyroscope consisted of a non rotating
inner massive kernel surrounded by an outer rotating massive layer equipped
with charged sorted in a way to match the charge contents for different

elements (CEMP-s) have been observed in the Galactic halo. These stars of low
mass (M ~ 0.9 Msun) are located on the main-sequence or the red giant phase,
and do not undergo third dredge-up (TDU) episodes. The s-process enhancement is
most plausibly due to accretion in a binary system from a more massive
companion when on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase (now a white dwarf).
In order to interpret the spectroscopic observations, updated AGB models are
needed to follow in detail the s-process nucleosynthesis. We present
nucleosynthesis calculations based on AGB stellar models obtained with FRANEC
(Frascati Raphson-Newton Evolutionary Code) for low initial stellar masses and
low metallicities. For a given metallicity, a wide spread in the abundances of
the s-process elements is obtained by varying the amount of 13C and its profile
in the pocket, where the 13C(a, n)16O reaction is the major neutron source,
releasing neutrons in radiative conditions during the interpulse phase. We
account also for the second neutron source 22Ne(a, n)25Mg, partially activated
during convective thermal pulses. We discuss the surface abundance of elements
from carbon to bismuth, for AGB models of initial masses M = 1.3 -- 2 Msun, low
metallicities ([Fe/H] from -1 down to -3.6) and for different 13C-pockets
efficiencies. In particular we analyse the relative behaviour of the three
s-process peaks: light-s (ls at magic neutron number N = 50), heavy-s (hs at N
= 82) and lead (N = 126). Two s-process indicators, [hs/ls] and [Pb/hs], are
needed in order to characterise the s-process distribution. In the online
material, we provide a set of data tables with surface predictions. ...

of the Schr\""odinger's equation in the frames of the well-known general method
of separation of variables. To solve this task, we use the well-known
cylindrical coordinates in Riemann and Lobachevsky spaces, naturally related
with Euler angle-parameters. Conclusion may be drawn: the general method of
separation of variables embraces the all plane wave solutions; the plane waves
in Lobachevsky and Riemann space consist of a small part of the whole set of
basis wave functions of Schr\""odinger equation.
  In space of constant positive curvature $S_{3}$, a complex analog of
horospherical coordinates of Lobachevsky space $H_{3}$ is introduced. To
parameterize real space $S_{3}$, two complex coordinates $(r,z)$ must obey
additional restriction in the form of the equation $r^{2} = e^{z-z^{*}} -
e^{2z} $. The metrical tensor of space $S_{3}$ is expressed in terms of $(r,z)$
with additional constraint, or through pairs of conjugate variables $(r,r^{*})$
or $(z,z^{*})$; correspondingly exist three different representations for
Schr\""{o}dinger Hamiltonian. Shapiro plane waves are determined and explored as
solutions of Schr\""odinger equation in complex horosperical coordinates of
$S_{3}$. In particular, two oppositely directed plane waves may be presented as
exponentials in conjugated coordinates. $\Psi_{-}= e^{-\alpha z}$ and
$\Psi_{+}= e^{-\alpha z^{*}}$. Solutions constructed are single-valued, finite,
and continuous functions in spherical space and correspond to discrete energy

(LMXB) can be heated by the external X-ray source which may appear due to the
accretion process onto a companion compact object (a neutron star or a black
hole). As a result, the surface temperature of the star can become
significantly higher than it is in the normal state resulting from
thermonuclear burning. We wonder whether high energy electrons and gamma-rays,
injected within the binary system, can efficiently interact with this enhanced
radiation field. To decide this, we calculate the optical depths for the
gamma-ray photons in the radiation field of such irradiated star as a function
of the phase of the binary system. Based on these calculations, we conclude
that compact low mass X-ray binary systems may also become sources of high
energy gamma-rays since conditions for interaction of electrons and gamma-rays
are quite similar to these ones observed within the high mass TeV gamma-ray
binaries such as LS 5039 and LSI 303 +61. However, due to differences in the
soft radiation field, the expected gamma-ray light curves can significantly
differ between low mass and high mass X-ray binaries. As an example, we apply
such calculations to two well known LMXBs: Her X-1 and Sco X-1. It is concluded
that electrons accelerated to high energies inside these binaries should find
enough soft photon target from the companion star for efficient gamma-ray
production.

shown that they are set-theoretically complete intersections, revisiting the
work of Bresinsky and of Valla. Even when the three elements are taken to be
variables in a polynomial ring in three variables over a field, this point of
view gives a larger class of ideals than just the defining ideals of monomial
curves. We then characterize when the ideals in this larger class are prime, we
show that they are usually radical and, using the theory of multiplicities, we
give upper bounds on the number of their minimal prime ideals, one of these
primes being a uniquely determined prime ideal of definition of a monomial
curve. Finally, we provide examples of characteristic-dependent minimal prime
and primary structures for these ideals.

that in addition to a large halo surrounding the baryonic component of our

of kiloparsecs beyond the edge of the observable Milky Way. We find that for
dark matter (DM) annihilation models, galactic subhalos can significantly
modify the spectrum of electrons and positrons as measured at our galactic
position. Using data from the recent Via Lactea II simulation we include the
subhalo contribution of electrons and positrons as boundary source terms for
simulations of high energy cosmic ray propagation with a modified version of
the publicly available GALPROP code. Focusing on the DM DM -> 4e annihilation
channel, we show that including subhalos leads to a better fit to both the
Fermi and PAMELA data. The best fit gives a dark matter particle mass of 1.2
TeV, for boost factors of 90 in the main halo and 1950-3800 in the subhalos
(depending on assumptions about the background), in contrast to the 0.85 TeV
mass that gives the best fit in the main halo-only scenario. These fits suggest
that at least a third of the observed electron cosmic rays from DM annihilation
could come from subhalos, opening up the possibility of a relaxation of recent
stringent constraints from inverse Compton gamma rays originating from the
high-energy leptons.

a liquid surface: upon impact a thin liquid sheet is thrown upwards all around
the rim of the impactor while in its wake a large surface cavity forms. Under
the influence of hydrostatic pressure the cavity immediately starts to collapse
and eventually closes in a single point from which a thin, needle-like jet is
ejected. Existing numerical treatments of liquid impact either consider the
surrounding air as an incompressible fluid or neglect air effects altogether.
In contrast, our approach couples a boundary-integral method for the liquid
with a Roe scheme for the gas domain and is thus able to handle the fully
\emph{compressible} gas stream that is pushed out of the collapsing impact
cavity. Taking into account air compressibility is crucial, since, as we show
in this work, the impact crater collapses so violently that the air flow
through the cavity neck attains supersonic velocities already at cavity
diameters larger than 1 mm. Our computational results are validated through

environments? In large spiral galaxies, the rate of transformation of H2 into
stars (hereafter SFE) varies little. However, the SFE in distant objects (z~1)
is much higher than in the large spiral disks that dominate the local universe.
Some small local group galaxies share at least some of the characteristics of
intermediate-redshift objects, such as size or color. Recent work has suggested
that the Star Formation Efficiency (SFE, defined as the SFRate per unit H2) in
local Dwarf galaxies may be as high as in the distant objects. A fundamental
difficulty in these studies is the independent measure of the H2 mass in
metal-deficient environments. At 490 kpc, NGC6822 is an excellent choice for
this study; it has been mapped in the CO(2-1) line using the multibeam receiver
HERA on the 30 meter IRAM telescope, yielding the largest sample of giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) in this galaxy. Despite the much lower metallicity, we
find no clear difference in the properties of the GMCs in NGC 6822 and those in
the Milky Way except lower CO luminosities for a given mass. Several
independent methods indicate that the total H2 mass in NGC 6822 is about 5 x
10^6 Msun in the area we mapped and less than 10^7 Msun in the whole galaxy.
This corresponds to a NH2/ICO ~ 4 x 10^{21} cm^-2 /(Kkm/s) over large scales,
such as would be observed in distant objects, and half that in individual GMCs.
No evidence was found for H2 without CO emission. Our simulations of the
radiative transfer in clouds are entirely compatible with these NH2/ICO values.
The SFE implied is a factor 5 - 10 higher than what is observed in large local
universe spirals.

encounters occurring during their merging histories. We show that, within this
framework, the ratio Gamma=(M_BH/M_*)(z)/(M_BH/M_*)(z=0) between the Black Hole
mass and the galactic stellar mass (normalized to the local value) depends on
both BH mass and redshift. While the average value and the spread of Gamma(z)
increase with z, such an effect is larger for massive BHs, reaching values
Gamma=5 for massive Black Holes (M>10^9 M_{\odot}) at z>4, in agreement with
recent observations of high-redshift QSOs; this is due to the effectiveness of
interactions in triggering BH accretion in high-density environments at high
redshifts. To test such a model against observations, we worked out specific
predictions for sub-samples of the simulated galaxies corresponding to the
different observational samples for which measurements of Gamma have been
obtained. We found that for Broad Line AGNs at 1<z<2 values of Gamma=2 are
expected, with a mild trend toward larger value for increasing BH mass.
Instead, when we select from our Monte Carlo simulations only extremely gas
rich, rapidly star forming galaxies at 2<z<3, we find low values 0.3<Gamma<1.5,
consistent with recent observational findings on samples of sub-mm galaxies; in
the framework of our model, these objects end up at z=0 in low-to-intermediate
mass BHs (M<10^9 M_{\odot}), and they do not represent typical paths leading to
local massive galaxies. The latter have formed preferentially through paths
passing above the local M_*-M_BH relation. We discuss how the global picture
emerging from the model is consistent with a downsizing scenario, where massive
BHs accrete a larger fraction of their final mass at high redshifts z>4.

detection of the emission from the neutron star surface. Based on the whole set

stars, obtained by combining the new data with existing optical observations,

[M/H] = -1.51 (uncorrected) or [M/H] = -1.24 +/- 0.05 (int) +/- 0.15 (syst)
after correction for the mean age of Leo I stars. This is consistent with the
results from spectroscopy once stellar ages are taken into account. Using a
near-infrared two-colour diagram, we discriminate between carbon- and
oxygen-rich AGB stars and obtain a clean separation from Milky Way foreground
stars. We reveal a concentration of C-type AGB stars relative to the red giant
stars in the inner region of the galaxy, which implies a radial gradient in the
intermediate-age (1-3 Gyr) stellar populations. The numbers and luminosities of
the observed carbon- and oxygen-rich AGB stars are compared with those
predicted by evolutionary models including the thermally-pulsing AGB phase, to
provide new constraints to the models for low-metallicity stars. We find an
excess in the predicted number of C stars fainter than the RGB tip, associated
to a paucity of brighter ones. The number of O-rich AGB stars is roughly
consistent with the models, yet their predicted luminosity function is extended
to brighter luminosity. It appears likely that the adopted evolutionary models
overestimate the C star lifetime and underestimate their K-band luminosity.

grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy is studied by high resolution
synchrotron x-ray diffraction and absorption, transmission electron microscopy,
and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry as a function of
the growth temperature $T_{\mathrm{g}}$. Three contributions to the
magnetization are identified: i) paramagnetic -- originating from dilute and
non-interacting Fe$^{3+}$ ions substitutional of Ga, and dominating in layers
obtained at the lowest considered $T_{\mathrm{g}}$ (800$^{\circ}$C); ii)
superparamagnetic-like -- brought about mainly by ferromagnetic nanocrystals of
$\epsilon-$Fe$_3$N but also by $\gamma'$-Fe$_4$N and by inclusions of elemental
$\alpha$- and $\gamma$-Fe, and prevalent in films obtained in the intermediate
$T_{\mathrm{g}}$ range; iii) component linear in the magnetic field and
associated with antiferromagnetic interactions -- found to originate from
highly nitridated Fe$_x$N ($x \leq$ 2) phases, like $\zeta$-Fe$_2$N, and
detected in samples deposited at the highest employed temperature,
$T_{\mathrm{g}}$ = 950$^{\circ}$C. Furthermore, depending on $T_{\mathrm{g}}$,
the Fe-rich nanocrystals segregate towards the sample surface or occupy
two-dimensional planes perpendicular to the growth direction.

stacked Spitzer data at 3.6um. The sample contains type-1 and type-2 AGN in the
form of quasars and radio galaxies, and spans a large range in both optical and
radio luminosity. We find, on average, that 2 to 3 massive galaxies containing
a substantial evolved stellar population lie within a 200-300 kpc radius of the
AGN, constituting a >8-sigma excess relative to the field. Secondly, we find
evidence for the environmental source density to increase with the radio
luminosity of AGN, but not with black-hole mass. This is shown first by
dividing the AGN into their classical AGN types, where we see more significant
over-densities in the fields of the radio-loud AGN. If instead we dispense with
the classical AGN definitions, we find that the source over-density as a
function of radio luminosity for all our AGN exhibits a positive correlation.
One interpretation of this result is that the Mpc-scale environment is in some
way influencing the radio emission that we observe from AGN. This could be
explained by the confinement of radio jets in dense environments leading to
enhanced radio emission or, alternatively, may be linked to more rapid
black-hole spin brought on by galaxy mergers.

works. The famous Hodgkin-Huxley model, which describes how action potentials
of a neuron are initiated and propagated, consists of four coupled nonlinear
differential equations. Because these equations are difficult to deal with,
there also exist several simplified models, of which many exhibit
polynomial-like non-linearity. Examples of such models are the Fitzhugh-Nagumo
(FHN) model, the Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) model, the Morris-Lecar (ML) model and the
Izhikevich model. In this work, we first prescribe the biologically relevant
parameter ranges for the FHN model and subsequently study the dynamical
behaviour of coupled neurons on small networks of two or three nodes. To do
this, we use a computational real algebraic geometry method called the
Discriminant Variety (DV) method to perform the stability and bifurcation
analysis of these small networks. A time series analysis of the FHN model can
be found elsewhere in related work[15].
