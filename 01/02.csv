control-dependent term rewarding submaximal control utilization. A moderation
incentive is identically zero on the boundary of the admissible control region
and non-negative on the interior; it is bounded above by the infimum of the
state-dependent cost function, so that the instantaneous total cost is always
non-negative. The conservation law determined by the Maximum Principle, in
combination with the condition that the moderation incentive equal zero on the
boundary of the admissible control region, plays a crucial role in the
analysis; in some situations, the initial and final values of the auxiliary
variable are uniquely determined by the condition that the conserved quantity
equal zero along a solution of the arbitrary duration synthesis problem. Use of
an alternate system of evolution equations, parametrized by the auxiliary
variable, for one-degree of freedom controlled acceleration systems, can
significantly simplify numerical searches for solutions of the arbitrary
duration synthesis problem. A one-parameter family of 'elliptical' moderation
incentives is introduced; the behavior of the well-known quadratic control cost
and its incentive analog is compared to that of the elliptical incentives in
two simple controlled acceleration examples. The elliptical incentives yield
smooth solutions with controls remaining in the interior of the admissible
region, while the quadratic incentive allows piecewise smooth solutions with
controls moving on and off the boundary of the admissible region; in these
examples, the arbitrary duration synthesis problem for the traditional
quadratic control cost has no solution; the total cost is a monotonically
decreasing function of the duration.

pulsed laser beam at 532 nm, which triggers the change in the resonance

that fast switching of 50 us can be achieved by injecting a blue laser beam at
410 nm that helps in truncating the BR photocycle at the M intermediate state.
Realization of all-optical switch with BR coated microcavity switch has been
done experimentally. Based on this basic switch configuration, designs of
all-optical higher computing circuits have been presented. The design requires
2n-1 switches to realize n bit computation. The proposed designs require less
number of switches than terahertz optical asymmetric demultiplexer based
interferometer designs. The combined advantages of high Q factor, tunability,
compactness and low power control signals, with the flexibility of cascading
switches to form circuits, makes the designs promising for practical
applications. The design combines the exceptional sensitivities of BR and
microcavities for realizing low power circuits and networks. The designs are

(GLMs) is able to encompass most of them, ranging from Linear Multistep
Formulae (LMF) to RK formulae. Moreover, it is possible to obtain methods able
to overcome typical drawbacks of the previous classes of methods. For example,
order barriers for stable LMF and the problem of order reduction for RK
methods. Nevertheless, these goals are usually achieved at the price of a
higher computational cost. Consequently, many efforts have been made in order
to derive GLMs with particular features, to be exploited for their efficient
implementation. In recent years, the derivation of GLMs from particular
Boundary Value Methods (BVMs), namely the family of Generalized BDF (GBDF), has
been proposed for the numerical solution of stiff ODE-IVPs. In particular, this
approach has been recently developed, resulting in a new family of L-stable
GLMs of arbitrarily high order, whose theory is here completed and fully
worked-out. Moreover, for each one of such methods, it is possible to define a
corresponding Blended GLM which is equivalent to it from the point of view of
the stability and order properties. These blended methods, in turn, allow the
definition of efficient nonlinear splittings for solving the generated discrete
problems. A few numerical tests, confirming the excellent potential of such
blended methods, are also reported.

attempts to determine the inclination of A0620 using subsets of these data have
yielded a wide range of measured values of i. Differences in the measured value
of i have been due to changes in the shape of the light curve and uncertainty
regarding the contamination from the disk. We give a new technique for
estimating the disk fraction and find that disk light is significant in all
light curves, even in the infrared. We also find that all changes in the shape
and normalization of the light curve originate in a variable disk component.
After accounting for this disk component, we find that all the data, including
light curves of significantly different shapes, point to a consistent value of
i. Combining results from many separate data sets, we find i=51 plus or minus
0.9 degrees, implying M=6.6 plus or minus 0.25 solar masses. Using our
dynamical model and zero-disk stellar VIH magnitudes, we find d=1.06 plus or

cosmology that selects inflationary histories and remains well behaved for
spatially large or infinite universes. This paper explores the predictions of
the NBWF for linear scalar fluctuations about homogeneous and isotropic
backgrounds in models with a single scalar field moving in a quadratic
potential. We treat both the space-time geometry of the universe and the
observers inhabiting it quantum mechanically. We evaluate top-down
probabilities for local observations that are conditioned on the NBWF and on
part of our data as observers of the universe. For models where the most
probable histories do not have a regime of eternal inflation, the NBWF predicts
homogeneity on large scales, a specific non-Gaussian spectrum of observable
fluctuations, and a small amount of inflation in our past. By contrast, for
models where the dominant histories have a regime of eternal inflation, the
NBWF predicts significant inhomogeneity on scales much larger than the present
horizon, a Gaussian spectrum of observable fluctuations, and a long period of
inflation in our past. The absence or presence of local non-Gaussianity
therefore provides information about the global structure of the universe,
assuming the NBWF.

A technique is developed based on the concept of an uncountable set of time

system. We adopt this perspective as a natural extension of the commonly used
discrete set of timescales and OPs which is practical when only a few,
widely-separated scales exist. The existence of a gap in the spectrum of
timescales for such a system (under quasiequilibrium conditions) is used to
introduce a continuous scaling and perform a multiscale analysis of the
Liouville equation. A functional-differential Smoluchowski equation is derived
for the stochastic dynamics of the continuum of Fourier component order
parameters. A continuum of spatially non-local Langevin equations for the OPs
is also derived. The theory is demonstrated via the analysis of structural
transitions in a composite material, as occurs for viral capsids and molecular

behavioral finance on imitation and herding of investors and traders and (iii)
the mathematical and statistical physics of bifurcations and phase transitions,
the log-periodic power law (LPPL) model has been developed as a flexible tool
to detect bubbles. The LPPL model considers the faster-than-exponential (power
law with finite-time singularity) increase in asset prices decorated by
accelerating oscillations as the main diagnostic of bubbles. It embodies a
positive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negative
feedback spirals of crash expectations. The power of the LPPL model is
illustrated by two recent real-life predictions performed recently by our
group: the peak of the Oil price bubble in early July 2008 and the burst of a
bubble on the Shanghai stock market in early August 2009. We then present the
concept of ""negative bubbles"", which are the mirror images of positive bubbles.
We argue that similar positive feedbacks are at work to fuel these accelerated
downward price spirals. We adapt the LPPL model to these negative bubbles and
implement a pattern recognition method to predict the end times of the negative
bubbles, which are characterized by rebounds (the mirror images of crashes
associated with the standard positive bubbles). The out-of-sample tests
quantified by error diagrams demonstrate the high significance of the
prediction performance.

exact, without truncation errors in traditional perturbation series expansions.
This model consists of a honeycomb lattice of clusters of four spin-1/2
moments, and contains short-range interactions up to six-spin(or eight-spin)
terms. The spin in the Kitaev model is represented not as these spin-1/2
moments, but as pseudo-spin of the two-dimensional spin singlet sector of the
four antiferromagnetically coupled spin-1/2 moments within each cluster. Spin
correlations in the Kitaev model are mapped to dimer correlations or
spin-chirality correlations in this model. This exact construction is quite
general and can be used to make other interesting spin-1/2 models from spin
rotation invariant Hamiltonians. We discuss two possible routes to generate the
high order spin interactions from more natural couplings, which involves
perturbative expansions thus breaks the exact mapping, although in a controlled

of order parameter field variables that are shown to evolve slowly via Newton's
equations. The separation of timescales between that of atomic collisions and
the order parameter fields enables the derivation of rigorous equations for
stochastic order parameter field dynamics. When the fields provide a measure of
the spatial profile of the probability of molecular position, orientation, and
internal structure, a theory of liquid-crystal transitions emerges. The theory
uses the all-atom/continuum approach developed earlier to obtain a functional
generalization of the Smoluchowski equation wherein key atomic details are
embedded. The equivalent non-local Langevin equations are derived and
computational aspects are discussed. The theory enables simulations that are
much less computationally intensive than molecular dynamics and thus does not
require oversimplification of the system's constituent components. The
equations obtained do not include factors that require calibration and can thus
be applicable to various phase transitions which overcomes the limitations of
phenomenological field models. The relation of the theory to phenomenological
descriptions of Nematic and Smectic phase transitions, and the possible
existence of other types of transitions involving intermolecular structural
parameters are discussed.

proposed a version for the dynamical horizon of the universe, which validates
the entropy bound conjecture for the cosmology filled with perfect fluid in the
classical scenario when the universe is far away from the big bang singularity.
However, their conjecture breaks down near big bang region. We examine this

relative shifts between the lines of different ions compared. Profiles of lines
of RW Hya and Z And were also examined. The reality of the relative shift
between resonance and intercombination lines of several times ionised atoms was
clearly shown except for AG Dra. This redshift shows a well defined variation
with orbital phase for Z And and RW Hya. In addition the intercombination lines
from more ionised atoms and especially OIV are redshifted with respect to those
from less ionised atoms. Other effects are seen in the profiles. The
resonance-intercombination line shift variation can be explained in quiescence
by P Cygni shorter wavelength component absorption, due to the wind of the cool

relative intercombination line shifts may be connected with varying occultation
