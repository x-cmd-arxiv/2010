coupling alpha' > 6 x 10^{-8} alpha to electrons (alpha=e^2/4pi) in the mass
range 65 MeV < m_A' < 550 MeV. New vector bosons with such small couplings
arise naturally from a small kinetic mixing of the ""dark photon"" A' with the
photon -- one of the very few ways in which new forces can couple to the
Standard Model -- and have received considerable attention as an explanation of
various dark matter related anomalies. A' bosons are produced by radiation off
an electron beam, and could appear as narrow resonances with small production
cross-section in the trident e+e- spectrum. We summarize the experimental
approach described in a proposal submitted to Jefferson Laboratory's PAC35,
PR-10-009. This experiment, the A' Experiment (APEX), uses the electron beam of
the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility at Jefferson Laboratory
(CEBAF) at energies of ~1-4 GeV incident on 0.5-10% radiation length Tungsten
wire mesh targets, and measures the resulting e+e- pairs to search for the A'
using the High Resolution Spectrometer and the septum magnet in Hall A. With a
~1 month run, APEX will achieve very good sensitivity because the statistics of
e+e- pairs will be ~10,000 times larger in the explored mass range than any
previous search for the A' boson. These statistics and the excellent mass
resolution of the spectrometers allow sensitivity to alpha'/alpha one to three
orders of magnitude below current limits, in a region of parameter space of
great theoretical and phenomenological interest. Similar experiments could also
be performed at other facilities, such as the Mainz Microtron.

hydrogen pollution in helium white dwarfs typically results from accretion of
large parent bodies rather than interstellar gas as previously supposed, then
H_2O probably constitutes at least 10% of the aggregate mass of extrasolar
minor planets. One observational test of this possibility is to examine the
atmospheres of externally-polluted white dwarfs for oxygen in excess of that
likely contributed by oxides such as SiO_2. The relatively high oxygen
abundance previously reported in GD 378 plausibly but not uniquely can be
explained by accretion of an H_2O-rich parent body or bodies. Future
ultraviolet observations of white dwarf pollutions can serve to investigate the
hypothesis that environments with liquid water that are suitable habitats for

were obtained in the broad band K (2.2 mu) and through narrow band filters at
the wavelengths of H_2 v=1--0 S(1) (2.1218 mu) and Br gamma (2.166 mu) lines.
Fifty regions were imaged with a field of view of 2.2 X 2.2 arcmin^2. Several
young embedded clusters are unveiled in our near-infrared images. 76% of the
objects exhibit H_2 emission and 50% or more of the objects exhibit aligned H_2
emission features suggesting collimated outflows, many of which are new
detections. These observations suggest that disk accretion is probably the
leading mechanism in the formation of stars, at least up to late O spectral
types. The young stellar objects responsible for many of these outflows are
positively identified in our images based on their locations with respect to
the outflow lobes, 2MASS colours and association with MSX, IRAS, millimetre and
radio sources. The close association of molecular outflows detected in CO with
the H_2 emission features produced by shock excitation by jets from the young
stellar objects suggests that the outflows from these objects are jet-driven.
Towards strong radio emitting sources, H_2 jets were either not detected or
were weak when detected, implying that most of the accretion happens in the
pre-UCHII phase; accretion and outflows are probably weak when the YSO has
advanced to its UCHII stage.

universal law. Although many different models have been proposed, no general
theoretical explanation has been shown to exist for its universality. Here we
show that Zipf's law is, in fact, an inevitable outcome of a very general class
of stochastic systems. Borrowing concepts from Algorithmic Information Theory,
our derivation is based on the properties of the symbolic sequence obtained
through successive observations over a system with an unbounded number of
possible states. Specifically, we assume that the complexity of the description
of the system provided by the sequence of observations is the one expected for
a system evolving to a stable state between order and disorder. This result is
obtained from a small set of mild, physically relevant assumptions. The general
nature of our derivation and its model-free basis would explain the ubiquity of
such a law in real systems.

counting. Let $S$ be a set of $n$ disjoint line segments in $\R^2$ and let $s$

quickly determine if $s$ is visible from a query point $q$. Visibility counting
involves preprocessing $S$ so that one can quickly estimate the number of
segments in $S$ visible from a query point $q$.
  We present several data structures for the two query problems. The structures
build upon a result by O'Rourke and Suri (1984) who showed that the subset,
$V_S(s)$, of $\R^2$ that is weakly visible from a segment $s$ can be
represented as the union of a set, $C_S(s)$, of $O(n^2)$ triangles, even though
the complexity of $V_S(s)$ can be $\Omega(n^4)$. We define a variant of their
covering, give efficient output-sensitive algorithms for computing it, and
prove additional properties needed to obtain approximation bounds. Some of our
bounds rely on a new combinatorial result that relates the number of segments
of $S$ visible from a point $p$ to the number of triangles in $\bigcup_{s\in S}
C_S(s)$ that contain $p$.

""play"" to optimize their return on investment. There are many ""targets"" for the
advertisements, and each ""target"" has a collection of games with a potentially
different set of players involved. In this paper, we study the problem of how
advertisers allocate their budget across these ""targets"". In particular, we
focus on formulating their best response strategy as an optimization problem.
Advertisers have a set of keywords (""targets"") and some stochastic information
about the future, namely a probability distribution over scenarios of cost vs
click combinations. This summarizes the potential states of the world assuming
that the strategies of other players are fixed. Then, the best response can be
abstracted as stochastic budget optimization problems to figure out how to
spread a given budget across these keywords to maximize the expected number of
clicks.
  We present the first known non-trivial poly-logarithmic approximation for
these problems as well as the first known hardness results of getting better
than logarithmic approximation ratios in the various parameters involved. We
also identify several special cases of these problems of practical interest,
such as with fixed number of scenarios or with polynomial-sized parameters
related to cost, which are solvable either in polynomial time or with improved
approximation ratios. Stochastic budget optimization with scenarios has
sophisticated technical structure. Our approximation and hardness results come
from relating these problems to a special type of (0/1, bipartite) quadratic
programs inherent in them. Our research answers some open problems raised by
the authors in (Stochastic Models for Budget Optimization in Search-Based
Advertising, Algorithmica, 58 (4), 1022-1044, 2010).

for the condition of $Au+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ AGeV it is shown
a sizable suppression of $v_2$ due to the attractive nature of the field
dynamics that generates the constituent mass. However the key result is that if
$\eta/s$ of the system is kept fixed by an appropriate local renormalization of

this would imply a much lower dark matter density in the core of M4 than would

that cold white dwarves constitute a unique dark matter probe, complementary to

terms of the evolution of Wilson-line operators. In the leading order this
evolution is governed by the non-linear Balitsky- Kovchegov (BK) equation. In
order to see if this equation is relevant for existing or future deep inelastic
scattering (DIS) accelerators (like Electron Ion Collider (EIC) or Large Hadron
electron Collider (LHeC)) one needs to know the next-to-leading order (NLO)
corrections. In addition, the NLO corrections define the scale of the
running-coupling constant in the BK equation and therefore determine the
magnitude of the leading-order cross sections. In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD),
the next-to-leading order BK equation has both conformal and non-conformal
parts. The NLO kernel for the composite operators resolves in a sum of the
conformal part and the running-coupling part. The QCD and ${\cal N}=4$ SYM

phase space in terms of quantities describing the intrinsic and extrinsic

assignment to each triangle of its area, the two unit normals as seen from the
two polyhedra sharing it, and an additional angle related to the extrinsic

the sense that it is locally well-defined, but the local patches lack a
consistent gluing among each other. We give the Poisson brackets among the new

brackets of loop gravity. The new parametrization has the advantage of a simple
description of the gauge-invariant reduced phase space, which is given by a
product of phase spaces associated to edges and vertices, and it also provides
an abelianisation of the SU(2) connection. The results are relevant for the

probabilistic coarse-grained models that simultaneously address the problems of
identifying appropriate reduced coordinates and the effective dynamics in this
lower-dimensional representation. At the core of the models proposed lie
simple, low-dimensional dynamical systems which serve as the building blocks of
the global model. These approximate the latent, generating sources and
parameterize the reduced-order dynamics. We discuss parallelizable, online

a Bayesian adaptive time-integration scheme that utilizes probabilistic
predictive estimates and enables rigorous concurrent s imulation over

late-type stars, and they are presumably generated by a dynamo mechanism at the
interface layer between the radiative and the convective stellar regions. Since
dynamo models are based on the interaction between differential rotation and
convective motions, the introduction of rotation in the ATON 2.3 stellar code
allows for explorations regarding a physically consistent treatment of magnetic
effects in stellar structure and evolution, even though there are formidable
mathematical and numerical challenges involved. As examples, we present
theoretical estimates for both the local (tau_c) and global (tau_g) convective
turnover times for rotating pre-main sequence solar-type stars, based on
up-to-date input physics for stellar models. Our theoretical predictions are
compared with the previous ones available in the literature. In addition, we
investigate the dependence of the convective turnover time on convection
regimes, the presence of rotation and atmospheric treatment. Those estimates,
this quantities can be used to calculate the Rossby number, Ro, which is
related to the magnetic activity strength in dynamo theories and, at least for
main-sequence stars, shows an observational correlation with stellar activity.
More important, they can also contribute for testing stellar models against
observations. Our theoretical values of tau_c, tau_g and Ro qualitatively agree
with those published by Kim & Demarque (1996). By increasing the convection
efficiency, tau_g decreases for a given mass. FST models show still lower
values. The presence of rotation shifts tau_g towards slightly higher values
when compared with non-rotating models. The use of non-gray boundary conditions
in the models yields values of tau_g smaller than in the gray approximation.

evolution of the coronal magnetic field. Here we consider so-called ""hedgerow""
prominences, which consist of thin vertical threads. We explore the possibility
that such prominences are supported by tangled magnetic fields. A variety of
different approaches are used. First, the dynamics of plasma within a tangled
field is considered. We find that the contorted shape of the flux tubes
significantly reduces the flow velocity compared to the supersonic free fall
that would occur in a straight vertical tube. Second, linear force-free models
of tangled fields are developed, and the elastic response of such fields to
gravitational forces is considered. We demonstrate that the prominence plasma
can be supported by the magnetic pressure of a tangled field that pervades not
only the observed dense threads but also their local surroundings. Tangled
fields with field strengths of about 10 G are able to support prominence
threads with observed hydrogen density of the order of 10^(11) cm^(-3).
Finally, we suggest that the observed vertical threads are the result of
Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Simulations of the density distribution within a
prominence thread indicate that the peak density is much larger than the
average density. We conclude that tangled fields provide a viable mechanism for
magnetic support of hedgerow prominences.

of the ensembles is qualitatively different from those of Gaussian and the
critical ensembles. In this work, we make further efforts to characterize the
two-level kernel of the $\lambda$-ensembles and discuss its various properties.
To this end, we first show that the kernel of the $\lambda$-ensembles also
possess an anomalous structure characteristic of the critical ensembles, namely
the ghost correlation peak. We then propose, albeit in a restricted regime, a
form of the two-level kernel which is distinct from the sine kernel of the
Gaussian ensembles as well as the sinh kernel of the critical ensembles. We
test the proposed form numerically and discuss its implications. In particular,
we show that the case $\lambda > 1$ is qualitatively distinct from the case
$\lambda <1$, the latter decribing true fat-tail ensembles.

to the rate of transmission R. We show that for a BMS channel $W$, for $R <

information consumers are minimax (risk-averse) agents, each possessing some

rational in the sense that they actively combine information from the mechanism

certain geometric mechanism is universally optimal for all minimax information
consumers. Additionally, our solution makes it possible to release query
results at multiple levels of privacy in a collusion-resistant manner.

We find a tilt of gamma_z=d(g-z)/dz=-0.0257 +- 0.0050 for the full GC sample of
the Fornax Cluster Survey (~5800 GCs). This is slightly shallower than the
value gamma_z=-0.0459 +- 0.0048 found for the Virgo Cluster Survey GC sample
(~11100 GCs). The slope for the merged Fornax and Virgo datasets (~16900 GCs)
is gamma_z=-0.0293 +- 0.0085, corresponding to a mass-metallicity relation of Z
~ M^0.43. We find that the blue tilt sets in at GC masses in excess of M ~
2*10^5 M_sun. The tilt is stronger for GCs belonging to high-mass galaxies (M_*
> 5 * 10^10 M_sun) than for those in low-mass galaxies (M_* < 5 * 10^10 M_sun).
It is also more pronounced for GCs with smaller galactocentric distances. Our
findings suggest a range of mass-metallicity relations Z_GC ~ M_GC^(0.3-0.7)
which vary as a function of host galaxy mass/luminosity. We compare our
observations to a recent model of star cluster self-enrichment with generally
favorable results. We suggest that, within the context of this model, the
proto-cluster clouds out of which the GCs formed may have had density profiles
slightly steeper than isothermal and/or star formation efficiencies somewhat
below 0.3. We caution, however, that the significantly different appearance of
the CMDs defined by the GC systems associated with galaxies of similar mass and
morphological type pose a challenge to any single mechanism that seeks to
explain the blue tilt. We therefore suggest that the merger/accretion histories
of individual galaxies have played a non-negligible role determining the
distribution of GCs in the CMDs of individual GC systems.

of recent and ongoing merger activity. Through the visual classification of all
galaxies, down to i_vega<22.2 (~27,000 galaxies) over 2 square degrees, we have
compiled the CFHTLS Deep Catalog of Interacting Galaxies, with ~1600 merging
galaxies. We find the merger fraction to be 4.3% +/-0.3% at z~0.3 and 19.0%
+/-2.5% at z~1, implying evolution of the merger fraction going as (1+z)^m,
with m=2.25 +/-0.24. This result is inconsistent with a mild or non-evolving
(m<1.5) scenario at a >4sigma level of confidence. A mild trend, where massive
galaxies with M>10^10.7 M_sun are undergoing fewer mergers than less massive
systems M~10^10 M_sun), consistent with the expectations of galaxy assembly
downsizing is observed. Our results also show that interacting galaxies have on
average SFRs double that found in non-interacting field galaxies. We conclude
that (1) the optical galaxy merger fraction does evolve with redshift, (2) the
merger fraction depends mildly on stellar mass, with lower mass galaxies having
higher merger fractions at z<1, and (3) star formation is triggered at all
phases of a merger, with larger enhancements at later stages, consistent with
N-body simulations.

breakout, presenting the rare opportunity to study a core-collapse SN beginning
with the initial envelope-cooling phase immediately following shock breakout.
We present an extensive sequence of optical and near-infrared spectra, as well
as three epochs of optical spectropolarimetry. Our initial spectra, taken two
days after shock breakout, are dominated by hydrogen Balmer lines at high
velocity. However, by maximum light, He I lines dominated the optical and
near-infrared spectra, which closely resembled those of normal Type Ib
supernovae (SNe Ib) such as SN 1999ex. This spectroscopic transition defines
Type IIb supernovae, but the strong similarity of SN 2008ax to normal SNe Ib
beginning near maximum light, including an absorption feature near 6270A due to
H-alpha at high velocities, suggests that many objects classified as SNe Ib in
the literature may have ejected similar amounts of hydrogen as SN 2008ax,
roughly a few x 0.01 M_sun. Early-time spectropolarimetry (6 and 9 days after
shock breakout) revealed strong line polarization modulations of 3.4% across
H-alpha, indicating the presence of large asphericities in the outer ejecta.
The continuum shares a common polarization angle with the hydrogen, helium, and
oxygen lines, while the calcium and iron absorptions are oriented at different
angles. This is clear evidence of deviations from axisymmetry even in the outer
ejecta. Intrinsic continuum polarization of 0.64% only nine days after shock
breakout shows that the outer layers of the ejecta were quite aspherical. A
single epoch of late-time spectropolarimetry, as well as the shapes of the
nebular line profiles, demonstrate that asphericities extended from the
outermost layers all the way down to the center of this SN. [Abridged]

as the ozone hole. This region has two basic indicators: the area, where the
ozone abundance is low (size), and the quantity of ozone mass deficit (depth).
The energetic particles that penetrate deeply into the atmosphere and galactic
cosmic rays (GCR) modify the ozone abundance in the stratosphere. With this
research project, we are looking for evidence of a connection between
variations in the cosmic ray flux and variations in the size of the ozone hole.
In addition, we are looking for signs of the kind of processes that physically
connect GCR fluxes with variations in the stratospheric ozone hole size (OHS)
in the Antarctic region. With this goal in mind, we also analyze here the
atmospheric temperature (AT) anomalies, which have often been linked with such
variations. Using Morlet's wavelet spectral analysis to compute the coherence
between two time series, we found that during the analyzed period (1982-2005),
there existed a common signal of around 3 and 5 years between the OHS and GCR
time series, during September and November, respectively. In both cases, the
relationship showed a time-dependent anti-correlation between the two series.
On the other hand, for October the analysis showed a time-dependent correlation
that occurs around 1.7 years. These results seem to indicate that there exist
at least two kinds of modulation processes of GCR fluxes on the OHS that work
simultaneously but that change their relative relevance along the timeline.

small projected rotational velocity and modest chromospheric emission, evince
substantial scatter in the linestrengths of 6707 Li I feature that is absent in
the 7699 K I resonance line. The Li I scatter is not correlated with that in
the high-excitation 7774 O I feature, and the magnitude of the former is
greater than the latter despite the larger temperature sensitivity of the O I
feature. These results suggest that systematic errors in linestrength
measurements due to blending, color (or color-based T_eff) errors, or line
formation effects related to an overlying chromosphere are not the principal
source of Li I scatter in our stars. There do exist analytic spot models that
can produce the observed Li scatter without introducing scatter in the K I line
strengths or the color-magnitude diagram. However, these models predict factor
of >3 differences in abundances derived from the subordinate 6104 and resonance
6707 Li I features; we find no difference in the abundances determined from

significantly larger than we observe in our spectra. The simplest explanation
of the Li, K, CN, and photometric data is that there must be a real abundance

large electric dipole moment of polar molecules can be tuned with an external
electric field; this provides unique opportunities such as control of ultracold
chemical reactions, quantum information processing, and the realization of
novel quantum many-body systems. In spite of intense experimental efforts aimed
at observing the influence of dipoles on ultracold molecules, only recently
have sufficiently high densities been achieved. Here, we report the observation
of dipolar collisions in an ultracold molecular gas prepared close to quantum
degeneracy. For modest values of an applied electric field, we observe a
dramatic increase in the loss rate of fermionic KRb molecules due to ultrcold
chemical reactions. We find that the loss rate has a steep power-law dependence
on the induced electric dipole moment, and we show that this dependence can be
understood with a relatively simple model based on quantum threshold laws for
scattering of fermionic polar molecules. We directly observe the spatial
anisotropy of the dipolar interaction as manifested in measurements of the
thermodynamics of the dipolar gas. These results demonstrate how the long-range
dipolar interaction can be used for electric-field control of chemical reaction
rates in an ultracold polar molecule gas. The large loss rates in an applied
electric field suggest that creating a long-lived ensemble of ultracold polar
molecules may require confinement in a two-dimensional trap geometry to
suppress the influence of the attractive dipolar interactions.

with local cohomology of the face ring itself. The enumerative result is
generalized in slightly weaker form to squarefree modules. A concept of
`Cohen-Macaulay in codimension c' is defined and characterized for arbitrary

r-dimensional complex Delta, it is equivalent to nonsingularity of Delta in
dimension r-c; for a coherent sheaf on projective space, this condition is

described using context-free grammars with annotations such as semantic actions
or pretty-printing instructions.
  These descriptions are processed by generators which automatically build
software, e.g., parsers, pretty-printers and editing support.
  In many cases the annotations make grammars unreadable, and when generating
code for several tools supporting the same language, one usually needs to
duplicate the grammar in order to provide different annotations for different
generators.
  We present an approach to describing languages which improves readability of
grammars and reduces the duplication. To achieve this we use Aspect-Oriented
Programming principles. This approach has been implemented in an open-source
tool named Grammatic. We show how it can be used to generate pretty-printers
and syntax highlighters.

harmonic generation, we also demonstrate the enhancement effect exploiting

different reconstruction techniques based on recently improved versions of the
weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, monotonicity preserving
(MP) schemes as well as slope-limited polynomial reconstruction. The proposed
numerical methods are highly accurate in smooth regions of the flow, avoid loss
of accuracy in proximity of smooth extrema and provide sharp non-oscillatory
transitions at discontinuities. We suggest a numerical formulation based on a
cell-centered approach where all of the primary flow variables are discretized
at the zone center. The divergence-free condition is enforced by augmenting the
MHD equations with a generalized Lagrange multiplier yielding a mixed
hyperbolic/parabolic correction, as in Dedner et al. (J. Comput. Phys. 175
(2002) 645-673). The resulting family of schemes is robust, cost-effective and
straightforward to implement. Compared to previous existing approaches, it
completely avoids the CPU intensive workload associated with an elliptic
divergence cleaning step and the additional complexities required by staggered
mesh algorithms. Extensive numerical testing demonstrate the robustness and
reliability of the proposed framework for computations involving both smooth

appearance of a thick accretion disk, which is studied as it enters and remains
in a regime of quasi-steady accretion. Although a simple ideal-fluid equation
of state with \Gamma=2 is used, this work presents a systematic study within a
fully general relativistic framework of the properties of the resulting
black-hole--torus system produced by the merger of unequal-mass binaries. More
specifically, we show that: (1) The mass of the torus increases considerably
with the mass asymmetry and equal-mass binaries do not produce significant tori
if they have a total baryonic mass M_tot >~ 3.7 M_sun; (2) Tori with masses
M_tor ~ 0.2 M_sun are measured for binaries with M_tot ~ 3.4 M_sun and mass
ratios q ~ 0.75-0.85; (3) The mass of the torus can be estimated by the simple
expression M_tor(q, M_tot) = [c_1 (1-q) + c_2](M_max-M_tot), involving the
maximum mass for the binaries and coefficients constrained from the
simulations, and suggesting that the tori can have masses as large as M_tor ~
0.35 M_sun for M_tot ~ 2.8 M_sun and q ~ 0.75-0.85; (4) Using a novel technique
to analyze the evolution of the tori we find no evidence for the onset of
non-axisymmetric instabilities and that very little, if any, of their mass is
unbound; (5) Finally, for all the binaries considered we compute the complete
gravitational waveforms and the recoils imparted to the black holes, discussing
the prospects of detection of these sources for a number of present and future
detectors.
