discover a broken-symmetry metastable phase that exhibits an aperiodic,

by many distinct, nearly degenerate configurations. The activated transitions
between the configurations are mapped onto the dynamics of a long range
classical Heisenberg model with 6-component spins and anisotropic couplings. We
argue the metastable phase corresponds to a deeply supercooled non-polymeric,
non-metallic liquid, and further establish an order parameter for the
glass-to-crystal transition. The spin model itself exhibits a continuous range
of behaviors between two limits corresponding to frozen-in shear and uniform
compression/dilation respectively. The two regimes are separated by a
continuous transition controlled by the anisotropy in the spin-spin
interaction, which is directly related to the Poisson ratio $\sigma$ of the
material. The latter ratio and the ultra-violet cutoff of the theory determine
the liquid configurational entropy. Our results suggest that liquid's fragility
depends on the Poisson ratio in a non-monotonic way. The present ansatz
provides a microscopic framework for computing the configurational entropy and
relaxational spectrum of specific substances.

objective, we first solve the forward problem by implementing the Biot theory
in a reflectivity-type simulation program. We then study the sensitivity of the
seismic response of stratified media to the poroelastic parameters. Our
numerical tests indicate that the porosity and consolidation parameter are the
most sensitive parameters in forward and inverse modeling, whereas the
permeability has only a very limited influence on the seismic response. Next,
the analytical expressions of the sensitivity operators are introduced in a
generalized least-square inversion algorithm based on an iterative modeling of
the seismic waveforms. The application of this inversion procedure to synthetic
data shows that the porosity as well as the fluid and solid parameters can be
correctly reconstructed as long as the other parameters are well known.
However, the strong seismic coupling between some of the model parameters makes
it difficult to fully characterize the medium by a multi-parameter inversion
scheme. One solution to circumvent this difficulty is to combine several model
parameters according to rock physics laws to invert for composite parameters.
Another possibility is to invert the seismic data for the perturbations of the
medium properties, such as those resulting from a gas injection.

function of the aspect ratio and amount of compression. We find that the
behavior near jamming is significantly different for ellipses and dimers even
though both shapes are roughly characterized by the aspect ratio and possess
the same number of translational and rotational degrees of freedom per
particle. For example, we find that ellipse packings are hypostatic (not
isostatic as found for dimers), display novel power-law scaling of the static
linear shear modulus and contact number with the amount of compression, and
possess stress-strain relations that are qualitatively different from that for
dimers. Thus, we observe that important macroscopic properties of static
packings of anisotropic particles can depend on the microscale geometrical
features of individual particles.

(anti)neutrino tomography. Antineutrinos emitted from reactors are used as a
probe. As the antineutrinos traverse through a region prone to earthquakes,
observable variations in the matter effect on the antineutrino oscillation
would provide a tomography of the vicinity of the region. In this preliminary
work, we adopt a simplified model for the geometrical profile and matter
density in a fault zone. We calculate the survival probability of electron
antineutrinos for cases without and with an anomalous accumulation of electrons
which can be considered as a clear signal of the coming earthquake, at the
geological region with a fault zone, and find that the variation may reach as
much as 3% for $\bar \nu_e$ emitted from a reactor. The case for a $\nu_e$ beam
from a neutrino factory is also investigated, and it is noted that, because of
the typically high energy associated with such neutrinos, the oscillation
length is too large and the resultant variation is not practically observable.
Our conclusion is that with the present reactor facilities and detection
techniques, it is still a difficult task to make an earthquake forecast using
such a scheme, though it seems to be possible from a theoretical point of view
while ignoring some uncertainties. However, with the development of the
geology, especially the knowledge about the fault zone, and with the
improvement of the detection techniques, etc., there is hope that a medium-term
earthquake forecast would be feasible.

optical polarization-dependent Magnus effect which is significantly different
from the conventional optical Magnus effect in that light-matter interaction is
not required. Further, we reveal the relation between transverse-momentum
currents and the optical Magnus effect, and find that such a
polarization-dependent rotation is unavoidable when the wave packet possesses
transverse-momentum currents. The physics underlying this intriguing effect is
the combined contributions of transverse spin and orbital currents. We predict
that this effect may be observed experimentally even in the propagation
direction. These findings provide further evidence for the optical Magnus
effect in free space and can be extrapolated to other physical systems.

studies of their properties in the case of a substantial water layer. This work
considers such water planets with a range of masses and water mass fractions (2
to 5 M_Earth, 0.02% to 50% H2 O). First, we model the thermal and dynamical
structure of the near-surface for icy and oceanic surfaces, finding separate
regimes where the planet is expected to maintain a subsurface liquid ocean and
where it is expected to exhibit ice tectonics. Newly discovered exoplanets may
be placed into one of these regimes given estimates of surface temperature,
heat flux, and gravity. Second, we construct a parameterized convection model
for the underlying ice mantle of higher ice phases, finding that materials
released from the silicate iron core should traverse the ice mantle on the
timescale of 0.1 to 100 megayears. We present the dependence of the overturn
times of the ice mantle and the planetary radius on total mass and water mass
fraction. Finally, we discuss the implications of these internal processes on
atmospheric observables.

  k-Subgraph","23 pages",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the Densest k-Subgraph problem, given a graph G and a parameter k, one
needs to find a subgraph of G induced on k vertices that contains the largest
number of edges. There is a significant gap between the best known upper and
lower bounds for this problem. It is NP-hard, and does not have a PTAS unless
NP has subexponential time algorithms. On the other hand, the current best
known algorithm of Feige, Kortsarz and Peleg, gives an approximation ratio of
n^(1/3-epsilon) for some specific epsilon > 0 (estimated at around 1/60).
  We present an algorithm that for every epsilon > 0 approximates the Densest
k-Subgraph problem within a ratio of n^(1/4+epsilon) in time n^O(1/epsilon). In
particular, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of O(n^1/4) in time
n^O(log n). Our algorithm is inspired by studying an average-case version of
the problem where the goal is to distinguish random graphs from graphs with
planted dense subgraphs. The approximation ratio we achieve for the general
case matches the distinguishing ratio we obtain for this planted problem.
  At a high level, our algorithms involve cleverly counting appropriately
defined trees of constant size in G, and using these counts to identify the
vertices of the dense subgraph. Our algorithm is based on the following
principle. We say that a graph G(V,E) has log-density alpha if its average
degree is Theta(|V|^alpha). The algorithmic core of our result is a family of
algorithms that output k-subgraphs of nontrivial density whenever the
log-density of the densest k-subgraph is larger than the log-density of the
host graph.

  IEEE Transactions on Information Theory with a different title, which is
  available in arXiv:1202.0204",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce the Causal Cognitive Interference Channel With
Delay (CC-IFC-WD) in which the cognitive user transmission can depend on $L$
future received symbols as well as the past ones. Taking the effect of the link
delays into account, CC-IFC-WD fills the gap between the genie-aided and causal
1cognitive radio channels. We study three special cases: 1) Classical CC-IFC
(L=0), 2) CC-IFC without delay (L=1) and 3) CC-IFC with a block length delay
(L=n). In each case, we obtain an inner bound on the capacity region. Our
coding schemes make use of cooperative strategy by generalized block Markov
superposition coding, collaborative strategy by rate splitting, and
Gel'fand-Pinsker coding in order to pre-cancel part of the interference.
Moreover, instantaneous relaying and non-causal partial Decode-and-Forward
strategies are employed in the second and third cases, respectively. The
derived regions under special conditions, reduce to several previously known
results. Moreover, we show that the coding strategy which we use to derive
achievable rate region for the classical CC-IFC achieves capacity for a special
case of this channel. Furthermore, we extend our achievable rate regions to
Gaussian case. Providing a numerical example for Gaussian CC-IFC-WD, we
investigate the rate gain of the cognitive link for different delay values.

interaction and anisotropy energies of a pair of substitutional Mn atoms in
GaAs as a function of their separation distance and direction. We find that the
most energetically stable configuration is usually one in which the spins are
ferromagnetically aligned along the vector connecting the Mn atoms. The
ferromagnetic configuration is characterized by a splitting of the topmost
unoccupied acceptor levels, which is visible in scanning tunneling microscope
studies when the pair is close to the surface and is strongly dependent on pair
orientation. The largest acceptor splittings occur when the Mn pair is oriented
along the <110> symmetry direction, and the smallest when they are oriented
along <100>. We show explicitly that the acceptor splitting is not simply
related to the effective exchange interaction between the Mn local moments. The
exchange interaction constant is instead more directly related to the width of
the distribution of all impurity levels -- occupied and unoccupied. When the Mn
pair is at the (110) GaAs surface, both acceptor splitting and effective
exchange interaction are very small except for the smallest possible Mn
separation.

The derivation of such bounds involves only simple probabilistic and analytic
tools. This complements the asymptotic expansions of Knessl (1998), Jacquet and
Szpankowski (1999), and Flajolet (1999). The same method yields tight bounds on
the relative entropy D(n, p) between a binomial and a Poisson, thus refining
the work of Harremoes and Ruzankin (2004). Bounds on the entropy of the
binomial also follow easily.

known that there exists a corresponding deterministic network called the
discrete superposition network that approximates its capacity uniformly over
all SNR's to within a bounded number of bits. The next step in this program of
rigorous approximation is to determine whether coding schemes for discrete
superposition models can be lifted to Gaussian relay networks with a bounded
rate loss independent of SNR. We establish precisely this property and show
that the superposition model can thus serve as a strong surrogate for designing
codes for Gaussian relay networks.
  We show that a code for a Gaussian relay network, with a single
source-destination pair and multiple relay nodes, can be designed from any code
for the corresponding discrete superposition network simply by pruning it. In
comparison to the rate of the discrete superposition network's code, the rate
of the Gaussian network's code only reduces at most by a constant that is a
function only of the number of nodes in the network and independent of channel
gains.
  This result is also applicable for coding schemes for MIMO Gaussian relay
networks, with the reduction depending additionally on the number of antennas.
  Hence, the discrete superposition model can serve as a digital interface for
operating Gaussian relay networks.
