inflationary universes in terms of a three-dimensional quantum field theory.
The holographic description correctly reproduces standard inflationary
predictions in their regime of applicability. In the opposite case, wherein
gravity is strongly coupled at early times, we propose a holographic
description in terms of perturbative QFT and present models capable of
satisfying the current observational constraints while exhibiting a
phenomenology distinct from standard inflation. This provides a qualitatively
new method for generating a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of primordial
cosmological perturbations.

theory perspective; extensive research has shown that these functions, if
nonconstant, must have high `complexity' according to various measures.
  In recent work of this type, Sun gave bounds on the block sensitivity of
nonconstant Boolean functions invariant under a transitive permutation group.
Sun showed that all such functions satisfy bs(f) = Omega(N^{1/3}), and that
there exists such a function for which bs(f) = O(N^{3/7}ln N). His example
function belongs to a subclass of transitively invariant functions called the
minterm-transitive functions (defined in earlier work by Chakraborty).
  We extend these results in two ways. First, we show that nonconstant
minterm-transitive functions satisfy bs(f) = Omega(N^{3/7}). Thus Sun's example
function has nearly minimal block sensitivity for this subclass. Second, we
give an improved example: a minterm-transitive function for which bs(f) =
O(N^{3/7}ln^{1/7}N).

within the standard LCDM framework, of the photometric properties of the
progenitors of present-day early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0<z<1. We
explore progenitors of all morphologies and study their characteristics as a
function of the luminosity and local environment of the early-type remnant at
z=0. In agreement with previous studies, we find that, while larger early-types
are generally assembled later, their luminosity-weighted stellar ages are
typically older. In dense cluster-like environments, 70% of early-type systems
are `in place' by z=1 and evolve without interactions thereafter, while in the
field the corresponding value is 30%. Averaging across all environments at z~1,
less than 50% of the stellar mass which ends up in early-types today is
actually in early-type progenitors at this redshift, in agreement with recent
observational work. We develop probabilistic prescriptions which provide a
means of including spiral (i.e. non early-type) progenitors at intermediate and
high redshifts, based on their luminosity and optical colours. For example, we
find that, at intermediate redshifts (z~0.5), large (M_V<-21.5), red (B-V>0.7)
spirals have 75-95% chance of being an early-type progenitor, while the
corresponding probability for large blue spirals (M_B<-21.5, B-V<0.7) is
50-75%. The prescriptions developed here can be used to address, from the
perspective of the standard model, the issue of `progenitor bias', whereby the
exclusion of late-type progenitors in observational studies can lead to
inaccurate conclusions regarding the evolution of the early-type population
over cosmic time. (abridged)

and why it is so hard to build one. Among the first applications anticipated to
bear fruit is quantum simulation of quantum systems. While most quantum
computation is an extension of classical digital computation, quantum
simulation differs fundamentally in how the data is encoded in the quantum
computer. To perform a quantum simulation, the Hilbert space of the system to
be simulated is mapped directly onto the Hilbert space of the (logical) qubits
in the quantum computer. This type of direct correspondence is how data is
encoded in a classical analogue computer. There is no binary encoding, and
increasing precision becomes exponentially costly: an extra bit of precision
doubles the size of the computer. This has important consequences for both the
precision and error correction requirements of quantum simulation, and
significant open questions remain about its practicality. It also means that
the quantum version of analogue computers, continuous variable quantum
computers (CVQC) becomes an equally efficient architecture for quantum
simulation. Lessons from past use of classical analogue computers can help us
to build better quantum simulators in future.

magnetoelectric coupling strongly renormalizes the magnetic transition
temperature, $T_M\to T_{RM}$ (with $T_{RM}>>T_M$), as well as generates an
additional anomaly in ferroelectric subsystem $T_{RM}$. Full susceptibility

was investigated using first principles density functional calculations within
the local density approximation. These materials have both $A$-site size
disorder and ions with sterochemical activity. We found a strong ferroelectric
distortion in both materials. The polarization of the Pb material is $>$80
$\mu$C/cm$^2$ along the rhombohedral direction and the Sr based material is
only slightly inferior. The high polarization results mainly from a large
off-centering of Bi and the large Born effective charge of Nb, which yields a
large contribution polarization although the Nb off-centers by a smaller
amount. Neither of these materials favors a tetragonal state, and therefore
solid solutions with PbTiO$_3$ may show morphotoropic phase boundaries.

low z are almost invariably located in clusters of galaxies. We use the most
accurate photometric redshifts available to date, derived by the COSMOS

three-dimensional space over-densities around our objects. Three out of the

significant at the 4-sigma level, compared to field counts, arguing for the

We use the IAC-pop/MinnIAC algorithm to derive the recent star formation
history in three fields in the bulge and disk of NGC 5102. In the disk fields,
the recent star formation rate has declined monotonically and is now barely
detectable, but a starburst is still in progress in the bulge and has added
about 2 percent to the mass of the bulge over the last 200 Myr. Other studies
of star formation in NGC 5102 indicate that about 20 percent of its stellar
mass was added over the past Gyr. If this is correct, then much of the stellar
mass of the bulge may have formed over this period. It seems likely that this
star formation was fueled by the accretion of a gas-rich system with HI mass of
about 2 x 10^9 Msol which has now been almost completely converted into stars.
The large mass of recently formed stars and the blue colours of the bulge
suggest that the current starburst, which is now fading, may have made a
significant contribution to build the bulge of NGC 5102.

namely for medical and astronomical applications. However, the restoration of
these images using state-of-the-art regularizers (such as those based on
multiscale representations or total variation) is still an active research
area, since the associated optimization problems are quite challenging. In this
paper, we propose an approach to deconvolving Poissonian images, which is based
on an alternating direction optimization method. The standard regularization
(or maximum a posteriori) restoration criterion, which combines the Poisson
log-likelihood with a (non-smooth) convex regularizer (log-prior), leads to
hard optimization problems: the log-likelihood is non-quadratic and
non-separable, the regularizer is non-smooth, and there is a non-negativity
constraint. Using standard convex analysis tools, we present sufficient
conditions for existence and uniqueness of solutions of these optimization
problems, for several types of regularizers: total-variation, frame-based
analysis, and frame-based synthesis. We attack these problems with an instance
of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which belongs to the
family of augmented Lagrangian algorithms. We study sufficient conditions for
convergence and show that these are satisfied, either under total-variation or
frame-based (analysis and synthesis) regularization. The resulting algorithms
are shown to outperform alternative state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of

widely in wireless communication systems. OFDM is very effective in combating
intersymbol interference and can achieve high data rate in frequency selective
channel. For OFDM communication systems, the frequency offsets in mobile radio
channels distort the orthogonality between subcarriers resulting in Inter
Carrier Interference (ICI). ICI causes power leakage among subcarriers thus
degrading the system performance. A wellknown problem of OFDM is its
sensitivity to frequency offset between the transmitted and received carrier
frequencies. There are two deleterious effects caused by frequency offset one
is the reduction of signal amplitude in the output of the filters matched to
each of the carriers and the second is introduction of ICI from the other
carriers. This research work investigates three effective methods for combating
the effects of ICI: ICI Self Cancellation (SC), Maximum Likelihood (ML)
estimation, and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) method. These three methods are
compared in terms of bit error rate performance and bandwidth efficiency.
Through simulations, it is shown that the three techniques are effective in
mitigating the modulation schemes, the ML and EKF methods perform better than
the SC method.

intermittent flows. Various flow patterns are produced by different groupings
of the nodes, based on their random alternation between two possible states.
The resulting flows on the lattices decrease with the number of groups
according to a power law. By Monte Carlo simulations we reveal how the time
span until the occurrence of a splitting depends on the flow patterns.
Increasing the flow fluctuation frequency shortens this time span which reaches
a minimum before rising again due to inertia effects incorporated in the model.
The size of the largest connected component after the splitting is rather
independent of the flow fluctuation frequency but slightly decreases with the
link capacities. Our findings carry important implications for real-world
networks, such as electric power grids with a large share of renewable
intermittent energy sources.

useful concept in theoretical physics since it can permit the comprehension of
difficult systems in physics with an arbitrary choice of a reference frame at
every instant of time. It is always desirable to have a bridge between gauge
invariant and noninvariant theories. Once established, this kind of mapping
between first-class (gauge invariant) and second-class systems, in Dirac's
formalism can be considered as a sort of duality. In this paper we investigate
this ""duality"" obtaining a gauge invariant theory starting with a noninvariant
one. We analyzed both Abelian and non-Abelian theories and the procedure used
is the recent dual (also called symplectic) embedding formalism. We believe
that this method is the most convenient one since it is not plagued by the
ambiguity problems that torments BFFT and other iterative methods. We
demonstrated exactly that this ""dualization"" method used here does not require
any special modification to handle with non-Abelian systems, which is also a
new result described in this paper. To prove the gauge invariance we used just
the Dirac constraint technique. It is relevant to say here that, although this
work is lengthy, the majority of the results presented here are new in the
literature. The results that are not new were reproduced within a new

vacancies on the structure of 180^o ferroelectric domain walls in PbTiO_3. It
is known that oxygen vacancies move to the domain walls and pin them. Hence, we
assume a periodic arrangement of oxygen vacancies on both Pb-centered and
Ti-centered domain walls in PbTiO_3. We use a semi-analytic anharmonic lattice
statics method for obtaining the relaxed configurations using a shell
potential. In agreement with recent ab initio calculations, we observe that a
Pb-centered domain wall with oxygen vacancies is not stable even under strain.
Our semi-analytic calculations for PbTiO_3 show that oxygen vacancies affect
the structure of 180^o domain walls significantly but do not have a
considerable effect on the thickness of domain walls; they broaden the domain
walls by about fifty percent. We also study the effect of normal and shear
strains on both perfect and defective 180^o domain walls. We observe that
normal and shear strains affect the structure but do not change the domain wall
thickness.

types from F to G for the secondary although there is a large excess over that
from the secondary at the infrared wavelengths. This may be due to emission
from the cooler outer regions of the accretion disk. We cannot rule out a brown

Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) of the ALICE experiment. Three different methods
to study the collected charge as a function of the drift time have been
implemented. The first approach consists in measuring the charge at different
injection distances moving an infrared laser by means of micrometric step
motors. The second method is based on the measurement of the charge injected by
the laser at fixed drift distance and varying the drift field, thus changing
the drift time. In the last method, the measurement of the charge deposited by
atmospheric muons is used to study the charge collection efficiency as a
function of the drift time. The three methods gave consistent results and
indicated that no charge loss during the drift is observed for the sensor types
used in 99% of the SDD modules mounted on the ALICE Inner Tracking System. The
atmospheric muons have also been used to test the effect of the
zero-suppression applied to reduce the data size by erasing the counts in cells
not passing the thresholds for noise removal. As expected, the zero suppression
introduces a dependence of the reconstructed charge as a function of drift time
because it cuts the signal in the tails of the electron clouds enlarged by
diffusion effects. These measurements allowed also to validate the correction
for this effect extracted from detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the detector
response and applied in the offline data reconstruction.

algorithm, we compute the cross-section of giant arcs from clusters simulated
with dark-matter only physics (DM), dark matter plus gas with cooling and star
formation (CSF), and dark matter plus gas with cooling, star formation and AGN
feedback (CSFBH). Once AGN feedback is included, baryonic physics boosts the
strong lensing cross-section by much less than previously estimated using
clusters simulated with only cooling and star formation. For a cluster with a
virial mass of 7.4 X 10^14 Msol, inclusion of baryonic physics without feedback
can boost the cross-section by as much as a factor of 3, in agreement with
previous studies, whereas once AGN feedback is included this maximal figure
falls to a factor of 2 at most. Typically, clusters simulated with DM and CSFBH
physics have similar cross-sections for the production of giant arcs. We also
investigate how baryonic physics affects the weak lensing properties of the
simulated clusters by fitting NFW profiles to synthetic weak lensing data sets
using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, and by performing non-parametric
mass reconstructions. Without the inclusion of AGN feedback, measured
concentration parameters can be much larger than those obtained with AGN
feedback, which are similar to the dark-matter only case.

K-theory in the setting of small stable infinity categories. Specifically, we
prove that connective algebraic K-theory is the universal additive invariant,
i.e., the universal functor with values in spectra which inverts Morita
equivalences, preserves filtered colimits, and satisfies Waldhausen's
additivity theorem. Similarly, we prove that non-connective algebraic K-theory
is the universal localizing invariant, i.e., the universal functor that
moreover satisfies the ""Thomason-Trobaugh-Neeman"" localization theorem.
  To prove these results, we construct and study two stable infinity categories
of ""noncommutative motives""; one associated to additivity and another to
localization. In these stable infinity categories, Waldhausen's S. construction
corresponds to the suspension functor and connective and non-connective
algebraic K-theory spectra become corepresentable by the noncommutative motive
of the sphere spectrum. In particular, the algebraic K-theory of every scheme,
stack, and ring spectrum can be recovered from these categories of
noncommutative motives.
  In order to work with these categories of noncommutative motives, we
establish comparison theorems between the category of spectral categories
localized at the Morita equivalences and the category of small
idempotent-complete stable infinity categories. We also explain in detail the
comparison between the infinity categorical version of Waldhausen K-theory and
the classical definition.
  As an application of our theory, we obtain a complete classification of the
natural transformations from higher algebraic K-theory to topological
Hochschild homology (THH) and topological cyclic homology (TC). Notably, we
obtain an elegant conceptual description of the cyclotomic trace map.

tests, particularly Kuiper's variant, which focus on discrepancies between the
cumulative distribution function for the specified probability density and the
empirical cumulative distribution function for the given set of i.i.d. draws.
Unfortunately, variations in the probability density function often get
smoothed over in the cumulative distribution function, making it difficult to
detect discrepancies in regions where the probability density is small in
comparison with its values in surrounding regions. We discuss tests without
this deficiency, complementing the classical methods. The tests of the present
paper are based on the plain fact that it is unlikely to draw a random number
whose probability is small, provided that the draw is taken from the same
distribution used in calculating the probability (thus, if we draw a random
number whose probability is small, then we can be confident that we did not

GHz detections unambiguously indicate for the first time that the emission is
maser emission. The 36 GHz methanol masers are not co-spatial with 1720 MHz OH
masers, indicating that the two species trace different shocks. The 36 GHz and
44 GHz methanol masers, which both are collisionally pumped, do not necessarily
co-exist and may trace different methanol gas. The methanol masers seem
correlated with NH_3(3,3) density peaks. We favor an explanation in which the
36 GHz Class I methanol masers outline regions of cloud-cloud collisions,
perhaps just before the onset of the formation of individual massive stars.

generates posterior bit-level soft estimates while taking into account the
effect of phase noise. The algorithm also provides an estimate of the phase
noise sequence. Using this SISO algorithm, a turbo receiver is designed by
passing soft information between the SISO detector and an outer forward error
correcting (FEC) decoder that uses a soft decoding algorithm. It is shown that
the turbo receiver achieves close to optimal performance.

numerical relativity to more general space-times than those investigated

Specifically, we present a modified moving puncture gauge which facilitates
long term stable simulations in D=5. We further demonstrate the internal
consistency of the code by studying convergence and comparing numerical versus

disc components separately. In particular, the effects of dust in galaxies
hosting pseudo-bulges might be different from those in galaxies hosting
classical bulges, even if their dust content is identical. Confirming previous
results, we find that disc scale lengths are overestimated when dust effects
are important. In addition, we also find that bulge effective radii and Sersic
indices are underestimated. Furthermore, the apparent attenuation of the
integrated disc light is underestimated, whereas the corresponding attenuation
of bulge light is overestimated. Dust effects are more significant for the
bulge parameters, and, combined, they lead to a strong underestimation of the
bulge-to-disc ratio, which can reach a factor of two in the V band, even at
relatively low galaxy inclinations and dust opacities. Nevertheless, it never
reaches factors larger than about three, which corresponds to a factor of two
in bulge-to-total ratio. Such effect can have an impact on studies of the black

in the cluster core for galaxies on highly elliptical orbits, but may also
imply that the environmental effects due to the cluster are directly affecting
galaxies on their first infall. To explore these issues, we investigate
different models of ram pressure stripping as it acts on satellite galaxies in

clusters, and use this as the radius of onset of ram pressure stripping in the
GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. Comparison of the results of
our model, and previously considered, simpler ram pressure models, with recent
observations indicates that current data is unable to strongly discriminate
between models of ram pressure stripping due to the complex interplay of
preprocessing effects at work. However, future observations of a larger sample

ram pressure stripping and its role in shaping radial trends in and around

dibaryons - topologically stable D-branes wrapping non-contractible cycles in

systematic and detailed construction of the spectrum of small fluctuations

DR6 with complementary photometric observations by GALEX, 2MASS and IRAS at
far-ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths. We use a recent, simple but
physically motivated model to interpret the observed spectral energy
distributions of the galaxies in this sample in terms of statistical
constraints on physical parameters describing the star formation history and
dust content. The focus on a subsample of 1658 galaxies with highest S/N
observations enables us to investigate most clearly several strong correlations
between various derived physical properties of galaxies. We find that the
typical dust mass of a star-forming correlates remarkably well with the star
formation rate (SFR). We also find that the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, the
ratio of dust mass to star formation rate and the fraction of dust luminosity
contributed by the diffuse interstellar medium all correlate strongly with
specific SFR. A comparison with recent models of chemical and dust evolution of
galaxies suggests that these correlations could arise, at least in part, from
an evolutionary sequence. As galaxies form stars, their ISM becomes enriched in
dust, while the drop in gas supply makes the specific SFR decrease.
Interestingly, as a result, a young, actively star-forming galaxy with low
dust-to-gas ratio may still be highly dusty because it contains large amounts
of interstellar gas. This may be important for the interpretation of the
infrared emission from young, gas-rich star-forming galaxies at high redshift.
Our study provides a useful local reference for future statistical studies of
the star formation and dust properties of galaxies at high redshifts.

explore how closely Q rho/sigma^3, a surrogate measure of the phase-space

considering, in addition to spherically-averaged profiles, local Q-estimates
for individual particles, Q_i; profiles based on the ellipsoidal radius
dictated by the triaxial structure of the halo, Q_i(r'); and by carefully
removing substructures in order to focus on the profile of the smooth halo,
Q^s. The resulting Q_i^s(r') profiles follow closely a power law near the
center, but show a clear upturn from this trend near the virial radius,
r_{200}. The location and magnitude of the deviations are in excellent
agreement with the predictions from Bertschinger's spherical secondary-infall
similarity solution. In this model, Q \propto r^{-1.875} in the inner,
virialized regions, but departures from a power-law occur near r_{200} because
of the proximity of this radius to the location of the first shell crossing -
the shock radius in the case of a collisional fluid. Particles there have not
yet fully virialized, and so Q departs from the inner power-law profile. Our
results imply that the power-law nature of $Q$ profiles only applies to the
inner regions and cannot be used to predict accurately the structure of CDM
halos beyond their characteristic scale radius.

resolution UVES/VLT data of 77 QSOs in the redshift range 0.6 < z < 2.0, and
down to an equivalent width W_0 > 0.1 \AA. The statistical properties of our
sample are found to be in agreement with those from previous work in the
literature. However, we point out that the previously observed increase with
redshift of dN/dz for weak absorbers, pertains exclusively to very weak
absorbers with W_0 < 0.1 \AA. Instead, dN/dz for absorbers with W_0 in the
range 0.1-0.3 \AA actually decreases with redshift, similarly to the case of
strong absorbers. We then use this catalogue to extend our earlier analysis of
the links between the Faraday Rotation Measure of the quasars and the presence
of intervening MgII absorbing systems in their spectra. In contrast to the case
with strong MgII absorption systems W_0 > 0.3 \AA, the weaker systems do not
contribute significantly to the observed Rotation Measure of the background
quasars. This is possibly due to the higher impact parameters of the weak
systems compared to strong ones, suggesting that the high column density
magnetized material that is responsible for the Faraday Rotation is located
within about 50 kpc of the galaxies. Finally, we show that this result also
rules out the possibility that some unexpected secondary correlation between
the quasar redshift and its intrinsic Rotation Measure is responsible for the
association of high Rotation Measure and strong intervening MgII absorption
that we have presented elsewhere, since this would have produced an equal

this implies decreasing marginal returns in the amount of collected

second approach focuses on how users assess the qualities of the individual

band-filtered, configuration space statistic that is easily implemented and has
advantages over the traditional power spectrum and correlation function
estimators. Unlike these estimators, omega_l can localize most of the acoustic
information into a single dip at the acoustic scale while also avoiding
sensitivity to the poorly constrained large scale power (i.e., the integral
constraint) through the use of a localized and compensated filter. It is also
sensitive to anisotropic clustering through pair counting and does not require
any binning. We measure the shift in the acoustic peak due to nonlinear effects
using the monopole omega_0 derived from subsampled dark matter catalogues as
well as from mock galaxy catalogues created via halo occupation distribution
(HOD) modeling. All of these are drawn from 44 realizations of 1024^3 particle
dark matter simulations in a 1h^{-1}Gpc box at z=1. We compare these shifts
with those obtained from the power spectrum and conclude that the results
agree. This indicates that any distance measurements obtained from omega_0 and

extract the same amount of acoustic information using either omega_0 or P(k)

galaxy shapes accurate to <1 part in 1000. We investigate measurement biases,
noted by Voigt and Bridle (2009) and Melchior et al. (2009), that are common to
shape measurement methodologies that rely upon fitting elliptical-isophote
galaxy models to observed data. The first bias arises when the true galaxy
shapes do not match the models being fit. We show that this ""underfitting bias""
is due, at root, to these methods' attempts to use information at high spatial
frequencies that has been destroyed by the convolution with the point-spread
function (PSF) and/or by sampling. We propose a new shape-measurement technique
that is explicitly confined to observable regions of k-space. A second bias
arises for galaxies whose ellipticity varies with radius. For most
shape-measurement methods, such galaxies are subject to ""ellipticity gradient
bias"". We show how to reduce such biases by factors of 20--100 within the new
shape-measurement method. The resulting shear estimator has multiplicative
errors <1 part in 1000 for high-S/N images, even for highly asymmetric
galaxies. Without any training or recalibration, the new method obtains Q=3000
in the GREAT08 Challenge of blind shear reconstruction on low-noise galaxies,
several times better than any previous method.

The proposed protocol adopts Network-level cooperation in contrast to the
traditional physical layer cooperative protocols and in addition uses random
linear network coding at the relay node. The traffic is assumed to be bursty
and the relay node forwards its packets during the periods of source silence
which allows better utilization for channel resources. Our results show that
cooperation will lead to higher stable throughput rates than conventional

the average response of a nonlinear chaotic system with forcing and dissipation

prediction, although suffers from numerical instability for long response times
due to positive Lyapunov exponents. However, in the case of stochastically
driven dynamics, one typically resorts to the classical fluctuation-dissipation
formula, which has the drawback of explicitly requiring the probability density
of the statistical state together with its derivative for computation, which
might not be available with sufficient precision in the case of complex
dynamics (usually a Gaussian approximation is used). Here we adapt the
short-time linear response formula for stochastically driven dynamics, and
observe that, for short and moderate response times before numerical
instability develops, it is generally superior to the classical formula with
Gaussian approximation for both the additive and multiplicative stochastic
forcing. Additionally, a suitable blending with classical formula for longer
response times eliminates numerical instability and provides an improved
response prediction even for long response times.

The turbulent flow field is divided into an outer and an inner region. The
inner region is made up of a log-law region and a wall layer. The wall layer is
viewed in terms of the well known inrush-sweep-burst sequence observed since
1967. It is modelled as a transient laminar sub-boundary layer, which obeys the
Stokes solution for an impulsively started flat plate. The wall layer may also
be modelled with a steady state solution by adding a damping function to the
log-law.
  Closure is achieved by matching the unsteady and steady state solutions at
the edge of the wall layer. This procedure in effect feeds information about
the transient coherent structures back into the time-averaged solution and
determines theoretically the numerical coefficient of the logarithmic law of
the wall
  The method gives a new technique for writing accurate wall functions, valid
for all Reynolds numbers, in computer fluid dynamics (CFD) programmes.

The bright points are not uniformly distributed over the umbra but
preferentially located around the penumbral boundary and in the fast decaying
parts of umbra. The color temperature of the bright points, derived using the
continuum irradiance, are in the range of 4600 K to 6600 K with cooler ones
located in the umbra. The temperature increases as a function of distance from

bright TeV gamma-ray sources without a strong X-ray counterpart. In this paper,
we study the spectral evolution of PWNe taking into account the energy which
was injected when they were young for old PWNe. We model the evolution of the
magnetic field and solve for the particle distribution inside a uniformly
expanding PWN. The model is calibrated by fitting the calculated spectrum to
the observations of the Crab Nebula at an age of a thousand years. We find that
only a small fraction of the injected energy from the Crab Pulsar goes to the
magnetic field, consistent with previous studies. The spectral evolution model
of the Crab Nebula shows that the flux ratio of TeV gamma-rays to X-rays
increases with time, which implies that old PWNe are faint at X-rays, but not
at TeV gamma-rays. The increase of this ratio is primarily because the magnetic
field decreases with time and is not because the X-ray emitting particles are
cooled more rapidly than the TeV gamma-ray emitting particles. Our spectral
evolution model matches the observed rate of the radio flux decrease of the
Crab Nebula.

about the anomaly puzzle in supersymmetric theories. In particular, we consider
a general N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The anomaly puzzle concerns the
question of whether there is a consistent way to put the R-current and the
stress tensor in a single supercurrent, even though in the classical theory
they are in the same supermultiplet. As is well known, the classically
conserved supercurrent bifurcates into two supercurrents having different
anomalies in the quantum regime. The most interesting result we obtain is an
explicit expression for the lowest component of one of the two supercurrents in
4-dimensional spacetime, namely the supercurrent that has the energy-momentum
tensor as one of its components. This expression for the lowest component is an
energy-dependent linear combination of two chiral currents, which itself does
not correspond to a classically conserved chiral current. The lowest component
of the other supercurrent, namely, the R-current, satisfies the Adler-Bardeen
theorem. The lowest component of the first supercurrent has an anomaly that we
show is consistent with the anomaly of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor.
Therefore, we conclude that there is no consistent way to put the R-current and
the stress tensor in a single supercurrent in the quantized theory. We also
discuss and try to clarify some technical points in the derivations of the
two-supercurrents in the literature. These latter points concern the
significance of infrared contributions to the NSVZ beta-function and the role
of the equations of motion in deriving the two supercurrents.

accretion onto the central protostar. The C18O emission shows a compact (~ 1500

the protostellar envelope around B335. The envelope exhibits a velocity
gradient from the east (blueshifted) to west (redshifted) that can be

potential, it brings significant difficulties in mathematical analysis and
numerical simulations of dipolar BECs. In this paper, by decoupling the
two-body dipolar interaction potential into short-range (or local) and
long-range interactions (or repulsive and attractive interactions), the GPE for
dipolar BECs is reformulated as a Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson type system. Based

uniqueness as well as nonexistence of the ground states, and discuss the
existence of global weak solution and finite time blowup of the dynamics in
different parameter regimes of dipolar BECs. In addition, a backward Euler sine
pseudospectral method is presented for computing the ground states and a
time-splitting sine pseudospectral method is proposed for computing the
dynamics of dipolar BECs. Due to the adaption of new mathematical formulation,
our new numerical methods avoid evaluating integrals with high singularity and

  Signals",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Low-complexity near-optimal detection of large-MIMO signals has attracted
recent research. Recently, we proposed a local neighborhood search algorithm,
namely `reactive tabu search' (RTS) algorithm, as well as a factor-graph based
`belief propagation' (BP) algorithm for low-complexity large-MIMO detection.
The motivation for the present work arises from the following two observations
on the above two algorithms: $i)$ RTS works for general M-QAM. Although RTS was
shown to achieve close to optimal performance for 4-QAM in large dimensions,
significant performance improvement was still possible for higher-order QAM
(e.g., 16- and 64-QAM). ii) BP also was shown to achieve near-optimal
performance for large dimensions, but only for $\{\pm 1\}$ alphabet. In this
paper, we improve the large-MIMO detection performance of higher-order QAM
signals by using a hybrid algorithm that employs RTS and BP. In particular,
motivated by the observation that when a detection error occurs at the RTS
output, the least significant bits (LSB) of the symbols are mostly in error, we
propose to first reconstruct and cancel the interference due to bits other than
LSBs at the RTS output and feed the interference cancelled received signal to
the BP algorithm to improve the reliability of the LSBs. The output of the BP
is then fed back to RTS for the next iteration. Our simulation results show
that in a 32 x 32 V-BLAST system, the proposed RTS-BP algorithm performs better
than RTS by about 3.5 dB at $10^{-3}$ uncoded BER and by about 2.5 dB at
$3\times 10^{-4}$ rate-3/4 turbo coded BER with 64-QAM at the same order of
complexity as RTS. We also illustrate the performance of large-MIMO detection
in frequency-selective fading channels.

Theory of Reference Frames it is possible to arrive at new interesting results
in the study and in the analysis of dynamical systems provided with linear
symmetry and central symmetry. Really the most interesting consequences are
relative to the behaviour of microphysical systems and elementary particles.
Some kinematic and dynamic physical parameters, valid for analysis of
mechanical systems, lose meaning in microphysical systems. For these systems it
is necessary to define therefore new parameters on the ground of the behaviour
of observable physical magnitudes. Surely the most important physical quantity,
defined in this paper and relative to elementary particles, is the
electrodynamic mass that is different from mass of mechanical systems. This
parameter allows to understand some features of the behaviour of elementary
particles in inertial and not inertial reference frames. In the last part of
the paper an important relation between time and mass is proved and new general
equations of space time are defined for any reference frame.

study of the intercluster magnetic fields using diffuse radio emission and
Faraday rotation measures in galaxy clusters as probes and the study of star
formation processes in the early Universe using starburst galaxies as probes.
The fourth topic is the exploration of new parameter space for serendipitous

outflow rates of the cold gas (HI) appear to be systematically higher than
those of the ionized gas. The former reach up to ~50 Msun/yr, and are in the

are currently estimated to be a few solar masses per year. However, the kinetic
powers associated with these gaseous outflow are a relatively small fraction (a

observation that the quality of certain sub-paths within each solution may be
higher than the quality of the entire path. A dynamic-programming algorithm,
which we recently developed for comparing and clustering multiple motion paths,
reduces the running time of the merging algorithm significantly. We tested our
algorithm in motion-planning problems with up to 12 degrees of freedom. We show
that our algorithm is able to merge a handful of input paths produced by
several different motion planners to produce output paths of much higher
quality.

measurements of the linear elongational viscosity of two low-density
polyethelenes is presented. A novel method of in-situ measurements of the
diameter of samples under extension has recently been implemented to properly
account for the sample non-uniformities during elongation. Two types of low
density polyethylenes (LDPE's) have been investigated: Lupolen 1840 D and LPDE
1840 H. Whereas in the case of Lupolen 1840 H the Trouton relationship is
verified, in the case of Lupolen 1840 D the deviations can be as large as 40%,
depending on the magnitude of the initial sample non-uniformity and the
experimental conditions. Based on real time visualization of the sample, these
deviations are associated with an inhomogeneous deformation of the specimen.
Differences in the homogeneity of deformation between the H and D samples are
explained by significantly different maximal retardation times. The
experimental investigation is complemented by a simplified theoretical
estimation of the error induced by the sample inhomogeneity in the case of
measurements of elongational viscosities in the linear range. A fair level of
agreement is found with the experimentally measured error.

affected by LSS lensing. The mean projected mass for seven subclumps extracted
from the main cluster potential is <M_2D^(corr)> = (5.06\pm1.30)10^12h^-1 M_sun

subclumps is well described by a truncated singular-isothermal sphere model and
a truncated NFW model. A typical truncated radius of subclumps, r_t\simeq 35
h^-1 kpc, is derived without assuming any relations between mass and light for
member galaxies. The radius coincides well with the tidal radius, \sim42 h^-1

broad-line quasar FTM 0830+3759 (z=0.413) selected from the FIRST/2MASS Red
Quasar survey. For this AGN, a very short 9 ks Chandra exposure had suggested a
feature-rich X-ray spectrum and HST images revealed a very disturbed host
galaxy morphology. Contrary to classical, optically-selected quasars, the X-ray
properties of red (i.e. with J-Ks> 1.7 and R-Ks> 4) broad line quasars are
still quite unexplored, although there is a growing consensus that, due to
moderate obscuration, these objects can offer a unique view of spectral
components typically swamped by the AGN light in normal, blue quasars. The
XMM-Newton observation discussed here has definitely confirmed the complexity
of the X-ray spectrum revealing the presence of a cold (or mildly-ionized)
absorber with Nh ~10^{22} cm^-2 along the line of sight to the nucleus and a
Compton reflection component accompanied by an intense Fe K emission line in
this quasar with a Lum(2-10) ~5 x 10^{44} erg/s. A soft-excess component is
also required by the data. The match between the column density derived by our
spectral analysis and that expected on the basis of reddening due to the dust
suggests the possibility that both absorptions occur in the same medium. FTM
0830+3759 is characterized by an extinction/absorption-corrected
X-ray-to-optical flux ratio alphaox = -2.3, that is steeper than expected on
the basis of its UV luminosity. These findings indicate that the X-ray
properties of FTM 0830+3759 differs from those typically observed for
optically-selected broad line quasars with comparable hard X-ray luminosity.

dependence of the tunnelling magnetoresistance with the bias voltage and the

the localization of all the impurity levels within a single atomic layer. In

parameter, which reflects the number of single levels on the total density of

(BS) with $M$ antennas connected to a central station (CS) serve $K$
single-antenna user terminals (UT). Although many works have shown the
potential benefits of network MIMO, the conclusion critically depends on the
underlying assumptions such as channel state information at transmitters (CSIT)
and backhaul links. In this paper, by focusing on the impact of partial CSIT,
we propose an outage-efficient strategy. Namely, with side information of all
UT's messages and local CSIT, each BS applies zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming in
a distributed manner. For a small number of UTs ($K\leq M$), the ZF beamforming
creates $K$ parallel MISO channels. Based on the statistical knowledge of these
parallel channels, the CS performs a robust power allocation that
simultaneously minimizes the outage probability of all UTs and achieves a
diversity gain of $B(M-K+1)$ per UT. With a large number of UTs ($K \geq M$),
we propose a so-called distributed diversity scheduling (DDS) scheme to select
a subset of $\Ks$ UTs with limited backhaul communication. It is proved that
DDS achieves a diversity gain of $B\frac{K}{\Ks}(M-\Ks+1)$, which scales
optimally with the number of cooperative BSs $B$ as well as UTs. Numerical
results confirm that even under realistic assumptions such as partial CSIT and
limited backhaul communications, network MIMO can offer high data rates with a
sufficient reliability to individual UTs.

left SU(2) transformations, the Slavnov-Taylor identity, required in order to
fulfill physical unitarity, and the Landau gauge equation hold in the
nonlinearly realized theory. The quantization is performed in the Landau gauge
for the sake of simplicity and elegance. The constraints on the admissible
interactions arising from the Weak Power-Counting (WPC) are discussed. The same
symmetric pattern of the couplings as in the Standard Model is shown to arise,
as a consequence of the defining functional identities and the WPC. However,
two independent mass invariants in the vector meson sector are possible, i.e.
no tree-level Weinberg relation holds between the Z and W mass. Majorana
neutrino masses can be implemented in the nonlinearly realized Electroweak
Model in a way compatible with the WPC and all the symmetries of the theory.

identify a sharp edge in the radial X-ray surface brightness of the main

gas sloshing around the cluster potential minimum. We present observational
evidence, supported by hydrodynamic simulations, that the northern subcluster
is the object which initiated the core gas sloshing in the main cluster at
least 700 Myr ago. We discuss reheating of the main cluster's core gas via two
mechanisms brought about by the sloshing gas: first, the release of
gravitational potential energy gained by the core's displacement from the
potential minimum, and second, a dredging inwards of the outer, higher entropy
cluster gas along finger-shaped streams. We find the available gravitational
potential energy is small compared to the energy released by the cooling gas in

any backward scattering process mediated by the chemical-potential-type
impurity is always canceled by its time-reversal (T-reversal) counter-process,
because of the non-trivial Berry phase supported by these two processes in the

backward scattering processes which conserve a certain internal degree of
freedom, i.e. the parity density, while the `absolute' stability of the TQCP
against any non-magnetic disorders is required by the bulk-edge correspondence.
Motivated by this, we further derive the self-consistent-Born phase diagram in
the presence of generic non-magnetic disorder potentials and argue the
behaviour of the quantum conductivity correction in such cases. The distinction
and similarity between the case with only the chemical-potential-type disorder
and that with the generic non-magnetic disorders are finally summarized.

transferring gas from an extensive corona to the star-forming disc. The
transfer is effected by the galactic fountain -- cool clouds that are shot up
from the plane to kiloparsec heights above the plane. The Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability strips gas from these clouds. If the pressure and the the
metallicity of the corona are high enough, the stripped gas causes a similar
mass of coronal gas to condense in the cloud's wake. Hydrodynamical simulations
of cloud-corona interaction are presented. These confirm the existence of a
critical ablation rate above which the corona is condensed, and imply that for
the likely parameters of the Galactic corona this rate lies near the actual
ablation rate of clouds. In external galaxies trails of HI behind individual
clouds will not be detectable, although the integrated emission from all such
trails should be significant. Parts of the trails of the clouds that make up
the Galaxy's fountain should be observable and may account for features in
targeted 21-cm observations of individual high-velocity clouds and surveys of
Galactic HI emission. Taken in conjunction with the known decline in the
availability of cold infall with increasing cosmic time and halo mass, the
proposed mechanism offers a promising explanation of the division of galaxies
between the blue cloud to the red sequence in the colour-luminosity plane.

visual extinction (A_V) maps of 17 Galactic clouds to analyse the spatial
structure using the Delta-variance method. This sample contains a large variety
of different molecular cloud types with different star forming activity. The
Delta-variance spectra obtained from the A_V maps show differences between
low-mass star-forming (SF) clouds and massive giant molecular clouds (GMC) in
terms of shape of the spectrum and its power-law exponent beta. Low-mass SF
clouds have a double-peak structure with characteristic size scales around 1 pc
(though with a large scatter around this value) and 4 pc. GMCs show no
characteristic scale in the A_V-maps, which can partly be ascribed to a
distance effect due to a larger line-of-sight (LOS) confusion. The
Delta-variance for Cygnus, determined from the 13CO survey, shows
characteristic scales at 4 pc and 40 pc, either reflecting the filament
structure and large-scale turbulence forcing or - for the 4 pc scale - the
scale below which the 13CO 1-0 line becomes optically thick. Though there are
different processes that can introduce characteristic scales, i.e. geometry,
decaying turbulence the transition scale from supersonic to subsonic turbulence
(the sonic scale), line-of-sight effects and energy injection due to expanding
supernova shells, outflows, HII-regions, and the relative contribution of these
effects strongly varies from cloud to cloud, it is remarkable that the
resulting turbulent structure of molecular clouds shows similar
characteristics.

$\gamma(\gamma^*)+p\to V+ X$ with large rapidity gap at small x and large
momentum $-t$ transferred to $V$ in pQCD. Here V is a heavy quarkonium
($J/\psi, \Upsilon$) or longitudinally polarized light vector meson (in the
electroproduction processes), etc. In the kinematics of HERA we calculate the
dependence on energy of cross sections of these processes as the function of
momentum transfer $t$, photon virtuality $Q^2$ and/or quarkonium mass. In the
kinematical region $Q_0^2\le -t\ll Q^2+M^2_V$ the nontrivial energy dependence
of the cross section for the vector meson production due to the photon
scattering off a parton follows within QCD from the summing of the double
logarithmic terms. In the second regime $-t\ge Q^2+M^2_V$ within DGLAP
approximation in all orders of perturbation theory the $q\bar q - {\rm parton}$
elastic cross section is energy independent. We show that the correct account
of the double logarithmic terms and of the gluon radiation including
kinematical constraints removes the disagreement between pQCD calculations and
recent HERA experimental data. The explicit formula for the dependence of the
differential cross section$\displaystyle{\frac{d^2\sigma}{dtdx_J}}$ of these
processes on $s_{\gamma^*N}$ is obtained. We show that perturbative Pomeron
type behavior may reveal itself only at energies significantly larger than
those available at HERA. In addition we evaluate the energy dependence of DCVS
processes.

collapse of a massive, rotating molecular cloud that includes heating by both
non-ionizing and ionizing radiation. We find that as the first protostars gain
sufficient mass to ionize the accretion flow, their H II regions are initially
gravitationally trapped, but soon begin to rapidly fluctuate between trapped
and extended states, in agreement with observations. Over time, the same
ultracompact H II region can expand anisotropically, contract again, and take
on any of the observed morphological classes. In their extended phases,
expanding H II regions drive bipolar neutral outflows characteristic of
high-mass star formation. The total lifetime of H II regions is given by the
global accretion timescale, rather than their short internal sound-crossing
time. The pressure of the hot, ionized gas does not terminate accretion.
Instead the final stellar mass is set by fragmentation-induced starvation.
Local gravitational instabilities in the accretion flow lead to the build-up of
a small cluster of stars, all with relatively high masses due to heating from
accretion radiation. These companions subsequently compete with the initial
high-mass star for the same common gas reservoir and limit its mass growth. Our
findings show that the most significant differences between the formation of
low-mass and high-mass stars are all explained as the result of rapid accretion
within a dense, gravitationally unstable, ionized flow.

  Methods. We identified the WR features in these spectra by fitting the WR
bumps and WR emission lines in blue and red bumps. We also identified the
subtypes of the WR stars, and estimated the numbers of stars in each subtype,
then calculated the WR/O star ratios. The (O/H) abundances of GRB hosts were
estimated from both the electron temperature (Te) and the metallicity-sensitive
strong-line ratio (R23), for which we have broken the R23 degeneracy. We
compared the environments of long-duration GRB host galaxies with those of
other galaxies in terms of their luminosity (stellar mass)-metallicity

  Results. We detected the presence of WR stars in 5 GRB host galaxies having
spectra with relatively high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N). In the comparison of
LZ, MZ relations, it shows that GRB hosts have lower metallicities than other
samples with comparable luminosity and stellar mass. The presence of WR stars

practical importance and more than a century of intense research. The
theoretical understanding of the transition process has been complicated by the
lack of a linear instability mechanism and additionally by a catastrophic
collapse of turbulence which can occur after extremely long lifetimes.
Turbulence close to onset is investigated experimentally in three different
geometries: pipe, duct and channel flow. The reverse transition from turbulent
to laminar flow is observed to be a general feature of shear flows. A critical
point is uncovered at slightly higher flow rates, where the nature of the flow
changes abruptly to the generic case of expanding turbulence. The critical

confirms a conjecture made over 20 years ago based on an analogy between fluid

the initial spin period, the braking index, the magnetic field, various beaming

reconcile various models currently being studied. We conclude that, in order to
account for recent evidence for the alignment found by Weltevrede & Johnston,
the braking torque on a neutron star should not depend strongly on the
inclination. Our simulation code is publically available and includes a

to expand our understanding of the formation and early evolution of stars and
planets. We aim at revealing the sub-AU disk structure around the 10 Myr old
Herbig Be star HD100546 and at investigating the origin of its near and
mid-infrared excess. We used AMBER/VLTI observations to resolve the K-band
emission and to constrain the location and composition of the hot dust in the
innermost disk. Combining AMBER observations with photometric and MIDI/VLTI
measurements from the litterature, we revisit the disk geometry using a passive
disk model based on 3D radiative transfer. We propose a model that includes a
tenuous inner disk made of micron-sized dust grains, a gap, and a massive
optically thick outer disk, that successfully reproduces the interferometric
data and the SED. We locate the bulk of the K-band emission at ~0.26 AU.
Assuming that this emission originates from silicate, we show that micron-sized
grains are required to enable the dust to survive at such a distance from the
star. As a consequence, more than 40% of the K-band flux is related to
scattering, showing that direct thermal emission is not sufficient to explain
the near-infrared excess. In the massive outer disk, large grains in the
mid-plane are responsible for the mm emission while a surface layer of small
grains allows the mid and far infrared excesses to be reproduced. Such vertical
structure may be an evidence for sedimentation. The observations are consistent
with a model that includes a gap until ~13 AU and a total dust mass of ~0.008
lunar mass inside it. These values together with the derived scale height (~2.5
AU) and temperature (~220 K) at the inner edge of the outer disk (r=13 AU), are
consistent with recent CO observations.
