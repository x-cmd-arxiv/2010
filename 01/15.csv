can persist throughout inflation, avoiding Wald's no-hair theorem. After
discussing scenarios in which anisotropy can persist during inflation, we
calculate the dominant effects of a small persistent anisotropy on the

unprecedentedly wide range of descendant halo mass (10^10 < M0 < 10^15 Msun),
progenitor mass ratio (10^-5 < xi < 1), and redshift (0 < z < 15). We update
our earlier fitting form for the mean merger rate per halo as a function of
M_0, xi, and z. The overall behavior of this quantity is unchanged: the rate
per unit redshift is nearly independent of z out to z~15; the dependence on
halo mass is weak (M0^0.13); and it is nearly a power law in the progenitor
mass ratio (xi^-2). We also present a simple and accurate fitting formula for
the mean mass growth rate of haloes as a function of mass and redshift. This
mean rate is 46 Msun/yr for 10^12 Msun haloes at z=0, and it increases with
mass as M^{1.1} and with redshift as (1+z)^2.5 (for z > 1). When the fit for
the mean mass growth rate is integrated over a halo's history, we find
excellent match to the mean mass assembly histories of the simulated haloes. By
combining merger rates and mass assembly histories, we present results for the

(CSI) at the transmitter. This paper makes three contributions: first, we
provide an end-to-end SMSE transceiver design that incorporates receiver
combining, feedback policy and transmit precoder design with channel
uncertainty. This enables the proposed transceiver to outperform the previously
derived limited feedback MU linear transceivers. Second, we remove
dimensionality constraints on the MIMO system, for the scenario with multiple
data streams per user, using a combination of maximum expected signal combining
(MESC) and minimum MSE receiver. This makes the feedback of each user
independent of the others and the resulting feedback overhead scales linearly
with the number of data streams instead of the number of receiving antennas.
Finally, we analyze SMSE of the proposed algorithm at high signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and large number of transmit antennas. As an aside, we show
analytically why the bit error rate, in the high SNR regime, increases if
quantization error is ignored.

dimensionality, a spatial discretization scheme must be prescribed. The known
fact that the KPZ equation can be obtained as a result of a Hopf--Cole
transformation applied to a diffusion equation (with \emph{multiplicative}
noise) is shown here to strongly restrict the arbitrariness in the choice of
spatial discretization schemes. On one hand, the discretization prescriptions
for the Laplacian and the nonlinear (KPZ) term cannot be independently chosen.
On the other hand, since the discretization is an operation performed on
\emph{space} and the Hopf--Cole transformation is \emph{local} both in space
and time, the former should be the same regardless of the field to which it is
applied. It is shown that whereas some discretization schemes pass both
consistency tests, known examples in the literature do not. The requirement of
consistency for the discretization of Lyapunov functionals is argued to be a
natural and safe starting point in choosing spatial discretization schemes. We
also analyze the relation between real-space and pseudo-spectral discrete
representations. In addition we discuss the relevance of the Galilean
invariance violation in these consistent discretization schemes, and the
alleged conflict of standard discretization with the fluctuation--dissipation

maps along each emission-line profile. The HCN flux distributions are similar
to those observed for the CO emission, but with some knots of high intensities

hyperfine line ratios for both HII regions differ from those predicted

maximum likelihood decoding metric. We then propose novel bit-flipping (BF)
decoding algorithms that take into account the check node reliability. Both
hard-decision (HD) and soft-decision (SD) versions are considered. The former
performs better than the conventional BF algorithm and, in most cases, suffers
less than 1 dB performance loss when compared with some well known SD BF
decoders. For one particular code it even outperforms those SD BF decoders. The
performance of the SD version is superior to that of SD BF decoders and is
comparable to or even better than that of the sum-product algorithm (SPA). The
latter is achieved with a complexity much less than that required by the SPA.

established that the sets of numbers that are recognizable by weak
deterministic automata in two bases that do not share the same set of prime
factors are exactly those that are definable in the first order additive theory
of real and integer numbers. This result extends Cobham's theorem, which
characterizes the sets of integer numbers that are recognizable by finite
automata in multiple bases.
  In this article, we first generalize this result to multiplicatively
independent bases, which brings it closer to the original statement of Cobham's
theorem. Then, we study the sets of reals recognizable by Muller automata in
two bases. We show with a counterexample that, in this setting, Cobham's
theorem does not generalize to multiplicatively independent bases. Finally, we
prove that the sets of reals that are recognizable by Muller automata in two
bases that do not share the same set of prime factors are exactly those
definable in the first order additive theory of real and integer numbers. These
sets are thus also recognizable by weak deterministic automata. This result
leads to a precise characterization of the sets of real numbers that are
recognizable in multiple bases, and provides a theoretical justification to the
use of weak automata as symbolic representations of sets.

have the potential to discover low-level non gaussian features in the Cosmic

(CR), which produce spurious spikes in bolometric signals. In this paper we
analyze how CR affect these measurements and the estimates of non-gaussianity
and of angular power spectra of the CMB. Using accurate simulations of noise
and CR events in bolometric detectors, we find that a de-spiking technique
based on outliers removal in the detector signals contributing to the same sky
pixel works well in removing CR events larger than the noise. Low level events
hidden in the noise produce skewness and kurtosis of the temperatures of the
pixels, indicating low-level non-gaussianity. Moreover, when the low-level CR
distribution is not known a-priori, the standard noise estimation pipeline
produces a positive bias of the power spectrum at high multipoles. In
experiments with detector sensitivity better than 100 $\mu K / \sqrt{Hz}$, in
an environment less favorable than the earth stratosphere, the CR-induced non
gaussianity is likely to affect significantly the results.

(CEMP) stars from the Hamburg/ESO (HES) prism-survey plates. This method
employs an extended line index for the CH G-band, which we demonstrate to have
superior behavior when compared to the narrower G-band index formerly employed
to estimate G-band strengths for these spectra. Although CEMP stars have been
found previously among candidate metal-poor stars selected from the HES, the
selection on metallicity undersamples the population of
intermediate-metallicity CEMP stars (-2.5<=[Fe/H]<=-1.0); such stars are of
importance for constraining the onset of the s-process in metal-deficient
asymptotic giant-branch stars (thought to be associated with the origin of
carbon for roughly 80% of CEMP stars). The new candidates also include
substantial numbers of warmer carbon-enhanced stars, which were missed in
previous HES searches for carbon stars due to selection criteria that
emphasized stars with cooler temperatures.
  A first subsample, biased towards brighter stars (B<15.5), has been extracted
from the scanned HES plates. After visual inspection, a list of 669 previously
unidentified candidate CEMP stars was compiled. Follow-up spectroscopy for a
pilot sample of 132 candidates was obtained with the Goodman spectrograph on
the SOAR 4.1m telescope. Our results show that most of the observed stars lie
in the targeted metallicity range, and possess prominent carbon absorption
features at 4300A. The success rate for the identification of new CEMP stars is
43% (13 out of 30) for [Fe/H]<-2.0. For stars with [Fe/H]<-2.5, the ratio
increases to 80% (4 out of 5 objects), including one star with [Fe/H]<-3.0.

the superconducting pairing symmetry in two polycrystalline samples of
signficantly different purities. In the high purity sample, we detected no
time-reversal symmetry breaking fields greater than 0.05 G. The superfluid
density was also found to be exponentially-flat as T$\to $0, and so can be fit
to a single-gap BCS model. In contrast, the lower purity sample showed an
increase in the zero-field $\mu$SR relaxation rate below T$_c$ corresponding to
a characteristic field strength of 0.6 G. While the temperature-dependence of
the superfluid density was also found to be consistent with a single-gap BCS
model, the magnitude as T$\to $0 was found to be much lower for a given applied
field than in the case of the high purity sample. These findings suggest that
the dominant pairing symmetry in high quality Mg$_{10}$Ir$_{19}$B$_{16}$

functions from the radial Dirac equations. After an brief introduction, in
Section II we solve the equations for a linear Lorentz scalar potential,
V_s(r), that provides for confinement of a quark. The case of massless u and d
quarks is treated first, as these are necessarily quite relativistic. We use an
iterative procedure to find the eigenenergies and the upper and lower component
wave functions for the ground state and then, later, some excited states.
Solutions for the massive quarks (s, c, and b) are also presented. In Section
III we solve for the case of a Coulomb potential, which is a time-like
component of a Lorentz vector potential, V_v(r). We re-derive, numerically, the
(analytically well-known) relativistic hydrogen atom eigenenergies and wave
functions, and later extend that to the cases of heavier one-electron atoms and
muonic atoms. Finally, Section IV finds solutions for a combination of the V_s
and V_v potentials. We treat two cases. The first is one in which V_s is the
linear potential used in Sec. II and V_v is Coulombic, as in Sec. III. The
other is when both V_s and V_v are linearly confining, and we establish when
these potentials give a vanishing spin-orbit interaction (as has been shown to
be the case in quark models of the hadronic spectrum).

supply rate of granular fluids within the frameworks of the Boltzmann equation
and continuum thermodynamics. It is shown that the entropy inequality for a
granular gas that follows from the Boltzmann equation differs from the one of a
simple fluid due to the presence of a term which can be identified as the rate
of entropy supply density. From the knowledge of a non-equilibrium distribution
function -- valid for for processes closed to equilibrium and quasi-elastic
restitution coefficients -- it is obtained that the rate of entropy supply
density is equal to the rate of internal energy production density divided by
the temperature and the entropy flux is equal to the heat flux vector divided
by the temperature. A thermodynamic theory of a granular fluid is also
developed whose objective is the determination of the basic fields of mass
density, momentum density and internal energy density. The constitutive laws
are restricted by the principle of material frame indifference and by the
entropy principle. Through the exploitation of the entropy principle with
Lagrange multipliers, it is shown that the results obtained from the kinetic
theory for granular gases concerning the rate of entropy supply density and
entropy flux are valid in general for processes close to equilibrium of
granular fluids, where linearized constitutive equations hold.

thick disk, in agreement with our previous study of C, N and O but in contrast
to other groups relying on literature values for nearby disk dwarf stars. For
-1.5 < [Fe/H] < -0.3 exactly the same trend is followed by both the bulge and
thick disk stars, with a star-to-star scatter of only 0.03 dex. Furthermore,
both populations share the location of the knee in the [alpha/Fe] vs [Fe/H]
diagram. It still remains to be confirmed that the local thick disk extends to
super-solar metallicities as is the case for the bulge. These are the most
stringent constraints to date on the chemical similarity of these stellar
populations. Our findings suggest that the bulge and local thick disk stars
experienced similar formation timescales, star formation rates and initial mass
functions, confirming thus the main outcomes of our previous homogeneous
analysis of [O/Fe] from infrared spectra for nearly the same sample. The
identical alpha-enhancements of thick disk and bulge stars may reflect a rapid
chemical evolution taking place before the bulge and thick disk structures we

the coupling with the spin degree of freedom, a competition between the two

nonpertubative phenomena, such as the emergence of novel quantum phases:
indeed, we demonstrate that the strongly coupled fixed point may become

  We point out that a Josephson junction network with a pertinent impurity

the assumption that the experimentally found discrete ion conduction events are
due to a particular class of proteins called ion channels while the lipid
membrane is considered being an inert electrical insulator. The particular
protein structure is thought to be related to ion specificity, specific
recognition of drugs by receptors and to macroscopic phenomena as nerve pulse
propagation. However, lipid membranes in their chain melting regime are known
to be highly permeable to ions, water and small molecules, and are therefore
not always inert. In voltage-clamp experiments one finds quantized conduction
events through protein-free membranes in their melting regime similar to or
even undistinguishable from those attributed to proteins. This constitutes a
conceptual problem for the interpretation of electrophysiological data obtained
from biological membrane preparations. Here, we review the experimental
evidence for lipid ion channels, their properties and the physical chemistry
underlying their creation. We introduce into the thermodynamic theory of
membrane fluctuations from which the lipid channels originate. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how the appearance of lipid channels can be influenced by the
alteration of the thermodynamic variables (temperature, pressure, tension,
chemical potentials) in a coherent description that is free of parameters. This
description leads to pores that display dwell times closely coupled to the
fluctuation lifetime via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Drugs as
anesthetics and neurotransmitters are shown to influence the channel likelihood
and their lifetimes in a predictable manner. We also discuss the role of
proteins in influencing the likelihood of lipid channel formation.

stellar coronal magnetic fields. This uses Zeeman-Doppler magnetograms of the
surface magnetic field as a lower boundary condition. The ZDI maps, however,
suffer from the absence of information about the magnetic field over regions of
the surface due to the presence of dark starspots and portions of the surface
out of view due to a tilt in the rotation axis. They also suffer from finite
resolution which leads to small scale field structures being neglected.
  This paper explores the effects of this loss of information on the
extrapolated coronal fields. For this we use simulated stellar surface magnetic
maps for two hypothetical stars. Using the potential field approximation, the
coronal fields and emission measures are calculated. This is repeated for the
cases of missing information due to, (i) starspots, (ii) a large area of the
stellar surface out of view, (iii) a finite resolution.
  The largest effect on the magnetic field structure arises when a significant
portion of the stellar surface remains out of view. This changes the nature of
the field lines that connect to this obscured hemisphere. Nonetheless, the
field structure in the visible hemisphere is reliably reproduced. Thus the
calculation of the locations and surface filling factors of accretion funnels
is reasonably well reproduced for the observed hemisphere. The decrease with
height of the magnetic pressure, which is important in calculating disc
truncation radii for accreting stars, is also largely unaffected in the
equatorial plane. The fraction of surface flux that is open and therefore able
to supply angular momentum loss in a wind, however, is often overestimated in
the presence of missing flux.

  LaAlO3 has a layered structure along the (001) direction with alternating LaO

consequence of that, an oxygen deficient TiO2 film with anatase structure will
grow preferently on the AlO2 surface layer. We have therefore performed

structural details, such as second neighbor positions. These results are
obtained using both the LSDA and LSDA+U approximations.

""high-rate"" Reed-Solomon code as the outer code -- results in substantially
improved performance. In particular, code concatenation with a careful choice
of parameters boosts the rate of decay of the probability of error to almost
exponential in the block-length with essentially no loss in computational
complexity. We demonstrate such performance improvements for three sets of
information-theoretic problems -- a classical point-to-point channel coding
problem, a class of multiple-input multiple output channel coding problems, and
some network source coding problems.

both forward and reverse directions. Also, we observed a voltage--independent
offset of the photocurrent. As this offset is crucial for the device

prove that the inverse of Carlitz's analog of $\pi$, $\Pi_q$, has in general a
linear complexity, except in the case $q=2$, when the complexity is quadratic.
In particular, this implies the transcendence of $\Pi_2$ over $\F_2(T)$. In the

topological properties of superconducting Dirac fermions in 3D having a color
superconductor as an application. In the chiral limit, when the pairing gap is
parity even, the right-handed and left-handed sectors of the free space
Hamiltonian have nontrivial topological charges with opposite signs.
Accordingly, a vortex line in the superconductor supports localized gapless
right-handed and left-handed fermions with the dispersion relations E=+/-vp_z
(v is a parameter dependent velocity) and thus propagating in opposite
directions along the vortex line. However, the presence of the fermion mass
immediately opens up a mass gap for such localized fermions and the dispersion
relations become E=+/-v(m^2+p_z^2)^(1/2). When the pairing gap is parity odd,
the situation is qualitatively different. The right-handed and left-handed
sectors of the free space Hamiltonian in the chiral limit have nontrivial
topological charges with the same sign and therefore the presence of the small
fermion mass does not open up a mass gap for the fermions localized around the
vortex line. When the fermion mass is increased further, there is a topological
phase transition at m=(\mu^2+\Delta^2)^(1/2) and the localized gapless fermions
disappear. We also elucidate the existence of gapless surface fermions
localized at a boundary when two phases with different topological charges are
connected. A part of our results is relevant to the color superconductivity of

isotropic distribution. BMPs not affected by tidal forces are found to have
high eccentricities with non-thermal eccentricity distribution peaking at
intermediate eccentricities (typically 0.4-0.6). The high inclinations and

from an interaction. Considering that disk galaxies may have formed and evolved
through minor mergers or through major mergers, it is important to understand
the mechanisms at play during each type of merger in order to be able to
establish the outcome of such an event. In some cases, only the use of both
morphological and kinematical information can disentangle the actual
configuration of an encounter at intermediate redshift.
  In this work, we present the morphological and kinematical analysis of a

and evolution. Using the integral field spectrograph GIRAFFE, long-slit
spectroscopy by FORS2 and direct optical images from the HST-ACS and ISAAC

galaxy with a very bright bar in interaction with a smaller companion with a

lies at a closer distance of ~1 kpc, instead of previously assumed ~2-3 kpc
from kinematic distances. The previously suggested deviation of the Sagittarius
arm toward the Galactic center from the symmetrically fitted model (Taylor &
Cordes 1993) is likely due to large errors of kinematic distances at low
galactic longitudes. G14.33-0.64 most likely traces the near side of the

applications that are self-configuring, scalable, and resilient to node
failures. Such systems have been successfully adopted in large-scale Internet
services such as content delivery networks and file sharing; however,
widespread adoption in small/medium scales has been limited due in part to
security concerns and difficulty bootstrapping in NAT-constrained environments.
Nonetheless, P2P systems can be designed to provide guaranteed lookup times,
NAT traversal, point-to-point overlay security, and distributed data stores. In
this paper we propose a novel way of creating overlays that are both secure and
private and a method to bootstrap them using a public overlay. Private overlay
nodes use the public overlay's distributed data store to discover each other,
and the public overlay's connections to assist with NAT hole punching and as
relays providing STUN and TURN NAT traversal techniques. The security framework
utilizes groups, which are created and managed by users through a web based
user interface. Each group acts as a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) relying on
the use of a centrally-managed web site providing an automated Certificate
Authority (CA). We present a reference implementation which has been used in a
P2P VPN (Virtual Private Network). To evaluate our contributions, we apply our
techniques to an overlay network modeler, event-driven simulations using
simulated time delays, and deployment in the PlanetLab wide-area testbed.

formulated by Yuri Gurevich in 1988. It is still wide open and regarded as one

results have been obtained for specific classes of structures. In particular,
it is known that fixed-point logic with counting captures polynomial time on
all classes of graphs with excluded minors. The introductory part of this paper
is a short survey of the state-of-the-art in the quest for a logic capturing

  The main part of the paper is concerned with classes of graphs defined by
excluding induced subgraphs. Two of the most fundamental such classes are the
class of chordal graphs and the class of line graphs. We prove that capturing
polynomial time on either of these classes is as hard as capturing it on the
class of all graphs. In particular, this implies that fixed-point logic with
counting does not capture polynomial time on these classes. Then we prove that
fixed-point logic with counting does capture polynomial time on the class of

approximations within density functional theory and GW calculations. In
particular, we propose very small (R < 0.5 nm) but surprisingly stable
nanotubes with promising properties. The nanotubes are initially formed from
TiO2 layers with the PtO2 structure, with the smallest (2,2) nanotube relaxing
to a rutile nanorod structure. We find that quantum confinement effects - as
expected - generally lead to a widening of the energy gap. However,
substitutional doping with boron or nitrogen is found to give rise to
(meta-)stable structures and the introduction of dopant and mid-gap states
which effectively reduce the band gap. Boron is seen to always give rise to
n-type doping while depending on the local bonding geometry, nitrogen may give
rise to n-type or p-type doping. For under coordinated TiO2 surface structures
found in clusters, nanorods, nanotubes, layers and surfaces nitrogen gives rise
to acceptor states while for larger clusters and bulk structures donor states
are introduced.

polarization, and parsec-scale structure of the quasar PKS 1510-089,
concentrating on eight major gamma-ray flares that occurred during the interval
2009.0-2009.5. The gamma-ray peaks were essentially simultaneous with maxima at
optical wavelengths, although the flux ratio of the two wavebands varied by an
order of magnitude. The optical polarization vector rotated by 720 degrees
during a 5-day period encompassing six of these flares. This culminated in a
very bright, roughly 1 day, optical and gamma-ray flare as a bright knot of
emission passed through the highest-intensity, stationary feature (the ""core"")
seen in 43 GHz Very Long Baseline Array images. The knot continued to propagate
down the jet at an apparent speed of 22c and emit strongly at gamma-ray
energies as a months-long X-ray/radio outburst intensified. We interpret these
events as the result of the knot following a spiral path through a mainly
toroidal magnetic field pattern in the acceleration and collimation zone of the
jet, after which it passes through a standing shock in the 43 GHz core and then
continues downstream. In this picture, the rapid gamma-ray flares result from
scattering of infrared seed photons from a relatively slow sheath of the jet as
well as from optical synchrotron radiation in the faster spine. The 2006-2009.7
radio and X-ray flux variations are correlated at very high significance; we
conclude that the X-rays are mainly from inverse Compton scattering of infrared
seed photons by 20-40 MeV electrons.

have performance constraints as all traffic must traverse through a central
server. In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift towards the use of P2P
in VPNs to alleviate pressure placed upon the central server by allowing
participants to communicate directly with each other, relegating the server to
handling session management and supporting NAT traversal using relays when
necessary. Another, less common, approach uses unstructured P2P systems to
remove all centralization from the VPN. These approaches currently lack the
depth in security options provided by other VPN solutions, and their
scalability constraints have not been well studied.
  In this paper, we propose and implement a novel VPN architecture, which uses
a structured P2P system for peer discovery, session management, NAT traversal,
and autonomic relay selection and a central server as a partially-automated
public key infrastructure (PKI) via a user-friendly web interface. Our model
also provides the first design and implementation of a P2P VPN with full
tunneling support, whereby all non-P2P based Internet traffic routes through a
trusted third party and does so in a way that is more secure than existing full
tunnel techniques. To verify our model, we evaluate our reference
implementation by comparing it quantitatively to other VPN technologies
focusing on latency, bandwidth, and memory usage. We also discuss some of our
experiences with developing, maintaining, and deploying a P2P VPN.

extreme mass ratio binary (EMRB) systems are described by distributionally
forced master wave equations. Numerical solution of a master wave equation as
an initial boundary value problem requires initial data. However, because the
correct initial data for generic-orbit systems is unknown, specification of
trivial initial data is a common choice, despite being inconsistent and
resulting in a solution which is initially discontinuous in time. As is well
known, this choice leads to a ""burst"" of junk radiation which eventually
propagates off the computational domain. We observe another unintended
consequence of trivial initial data: development of a persistent spurious
solution, here referred to as the Jost junk solution, which contaminates the
physical solution for long times. This work studies the influence of both types
of junk on metric perturbations, waveforms, and self-force measurements, and it
demonstrates that smooth modified source terms mollify the Jost solution and
reduce junk radiation. Our concluding section discusses the applicability of
these observations to other numerical schemes and techniques used to solve

systematic treatment of mixtures. It is proposed that a formulation of
thermodynamics as an action principle may be a suitable approach to adopt for a
new investigation. This third paper of the series applies the action principle
to a study of mixtures of ideal gases. The action for a mixture of ideal gases
is the sum of the actions for the components, with an entropy that, in the
absence of gravity, is determined by the Gibbs-Dalton hypothesis. Chemical
reactions such as hydrogen dissociation are studied, with results that include
the Saha equation and that are more complete than traditional treatments,
especially so when gravitational effects are included. A mixture of two ideal
gases is a system with two degrees of freedom and consequently it exhibits two
kinds of sound. In the presence of gravity the Gibbs-Dalton hypothesis is
modified to get results that agree with observation. The possibility of a
parallel treatment of real gases is illustrated by an application to van der
Waals gases. The overall conclusion is that experimental results serve to pin
down the lagrangian in a very efficient manner. This leads to a convenient
theoretical framework in which many dynamical problems can be studied.

high-frequency peaked BL Lac object 1ES 1218+304 in 2008/2009. Although 1ES
1218+304 was detected previously by MAGIC and VERITAS at a persistent level of
~6% of the Crab Nebula flux, the new VERITAS data reveal a prominent flare
reaching ~20% of the Crab. While very high energy (VHE) flares are quite common
in many nearby blazars, the case of 1ES 1218+304 (redshift z = 0.182) is
particularly interesting since it belongs to a group of blazars that exhibit
unusually hard VHE spectra considering their redshifts. When correcting the
measured spectra for absorption by the extragalactic background light, 1ES
1218+304 and a number of other blazars are found to have differential photon
indices less than 1.5. The difficulty in modeling these hard spectral energy
distributions in blazar jets has led to a range of theoretical gamma-ray
emission scenarios, one of which is strongly constrained by these new VERITAS
observations. We consider the implications of the observed light curve of 1ES
1218+304, which shows day scale flux variations, for shock acceleration
scenarios in relativistic jets, and in particular for the viability of
kiloparsec-scale jet emission scenarios.

demonstrating that the binary system is most probably comprised of a massive
white dwarf with Teff=12000+/-1000 K and a brown dwarf of spectral type L4. The
inferred system parameters suggest that this system may have evolved beyond the
orbital period minimum and is a bounce-back system. SDSS1238 stands out among
CVs by exhibiting the cyclical variability (brightenings). These are not
related to specific orbital phases of the binary system and are fainter than
dwarf novae outbursts, that usually occur on longer timescales. This phenomenon
has not been observed extensively and, thus, is poor understood. The new
time-resolved, multi-longitude photometric observations of SDSS1238 allowed us
to observe two consecutive brightenings and to determine their recurrence time.
The period analysis of all observed brightenings during 2007 suggests a typical
timescale that is close to a period of ~9.3 hours. However, the brightenings
modulation is not strictly periodic, possibly maintaining coherence only on
timescales of several weeks. The characteristic variability with double orbital
frequency that clearly shows up during brightenings is also analyzed. The
Doppler mapping of the system shows the permanent presence of a spiral arm
pattern in the accretion disk. A simple model is presented to demonstrate that
spiral arms in the velocity map appear at the location and phase corresponding
to the 2:1 resonance radius and constitute themselves as a double-humped light
curves. The long-term and short-term variability of this CV is discussed
together with the spiral arm structure of an accretion disk in the context of
observational effects taking place in bounce-back systems.

and has many applications in the real world. A main drawback of manifold
learning methods is, however, that there is no explicit mappings from the input
data manifold to the output embedding. This prohibits the application of
manifold learning methods in many practical problems such as classification and
target detection. Previously, in order to provide explicit mappings for
manifold learning methods, many methods have been proposed to get an
approximate explicit representation mapping with the assumption that there
exists a linear projection between the high-dimensional data samples and their
low-dimensional embedding. However, this linearity assumption may be too
restrictive. In this paper, an explicit nonlinear mapping is proposed for
manifold learning, based on the assumption that there exists a polynomial
mapping between the high-dimensional data samples and their low-dimensional
representations. As far as we know, this is the first time that an explicit
nonlinear mapping for manifold learning is given. In particular, we apply this
to the method of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and derive an explicit
nonlinear manifold learning algorithm, named Neighborhood Preserving Polynomial
Embedding (NPPE). Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data
show that the proposed mapping is much more effective in preserving the local
neighborhood information and the nonlinear geometry of the high-dimensional
data samples than previous work.

medium (WIM) because of the turbulent motion. This effect is enhanced in
starburst galaxies, where gas is ionized and turbulence is sustained by massive
stars. Moreover, dust production by Type II supernovae (SNe II) can be
efficient in starburst galaxies. In this paper, we examine the effect of
shattering in WIM on the dust grains produced by SNe II. We find that although
the grains ejected from SNe II are expected to be biased to large sizes ($a\ga
0.1 \micron$, where $a$ is the grain radius) because of the shock destruction
in supernova remnants, the shattering in WIM is efficient enough in $\sim 5$
Myr to produce small grains if the metallicity is nearly solar or more. The
production of small grains by shattering steepens the extinction curve. Thus,
steepening of extinction curves by shattering should always be taken into
account for the system where the metallicity is solar and the starburst age is
typically larger than 5 Myr. These conditions may be satisfied not only in
nearby starbursts but also in high redshift ($z>5$) quasars.

Hagedorn resonances on statistical models, which are used to describe hadronic
yields. Hagedorn states are relevant close to $T_c$ and have been shown to
decrease $\eta/s$ to the KSS limit and allow for quick chemical equilibrium
times in dynamical calculations of hadrons. The inclusion of Hagedorn states
creates a dependence of the thermal fits on the Hagedorn temperature, $T_H$,
which is assumed to be equal to $T_c$, and leads to an overall improvement of
thermal fits. We find that for Au+Au collisions at RHIC at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$
GeV the best square fit measure, $\chi^2$, occurs at $T_c \sim 176$ MeV and
produces a chemical freeze-out temperature of 170.4 MeV and a baryon chemical
potential of 27.8 MeV.

defined for p,q \ge 1, as |A|_{q->p} = max_{x !=0 } |Ax|_p / |x|_q. This is in
general a non-convex optimization problem, and is a natural generalization of
the well-studied question of computing singular values (this corresponds to
p=q=2). Different settings of parameters give rise to a variety of known
interesting problems (such as the Grothendieck problem when p=1 and q=\infty).
However, very little is understood about the approximability of the problem for
different values of p,q. Our first result is an efficient algorithm for
computing the q->p norm of matrices with non-negative entries, when q \ge p \ge
1. The algorithm we analyze is based on a natural fixed point iteration, which
can be seen as an analog of power iteration for computing eigenvalues. We then
present an application of our techniques to the problem of constructing a
scheme for oblivious routing in the l_p norm. This makes constructive a recent
existential result of Englert and R\""acke [ER] on O(log n)-competitive
oblivious routing schemes (which they make constructive only for p=2). On the
other hand, when we do not have any restrictions on the entries (such as
non-negativity), we prove that the problem is NP-hard to approximate to any
constant factor, for 2 < p \le q, and p \le q < 2 (these are precisely the
ranges of p,q with p\le q, where constant factor approximations are not known).
In this range, our techniques also show that if NP does not have
quasi-polynomial time algorithms, the q->p cannot be approximated to a factor
2^{(log n)^{1-eps}}, for any \eps>0.

distance. The third and most useful distance measure, earth mover's distance,
finds the best way of matching the terms and computes the distance
corresponding to this best matching. We develop lower bounds that can be
aggregated progressively and utilize them to speed up the search for top-k
object pairs when the earth mover's distance is used. For the minimum pairwise
distance, we devise an algorithm that runs in O(D + Tk log k) time, where D is

We also develop a novel best-first search strategy for the average pairwise
distance that utilizes lower bounds generated in an ordered manner. Experiments

time is elongated due to the enhanced electron heating and thus the
electron-phonon scattering in the presence of nonequilibrium phonons. The
frequency of spin precession, which is roughly proportional to the electron
drift velocity, can be either increased (at low electric field and/or high

that corresponds to the maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimates in
the case of a single data mode. MCE is not explicitly dependent on the noise
levels, scale factors or numbers of data points of the complementary data

from the boundary curves (profiles) and volumes (brightness values) of its
generalized projections.

analytical results including the local slope and curvature which are of first
importance, for instance, in beam mechanics. The presented VIC (Virtual Image

image of the fiber-like object and a virtual beam image, using an algorithm
close to the Digital Image Correlation method developed in experimental solid
mechanics. The computation only involves the part of the image in the vicinity
of the fiber: the method is thus insensitive to the picture background and the
computational cost remains low. Two examples are reported: the first proves the
precision of the method, the second its ability to identify a complex shape

our untriggered burst search on Fermi/GBM data (8-1000 keV) revealed ~450
bursts emitted over 24 hours during the peak of this activity. Using the GBM
data, we identified a ~150-s-long enhanced persistent emission during 2009

pulsations up to ~110 keV at the spin period of the neutron star, (ii) an
additional (to a power-law) blackbody component required for the enhanced

programme within the ESA Planck mission. The LFI instrument has been developed
to produce high precision maps of the microwave sky at frequencies in the range
27-77 GHz, below the peak of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation
spectrum. The scientific goals are described, ranging from fundamental
cosmology to Galactic and extragalactic astrophysics. The instrument design and
development are outlined, together with the model philosophy and testing
strategy. The instrument is presented in the context of the Planck mission. The
LFI approach to ground and inflight calibration is described. We also describe
the LFI ground segment. We present the results of a number of tests
demonstrating the capability of the LFI data processing centre (DPC) to
properly reduce and analyse LFI flight data, from telemetry information to
calibrated and cleaned time ordered data, sky maps at each frequency (in
temperature and polarization), component emission maps (CMB and diffuse
foregrounds), catalogs for various classes of sources (the Early Release
Compact Source Catalogue and the Final Compact Source Catalogue). The
organization of the LFI consortium is briefly presented as well as the role of
the core team in data analysis and scientific exploitation. All tests carried
out on the LFI flight model demonstrate the excellent performance of the
instrument and its various subunits. The data analysis pipeline has been tested
and its main steps verified. In the first three months after launch, the
commissioning, calibration, performance, and verification phases will be
completed, after which Planck will begin its operational life, in which LFI
will have an integral part.

motion is discussed.

subject of intensive research, particularly after recent demonstration that the
vortex polarity can be controlled by in-plane magnetic field. This has
stimulated the proposals of non-volatile vortex magnetic random access
memories. In this work, we demonstrate that triangular nanodots offer a real
alternative where vortex chirality, in addition to polarity, can be controlled.
In the static regime, we show that vortex chirality can be tailored by applying
in-plane magnetic field, which is experimentally imaged by means of
Variable-Field Magnetic Force Microscopy. In addition, the polarity can be also
controlled by applying a suitable out-of-plane magnetic field component. The
experiment and simulations show that to control the vortex polarity, the
out-of-plane field component, in this particular case, should be higher than
the in-plane nucleation field. Micromagnetic simulations in the dynamical
regime show that the magnetic vortex polarity can be changed with
short-duration magnetic field pulses, while longer pulses change the vortex
chirality.

collision theory. It is shown that for a closed system like the three-body (two

since in the high impact energy limit it transforms into an equation with two
independent time-like variables; the time appears in the stationary
Schroedinger equation as a result of extraction of a classical subsystem (two

checks on the most relevant aspects of a model and identify the target

sciences, the primary study data do not identify and may not even bound target
parameters. Discrepancies between target and analogous identified parameters
(biases) are then of paramount concern, which forces a major shift in modeling
strategies. Conventional approaches are based on conditional testing of
equality constraints, which correspond to implausible point-mass priors. When
these constraints are not identified by available data, however, no such
testing is possible. In response, implausible constraints can be relaxed into
penalty functions derived from plausible prior distributions. The resulting
models can be fit within familiar full or partial likelihood frameworks. The
absence of identification renders all analyses part of a sensitivity analysis.
In this view, results from single models are merely examples of what might be
plausibly inferred. Nonetheless, just one plausible inference may suffice to
demonstrate inherent limitations of the data. Points are illustrated with
misclassified data from a study of sudden infant death syndrome. Extensions to
confounding, selection bias and more complex data structures are outlined.

symmetry breaking, the origin of mass, the possible constituent of cold dark
matter, new sources of CP violation needed to explain the baryon excess in the
universe, the possible existence of extra gauge groups and extra matter, and
importantly the path Nature chooses to resolve the hierarchy problem - is it
supersymmetry or extra dimensions. Many models of new physics beyond the
standard model contain a hidden sector which can be probed at the LHC.
Additionally, the LHC will be a top factory and accurate measurements of the
properties of the top and its rare decays will provide a window to new physics.
Further, the LHC could shed light on the origin of neutralino masses if the new
physics associated with their generation lies in the TeV region. Finally, the
LHC is also a laboratory to test the hypothesis of TeV scale strings and
D-brane models. An overview of these possibilities is presented in the spirit

plane layers are modelled by tight-binding bands, and the electronic structure
is then calculated for a finite-thickness film. The dopant atoms are treated
within a virtual crystal approximation. Because YCBCO is a polar material,
self-consistent treatment of the long range Coulomb interaction leads to a
transfer of charge between the film surfaces, and to the formation of surface
states. The tight binding band parameters are constrained by the requirement
that the calculated band structure of surface states at CuO$_2$-terminated
surfaces be in agreement with photoemission experiments. The spectral function
and density of states are calculated and compared with experiments. Unlike the
case of Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8, where the surfaces are believed to be representative
of the bulk, the densities of states at the YCBCO surfaces are shown to be
qualitatively different from the bulk, and are sensitive to doping. The
calculated spectral function agrees closely with both bulk-sensitive and
surface-sensitive photoemission results, while the calculated density of states
for optimally-doped YCBCO agrees closely with tunneling experiments. We find

from factorizations of the distribution of longitudinal data and survival
information. Models are illustrated using cognitive functioning data for older
adults. For unconditional models, deaths do not occur, deaths are independent
of the longitudinal response, or the unconditional longitudinal response is
averaged over the survival distribution. Unconditional models, such as random
effects models fit to unbalanced data, may implicitly impute data beyond the
time of death. Fully conditional models stratify the longitudinal response
trajectory by time of death. Fully conditional models are effective for
describing individual trajectories, in terms of either aging (age, or years
from baseline) or dying (years from death). Causal models (principal
stratification) as currently applied are fully conditional models, since group
differences at one timepoint are described for a cohort that will survive past
a later timepoint. Partly conditional models summarize the longitudinal
response in the dynamic cohort of survivors. Partly conditional models are
serial cross-sectional snapshots of the response, reflecting the average
response in survivors at a given timepoint rather than individual trajectories.
Joint models of survival and longitudinal response describe the evolving health
status of the entire cohort. Researchers using longitudinal data should
consider which method of accommodating deaths is consistent with research aims,
and use analysis methods accordingly.

fermion field with a non-minimal Lagrangian is performed without any
restriction on the local Lorentz frame. It is outlined that the phase space
structure does not resemble that one of a background independent Lorentz gauge
theory, as some additional constraints are present. Proper phase space
coordinates are introduced, such that SU(2) connections can be defined and the
vanishing of conjugate momenta to boost variables is predicted. Finally, it is
demonstrated that for a particular value of the non-minimal parameter the
kinematics coincides with that one of a background independent SU(2) gauge
theory and the Immirzi parameter becomes the coupling constant of such an
interaction between fermions and the gravitational field.

Galaxies (BCGs) and normal ellipticals (Es) in our sample of 75 galaxy clusters

galaxies. The sample of cDs has been completed by 14 additional cDs (non-BCGs)
we found in our clusters. We find that: (i) Es have triaxial shape, the
triaxiality sharing almost evenly the intrinsic axial ratios parameter space,
with a weak preference for prolateness; (ii) the BCGs have triaxial shape as
well. However, their tendence towards prolateness is much stronger than in the
case of Es. Such a strong prolateness appears entirely due to the sizeable
(dominant) component of cDs inside the WINGS sample of BCGs. In fact, while the
'normal'(non-cD) BCGs do not differ from Es, as far as the shape distribution
is concerned, the axial ratio distribution of BCG_cD galaxies is found to
support quite prolate shapes; (iii) our result turns out to be strongly at
variance with the only similar, previous analysis by Ryden et al.(1993)(RLP93),
where BCGs and Es were found to share the same axial ratio distribution; (iv)
our data suggest that the above discrepancy is mainly caused by the different
criteria that RLP93 and ourselves use to select the cluster samples, coupled
with a preference of cDs to reside in powerful X-ray emitting clusters; (v) the
GIF2 N-body results suggest that the prolateness of the BCGs (in particular the
cDs) could reflect the shape of the associated dark matter halos.

introduced, generalizing classical kernel methods. The new learning methodology
provide a formal connection between computational architectures with multiple
layers and the theme of kernel learning in standard regularization methods.
First, a representer theorem for two-layer networks is presented, showing that
finite linear combinations of kernels on each layer are optimal architectures
whenever the corresponding functions solve suitable variational problems in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The input-output map expressed by
these architectures turns out to be equivalent to a suitable single-layer
kernel machines in which the kernel function is also learned from the data.
Recently, the so-called multiple kernel learning methods have attracted
considerable attention in the machine learning literature. In this paper,
multiple kernel learning methods are shown to be specific cases of kernel
machines with two layers in which the second layer is linear. Finally, a simple
and effective multiple kernel learning method called RLS2 (regularized least
squares with two layers) is introduced, and his performances on several
learning problems are extensively analyzed. An open source MATLAB toolbox to
train and validate RLS2 models with a Graphic User Interface is available.

Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 279. The spectrum shows evidence of both broad and narrow
emission features. The Fe K alpha line may be equally well explained by a
single broad Gaussian (FWHM~10,000 km/s) or by two components: an unresolved
core plus a very broad profile (FWHM~14,000 km/s). For the first time we
quantified, via the ""locally optimally emitting cloud"" model, the contribution
of the broad line region (BLR) to the absolute luminosity of the broad
component of the Fe K alpha at 6.4 keV. We find that the contribution of the
BLR is only ~3%. In the two-line component scenario, we also evaluated the
contribution of the highly ionized gas component, which produces the FeXXVI
line in the iron K region. This contribution to the narrow core of the Fe K
alpha line is marginal <0.1%. Most of the luminosity of the unresolved,
component of Fe K alpha may come from the obscuring torus, while the very-broad
associated component may come from the accretion disk. However, models of
reflection by cold gas are difficult to test because of the limited energy
band. The FeXXVI line at 6.9 keV is consistent to be produced in a high column
density (N_H~10^23 cm^{-2}), extremely ionized (log\xi~5.5-7) gas. This gas may
be a highly ionized outer layer of the torus.
