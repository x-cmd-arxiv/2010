alkaline halide crystal produced by both positive and negative ions is in good

taken separately are not ``good'' quantum numbers. Specifically, we consider a
uniform system with non-zero magnetization at zero temperature. Assuming the
magnetization is along $z$-axis, the quantum spin states are $\v{k}$-dependent
linear combinations of eigenstates of the $\sigma_z$ Pauli matrix. This leads
to novel spin structures in \textit{momentum space} and to the fact that the
Fermi surfaces for ``up'' and ``down'' spins are not well defined. The system
still has a cylindrical axis of symmetry along the magnetization axis. We also
show that the self energy has a universal structure which we determine based on
the symmetries of the dipolar interaction and we explicitly calculated it in
the Hartree-Fock approximation. We show that the bare magnetic moment of
particles is renormalized due to particle-particle interactions and we give

massive sources, and steeper spectra in higher accretion rate systems. The
predicted values of the photon index cover the range of spectral slopes
typically observed in Seyfert galaxies and quasars. The overall trends are
consistent with observations, and may account for the positive correlation of
the photon index with Eddington ratio (and the possible anticorrelation with
black hole mass) observed in different AGN samples. Spectral properties are
also closely related to variability properties. We obtain that shorter
characteristic time scales are associated with steeper spectra. This agrees
with the observed `spectral-timing' correlation.

processes. Rc^{it}(D) is a lower bound to the optimal performance theoretically

for Gaussian sources, the latter can also be upper bounded as Rc^{op}(D)\leq
Rc^{it}(D) + 0.5 log_{2}(2\pi e) bits/sample. In order to analyze
$R_{c}^{it}(D)$ for arbitrary zero-mean Gaussian stationary sources, we
introduce \bar{Rc^{it}}(D), the information-theoretic causal RDF when the
reconstruction error is jointly stationary with the source. Based upon
\bar{Rc^{it}}(D), we derive three closed-form upper bounds to the additive rate
loss defined as \bar{Rc^{it}}(D) - R(D), where R(D) denotes Shannon's RDF. Two
of these bounds are strictly smaller than 0.5 bits/sample at all rates. These
bounds differ from one another in their tightness and ease of evaluation; the
tighter the bound, the more involved its evaluation. We then show that, for any

\bar{Rc^{it}}(D) can be realized by an AWGN channel surrounded by a unique set
of causal pre-, post-, and feedback filters. We show that finding such filters

which act isometrically on $H^2\ominus uH^2$. Hayashi obtained the link between
the symbol $\phii$ of a Toeplitz operator and the functions $g$ and $u$ to
ensure that a given subspace $\FF=gK_u$ is the kernel of $T_\phii$. Chalendar,
Chevrot and Partington studied the nearly $S^*$-invariant subspaces for
vector-valued functions. In this paper, we investigate the generalization of
Sarason's and Hayashi's results in the vector-valued context.

topological charge distribution in the vacuum is dominated by thin coherent
membranes of codimension one arranged in a layered, alternating-sign sandwich.
A similar lamination of topological charge occurs in the 2D $CP^{N-1}$ model.
In holographic QCD, the observed topological charge sheets are naturally
interpreted as $D6$ branes wrapped around an $S_4$.. With this interpretation,
the laminated array of topological charge membranes observed on the lattice can
be identified as a ""tachyonic crystal"", a regular, alternating-sign array of
$D6$ and $\bar{D6}$ branes that arises as the final state of the decay of a
non-BPS $D7$ brane via the tachyonic mode of the attached string. In the gauge
theory, the homogeneous, space-filling $D7$ brane represents the perturbative
gauge vacuum, which is unstable toward lamination associated with a marginal
tachyonic boundary perturbation $\propto \cos(X/\sqrt{2\alpha'})$. For the
$CP^{N-1}$ model, the cutoff field theory can be cast as the low energy limit
of an open string theory in background gauge and tachyon fields $A_{\mu}(x)$
and $\lambda(x)$. This allows a detailed comparison with large $N$ field theory
results and provides strong support for the tachyonic crystal interpretation of
the gauge theory vacuum.

The observed variation of the velocity can be understood to reflect the degree

by changing the distance between the gate and the edge channel with the gate

found that the dynamics of community assembly with mutations are quite
different from the case with migrations. In contrast to mutation models, which
show intermittent dynamics of quasi-steady states interrupted by sudden
reorganizations of the community, migration models show smooth and gradual
renewal of the community. As a consequence, instead of the $1/f$ diversity
fluctuations found for the mutation models, $1/f^2$, random-walk like
fluctuations are observed for the migration models. In addition, a
characteristic species-lifetime distribution is found: a power law that is cut
off by a ""skewed"" distribution in the long-lifetime regime. The latter has a
longer tail than a simple exponential function, which indicates an
age-dependent species-mortality function. Since this characteristic profile has
been observed, both in fossil data and in several other mathematical models, we

aim to obtain the exact solutions to the global mean first-passage time

over the whole family of fractals. Based on the known connections between FPTs,
effective resistance, and the eigenvalues of graph Laplacian, we determine

results. The obtained closed-form solution shows that the GMFPT approximately
grows as a power-law function with system size (number of all nodes), with the
exponent lies between 1 and 2. We then provide both the upper bound and lower
bound for GMFPT of general trees, and show that leading behavior of the upper
bound is the square of system size and the dominating scaling of the lower
bound varies linearly with system size. We also show that the upper bound can

demonstrate that the bulk silicate Earth and the Moon show an unexpectedly high
degree of similarity. This is inconsistent with one of the primary results of
classic dynamical simulations of the widely accepted giant impact model for the
formation of the Moon, namely that most of the mass of the Moon originates from
the impactor, not Earth.
  Resolution of this discrepancy without changing the main premises of the
giant impact model requires total isotopic homogenisation of Earth and impactor
material after the impact for a wide range of elements including O, Si, K, Ti,
Nd and W. Even if this process could explain the O isotope similarity, it is
unlikely to work for the much heavier, refractory elements. Given the
increasing uncertainty surrounding the giant impact model in light of these
geochemical data, alternative hypotheses for lunar formation should be
explored. In this paper, we revisit the hypothesis that the Moon was formed
directly from terrestrial mantle material. We show that the dynamics of this
scenario requires a large amount of energy, almost instantaneously generated
additional energy. The only known source for this additional energy is nuclear
fission. We show that it is feasible to form the Moon through the ejection of
terrestrial silicate material triggered by a nuclear explosion at Earths
core-mantle boundary (CMB), causing a shock wave propagating through the Earth.
Hydrodynamic modelling of this scenario shows that a shock wave created by
rapidly expanding plasma resulting from the explosion disrupts and expels
overlying mantle and crust material.

eukaryotes. Besides its role in transcriptional regulation, chromatin loops
have been proposed to play a pivotal role in the segregation of entire
chromosomes. The detailed topological and entropic forces between loops still
remain elusive. Here, we quantitatively determine the potential of mean force
between the centers of mass of two ring polymers, i.e. loops. We find that the
transition from a linear to a ring polymer induces a strong increase in the
entropic repulsion between these two polymers. On top, topological interactions
such as the non-catenation constraint further reduce the number of accessible
conformations of close-by ring polymers by about 50%, resulting in an
additional effective repulsion. Furthermore, the transition from linear to ring
polymers displays changes in the conformational and structural properties of
the system. In fact, ring polymers adopt a markedly more ordered and aligned
state than linear ones. The forces and accompanying changes in shape and
alignment between ring polymers suggest an important regulatory function of
such a topology in biopolymers. We conjecture that dynamic loop formation in
chromatin might act as a versatile control mechanism regulating and maintaining
different local states of compaction and order.

oscillator in terms of pure and mixed states. We have found a significant
difference between a quantum and a classical oscillator. In particular, the
energy of a classical oscillator will always be dissipated by the electrons

useful insight for the design of experiments aimed at studying the quantum
