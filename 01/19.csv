system do not necessarily know when a computation is globally finished. This
paper investigates the problem of the detection of the termination of local

detection of the local termination, detection by a distributed observer,
detection of the global termination. We give a complete characterisation
(except in the local termination detection case where a partial one is given)
for each of this termination detection and show that they define a strict
hierarchy. These results emphasise the difference between computability of a
distributed task and termination detection. Furthermore, these
characterisations encompass all standard criteria that are usually formulated :
topological restriction (tree, rings, or triangu- lated networks ...),
topological knowledge (size, diameter ...), and local knowledge to distinguish
nodes (identities, sense of direction). These results are now presented as
corollaries of generalising theorems. As a very special and important case, the
techniques are also applied to the election problem. Though given in the model
of local computations, these results can give qualitative insight for similar
results in other standard models. The necessary conditions involve graphs
covering and quasi-covering; the sufficient conditions (constructive local
computations) are based upon an enumeration algorithm of Mazurkiewicz and a
stable properties detection algorithm of Szymanski, Shi and Prywes.

the emission line galaxies were classified as pure AGNs, 23% as Transition
Objects (TOs) and 32% as Star Forming Nuclei (SFNs). In the HCGs, the AGN
activity appears as the most frequent activity type. Adopting the
interpretation that in TOs a Low Luminosity AGN coexists with circumnuclear
star formation, the fraction of galaxies with an AGN could rise to 42% of the
whole sample. The low frequency (20%) of SFNs confirms that there is no star
formation enhancement in HCGs. After extinction correction we found a median
AGN H$\alpha$ luminosity of 7.1$\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which implies that
AGNs in HCG have a characteristically low luminosity. This result added to the
fact, that there is an almost complete absence of Broad Line AGNs in Compact
Groups (CGs) as found by Martinez et al.(2008a) and corroborated in this study
for HCGs, is consistent with very few gas left in these galaxies. In general,
therefore, what may characterize the level of activity in CGs is a severe
deficiency of gas.

its structure world is continuous, though can be discretized into structural
alphabets (SA). In order to reveal the relationship between sequence and
structure, it is interesting to consider both AA and SA in a joint space.
However, such space has too many parameters, so the reduction of AA is
necessary to bring down the parameter numbers.
  Result: We've developed a simple but effective approach called entropic
clustering based on selecting the best mutual information between a given
reduction of AAs and SAs. The optimized reduction of AA into two groups leads
to hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Combined with our SA, namely conformational
letter (CL) of 17 alphabets, we get a joint alphabet called hydropathy
conformational letter (hp-CL). A joint substitution matrix with (17*2)*(17*2)
indices is derived from FSSP. Moreover, we check the three coding systems, say
AA, CL and hp-CL against a large database consisting proteins from family to
fold, with their performance on the TopK accuracy of both similar fragment pair
(SFP) and the neighbor of aligned fragment pair (AFP). The TopK selection is
according to the score calculated by the coding system's substitution matrix.
Finally, embedding hp-CL in a pairwise alignment algorithm, say CLeFAPS, to
replace the original CL, will get an improvement on the HOMSTRAD benchmark.

relationship between the large- and small-scale activity. The shape of the
dominant large-scale structure is investigated by conditional averages based on
the large-scale velocity, determined using a filter width equal to the channel

times the filter width, and the small-scale--large-scale relative phase
difference increases away from the wall, passing through $\pi/2$ in the overlap

shell, containing no matter, arises as a boundary between two regions of the
space-time. Such solutions are a generalized kind of spherically symmetric
empty space solutions, described by metric functions of the class $C^0$. New
global structures arise with surprising features. In particular, we show that
vacuum spherically symmetric wormholes do exist in this theory. These can be
regarded as gravitational solitons, which connect two asymptotically (Anti)
de-Sitter spaces with different masses and/or different effective cosmological
constants. We prove the existence of both static and dynamical solutions and
discuss their (in)stability under perturbations that preserve the symmetry.

added to the undoped state form pairs, presumably a precursor of a

limit, our investigations show a robust $(\pi,0)$ antiferromagnetic ground
state, as in previous investigations. Doping away from $\rho=2$ and for large
values of the Hund coupling $J$, a ferromagnetic region is found to be stable.
Moreover, when the interorbital on-site Hubbard repulsion is smaller than the
Hund coupling, i.e. for $U'<J$ in the standard notation of multiorbital Hubbard
models, our results indicate the coexistence of pairing tendencies and
ferromagnetism close to $\rho=2$. These results are compatible with previous
investigations using one dimensional systems. Although further research is
needed to clarify if the range of couplings used here is of relevance for real
materials, such as superconducting heavy fermions or pnictides, our theoretical
results address a possible mechanism for pairing that may be active in the

Inclusion of sub-dominant signal harmonics in the inspiral signal allows for
high-accuracy sky localization, dramatically improving the chances of finding
the host galaxy and obtaining its redshift. A SMBBH merger can potentially have
component masses from a wide range ($10^5 - 10^8\,\Ms$) over which parameter
accuracies vary considerably. We perform an in-depth study in order to

investigate how accuracies on all parameters improve when a knowledge of the

be measured to within a few percent in most cases, if the only error in
measuring the luminosity distance is due to LISA's instrumental noise and the
confusion background from Galactic binaries. However, weak lensing-induced
errors will severely degrade the accuracy with which $w$ can be obtained,
emphasizing that methods to mitigate weak lensing effects would be required to
take advantage of LISA's full potential.

fluctuations in turbulent pipe flow is presented and used to illuminate the
scaling behaviour of the very large scale motions. The model is derived by
treating the nonlinearity in the perturbation equation (involving the Reynolds
stress) as an unknown forcing, yielding a linear relationship between the
velocity field response and this nonlinearity. We do not assume small
perturbations. We examine propagating modes, permitting comparison of our
results to experimental data, and identify the steady component of the velocity
field that varies only in the wall-normal direction as the turbulent mean
profile. The ""optimal"" forcing shape, that gives the largest velocity response,
is assumed to lead to modes that will be dominant and hence observed in
turbulent pipe flow.
  An investigation of the most amplified velocity response at a given
wavenumber-frequency combination reveals critical layer-like behaviour
reminiscent of the neutrally stable solutions of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation in
linearly unstable flow. Two distinct regions in the flow where the influence of
viscosity becomes important can be identified, namely a wall layer that scales
with $R^{+1/2}$ and a critical layer, where the propagation velocity is equal
to the local mean velocity, that scales with $R^{+2/3}$ in pipe flow. This
framework appears to be consistent with several scaling results in wall
turbulence and reveals a mechanism by which the effects of viscosity can extend
well beyond the immediate vicinity of the wall.

genotypic and phenotypic diversity. We analyze a model of viral competition
between two different viral strains infecting a constantly replenished cell
pool, in which we assume a trade-off between the virus' colonization skills
(cell killing ability or virulence) and its local competition skills
(replication performance within coinfected cells). We characterize the
conditions that allow for viral spread by means of the basic reproductive
number and show that a local coexistence equilibrium exists, which is
asymptotically stable. At this equilibrium, the less virulent competitor has a
reproductive advantage over the more virulent colonizer. The equilibria at
which one strain outcompetes the other one are unstable, i.e., a second viral
strain is always able to permanently invade. One generalization of the model is
to consider multiple viral strains, each one displaying a different virulence.
However, to account for the large phenotypic diversity in viral populations, we
consider a continuous spectrum of virulences and present a continuum limit of
this multiple viral strains model that describes the time evolution of an
initial continuous distribution of virulence. We provide a proof of the
existence of solutions of the model's equations and present numerical
approximations of solutions for different initial distributions. Our
simulations suggest that initial continuous distributions of virulence evolve
towards a stationary distribution that is extremely skewed in favor of
competitors. Consequently, collective virulence attenuation takes place. This
finding may contribute to understanding the phenomenon of virulence
attenuation, which has been reported in previous experimental studies.

the different opposite spin levels approaches. We find that the current as a
function of the external magnetic field shows a peak or a dip, and that the
transition from a current dip to a current peak behaviour is obtained by
decreasing the hyperfine coupling or by increasing the interdot tunnelling
strength. We give a physical picture in terms of the interplay between the

(2007)] has been successfully applied to model the experimentally measured
broadband optical absorption for ternary nanocomposites containing alloys or
mixtures of two metals (from Ag, Au or Cu) in SiO dielectric. In this work we
present the broadband optical behavior of important optical coating dielectrics
(SiN and SiO) and photocatalyst (TiO) containing various configuration of
nanoparticles of Al, Au, Ag, or Cu. The spectral behavior of various
combinations of the metallic species in the dielectrics was optimized to show
either broadband solar absorption or strong multiple plasmonic absorption
peaks. The applications of such nanocomposite materials in solar energy
harvesting and spectral sensing are also presented and discussed.

massive cluster, as predicted by hydrodynamical SPH simulations and by a
semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation. Both models include gas cooling
and a simple prescription of star formation, which consists in transforming
instantaneously any cold gas available into stars, while neglecting any source
of energy feedback. We find that, in general, galaxy populations from SAMs and
SPH have similar statistical properties, in agreement with previous studies.
However, when comparing galaxies on an object-by-object basis, we find a number
of interesting differences: a) the star formation histories of the brightest
cluster galaxies (BCGs) from SAM and SPH models differ significantly, with the
SPH BCG exhibiting a lower level of star formation activity at low redshift,
and a more intense and shorter initial burst of star formation with respect to
its SAM counterpart; b) while all stars associated with the BCG were formed in
its progenitors in the semi-analytic model used here, this holds true only for
half of the final BCG stellar mass in the SPH simulation, the remaining half
being contributed by tidal stripping of stars from the diffuse stellar
component associated with galaxies accreted on the cluster halo; c) SPH
satellites can loose up to 90 per cent of their stellar mass at the time of
accretion, due to tidal stripping, a process not included in the semi-analytic
model used in this study; d) in the SPH simulation, significant cooling occurs
on the most massive satellite galaxies and this lasts for up to 1 Gyr after
accretion. This physical process is not included in the semi-analytic model
used in our study, as well as in most of the models discussed in the recent
literature.

azimuthal radially symmetric expansion, we discovered a bulk motion of the

is to understand the SEDs of AGN in the optical/UV to X-ray regime and to
provide bolometric corrections which are important in determining the Eddington
ratio L/Ledd. In particular, we rigorously explore the dependence of the UV-EUV
contribution to the bolometric correction on the assumed EUV spectral shape. We
find strong correlations of the spectral slopes alpha-x and alpha-UV with
L/Ledd. Although Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) have steeper alpha-x
and higher L/Ledd than Broad-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (BLS1s), their optical/UV
to X-ray spectral slopes alpha-ox and optical/UV slopes alpha-UV are very
similar. The mean SED of NLS1s shows that in general this type of AGN appears
to be fainter in the UV and at hard X-ray energies than BLS1s. We find a strong
correlation between alpha-x and alpha-UV for AGN with X-ray spectral slopes
alpha-x<1.6. For AGN with steeper X-ray spectra, both this relation and the
relation between alpha-x and L/Ledd break down. At alpha-x$\approx$1.6, L/Ledd
reaches unity. We note an offset in the alpha-UV - L/Ledd relation between
NLS1s and BLS1s. We argue that alpha-UV is a good estimator of L/Ledd and
suggest that alpha-UV can be used to estimate L/Ledd in high-redshift QSOs.
Although NLS1s appear to be highly variable in X-rays they only vary marginally
in the UV.

stellar mass and morphology. We find that black hole growth at luminosities
L_OIII >1E40 erg/s in early- and late-type galaxies is fundamentally different.
AGN host galaxies as a population have a broad range of stellar masses
(1E10-1E11 Msun), reside in the green valley of the color-mass diagram and
their central black holes have median masses around 1E6.5 Msun. However, by
comparing early- and late-type AGN host galaxies to their non-active
counterparts, we find several key differences: in early-type galaxies, it is
preferentially the galaxies with the least massive black holes that are
growing, while late-type galaxies, it is preferentially the most massive}black
holes that are growing. The duty cycle of AGN in early-type galaxies is
strongly peaked in the green valley below the low-mass end (1E10 Msun) of the
red sequence at stellar masses where there is a steady supply of blue cloud
progenitors. The duty cycle of AGN in late-type galaxies on the other hand
peaks in massive (1E11 Msun) green and red late-types which generally do not
have a corresponding blue cloud population of similar mass. At high Eddington
ratios (L/L_Edd > 0.1), the only population with a substantial fraction of AGN
are the low-mass green valley early-type galaxies. Finally, the Milky Way
likely resides in the ""sweet spot"" on the color-mass diagram where the AGN duty
cycle of late-type galaxies is highest. We discuss the implications of these
results for our understanding of the role of AGN in the evolution of galaxies

validate spectroscopic effective temperature scales, whereas for [Fe/H]<-2.5

to the Balmer lines and 200 K hotter than those obtained from the excitation

formation of nonlinear large-scale structure, and how the different couplings
of the scalar field to baryons and CDM particles lead to different
distributions and evolutions for these two matter species, both on large scales

in regions where the fifth force is strong, and little segregation in dense
regions. We also introduce an approximation method to identify the virialized
halos in coupled scalar field models which takes into account the scalar field
coupling and which is easy to implement numerically. It is find that the
chameleon nature of the scalar field makes the internal density profiles of

handful of individually resolvable signals that raise above the background
level and are produced by sources sufficiently close and/or massive.
Considering a wide range of massive black hole binary assembly scenarios, we
investigate both the level and shape of the background and the statistics of
resolvable sources. We predict a characteristic background amplitude in the
interval h_c(f = 10^-8 Hz)~5*10^-16 - 5*10^-15, within the detection range of
the complete Parkes PTA. We also quantify the capability of PTAs of measuring
the parameters of individual sources, focusing on monochromatic signals
produced by binaries in circular orbit. We investigate how the results depend
on the number and distribution of pulsars in the array, by computing the
variance-covariance matrix of the parameter measurements. For plausible Square
Kilometre Array (SKA) observations (100 pulsars uniformly distributed in the

massive black hole binaries can be located within a ~40deg^2 error box, opening
promising prospects for detecting a putative electromagnetic counterpart to the
gravitational wave emission. The planned SKA, can plausibly observe these
unique systems, although the number of detections is likely to be small.

AGNs. It has been suggested that accretion in LLAGNs occurs via an
advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) associated with strong jets. In order
to probe the accretion physics in LLAGNs as a class, we model the
multiwavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 24 LINERs (taken from a
recent compilation by Eracleous et al.) with a coupled accretion-jet model. The
accretion flow is modeled as an inner ADAF outside of which there is a
truncated standard thin disk. These SEDs include radio, near-IR to near-UV HST
data, and Chandra X-ray data. We find that the radio emission is severely
underpredicted by ADAF models but can be explained by the relativistic jet. The
origin of the X-ray radiation in most sources can be explained by three
distinct scenarios: the X-rays can be dominated by emission from the ADAF, the
jet, or from both components contributing at similar levels. From the model
fits, we estimate important parameters of the central engine of LINERs, such as
the mass accretion rate -- relevant for studies of the feeding of AGNs -- and
the mass-loss rate in the jet and the jet power -- relevant for studies of the

as two external shocks including the legality debate of the auction in 2004 and
the auction regime reform in January 2008 on the average price $P_{\rm{mean}}$

marginal transient impact on the average price in a short time period. In
contrast, the change of the auction rules has significant permanent influence
on the average price, which reduces the price by about 3020 yuan Renminbi. It
means that the average price exhibits nonlinear behaviors with a regime change.
The evolution of the average price is independent of the number
$N_{\rm{bidder}}$ of bidders in both regimes. In the early regime before
January 2008, the average price $P_{\rm{mean}}$ was influenced only by the
minimal price $P_{\min}$ in the preceding month with a positive correlation. In
the current regime since January 2008, the average price is positively
correlated with the minimal price and the quota in the preceding month and
negatively correlated with the quota in the same month. We test the predictive
power of the two models using 2-year and 3-year moving windows and find that
the latter outperforms the former. It seems that the auction market becomes
more efficient after the auction reform since the prediction error increases.

physicists as the 'axion' field and whether or not it has a nonzero expectation
value in vacuum remains a fundamental open question of the Standard Model. A
key manifestation of the axion term is the Witten effect: a unit magnetic
monopole placed inside a medium with non-zero theta is predicted to bind a
(generally fractional) electric charge -e(theta/2 pi+n) with n integer. Here we
conduct a first test of the Witten effect, based on the recently established
fact that the axion term with theta=pi emerges naturally in the description of
the electromagnetic response of a new class of crystalline solids called
topological insulators - materials distinguished by strong spin-orbit coupling
and non-trivial band structure. Using a simple physical model for a topological
insulator, we demonstrate the existence of a fractional charge bound to a
monopole by an explicit numerical calculation. We also propose a scheme for
generating an 'artificial' magnetic monopole in a topological insulator film,

information diffusion. However, due to its unique complexity, the mechanism of
the diffusion in online social networks is different from the ones in other
types of networks and remains unclear to us. Meanwhile, few works have been
done to reveal the coupled dynamics of both the structure and the diffusion of
online social networks. To this end, in this paper, we propose a model to
investigate how the structure is coupled with the diffusion in online social
networks from the view of weak ties. Through numerical experiments on
large-scale online social networks, we find that in contrast to some previous
research results, selecting weak ties preferentially to republish cannot make
the information diffuse quickly, while random selection can achieve this goal.
However, when we remove the weak ties gradually, the coverage of the
information will drop sharply even in the case of random selection. We also
give a reasonable explanation for this by extra analysis and experiments.
Finally, we conclude that weak ties play a subtle role in the information
diffusion in online social networks. On one hand, they act as bridges to
connect isolated local communities together and break through the local
trapping of the information. On the other hand, selecting them as preferential
paths to republish cannot help the information spread further in the network.
As a result, weak ties might be of use in the control of the virus spread and
the private information diffusion in real-world applications.

hemispheres may evolve separately throughout the solar cycle. The observed
phase lag between the hemispheres provides information regarding the strength
of hemispheric coupling. Using hemispheric sunspot-area and sunspot-number data
from Cycles 12 - 23, we determine how out of phase the separate hemispheres are
during the rising, maximum, and declining period of each solar cycle.
Hemispheric phase differences range from 0 - 11, 0 - 14, and 2 - 19 months for
the rising, maximum, and declining periods, respectively. The phases appear
randomly distributed between zero months (in phase) and half of the rise (or
decline) time of the solar cycle. An analysis of the Gnevyshev gap is conducted
to determine if the double-peak is caused by the averaging of two hemispheres
that are out of phase. We confirm previous findings that the Gnevyshev gap is a
phenomenon that occurs in the separate hemispheres and is not due to a
superposition of sunspot indices from hemispheres slightly out of phase. Cross
hemispheric coupling could be strongest at solar minimum, when there are large
quantities of magnetic flux at the Equator. We search for a correlation between
the hemispheric phase difference near the end of the solar cycle and the length
of solar-cycle minimum, but found none. Because magnetic flux diffusion across
the Equator is a mechanism by which the hemispheres couple, we measured the
magnetic flux crossing the Equator by examining magnetograms for Solar Cycles
21 - 23. We find, on average, a surplus of northern hemisphere magnetic flux
crossing during the mid-declining phase of each solar cycle. However, we find
no correlation between magnitude of magnetic flux crossing the Equator, length
of solar minima, and phase lag between the hemispheres.

  Resources Research Institute Final Report 2009",,,,"math.NA math.AP physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Groundwater flow in Washington DC greatly influences the surface water
quality in urban areas. The current methods of flow estimation, based on
Darcy's Law and the groundwater flow equation, can be described by the
diffusion equation (the transient flow) and the Laplace equation (the
steady-state flow). The Laplace equation is a simplification of the diffusion
equation under the condition that the aquifer has a recharging boundary. The
practical way of calculation is to use numerical methods to solve these
equations. The most popular system is called MODFLOW, which was developed by
USGS. MODFLOW is based on the finite-difference method in rectangular Cartesian
coordinates. MODFLOW can be viewed as a ""quasi 3D"" simulation since it only
deals with the vertical average (no z-direction derivative). Flow calculations
between the 2D horizontal layers use the concept of leakage. In this project,
we have established a mathematical model based on gradually varied functions
for groundwater data volume reconstruction. These functions do not rely on the
rectangular Cartesian coordinate system. A gradually varied function can be
defined in a general graph or network. Gradually varied functions are suitable
for arbitrarily shaped aquifers. Two types of models are designed and
implemented for real data processing: (1) the gradually varied model for
individual (time) groundwater flow data, (2) the gradually varied model for
sequential (time) groundwater flow data. In application, we also established a
MySQL database to support the related research. The advantage of the gradually
varied fitting and its related method does not need the strictly defined
boundary condition as it is required in MODFLOW.

communications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) which aims at increasing the
transmission range in the network by radiating the power from a cluster of
sensor nodes in the directions of the intended base station(s) or access
point(s) (BSs/APs). The CB average beampattern expresses a deterministic
behavior and can be used for characterizing/controling the transmission at
intended direction(s), since the mainlobe of the CB beampattern is independent
on the particular random node locations. However, the CB for a cluster formed
by a limited number of collaborative nodes results in a sample beampattern with
sidelobes that severely depend on the particular node locations. High level
sidelobes can cause unacceptable interference when they occur at directions of
unintended BSs/APs. Therefore, sidelobe control in CB has a potential to
increase the network capacity and wireless channel availability by decreasing
the interference. Traditional sidelobe control techniques are proposed for
centralized antenna arrays and, therefore, are not suitable for WSNs. In this
paper, we show that distributed, scalable, and low-complexity sidelobe control
techniques suitable for CB in WSNs can be developed based on node selection
technique which make use of the randomness of the node locations. A node
selection algorithm with low-rate feedback is developed to search over
different node combinations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is
analyzed in terms of the average number of trials required to select the
collaborative nodes and the resulting interference. Our simulation results
approve the theoretical analysis and show that the interference is
significantly reduced when node selection is used with CB.

insulators (TI) has generated intense interest in this new state of quantum

Bi_2Se_3 and Sb_2Te_3 consist of a single massless Dirac cones. Crossing of the
two surface state branches with opposite spins in the materials is fully
protected by the time reversal (TR) symmetry at the Dirac points, which cannot
be destroyed by any TR invariant perturbation. Recent advances in thin-film
growth have permitted this unique two-dimensional electron system (2DES) to be

intriguing TR symmetry protected topological states were revealed in STM
experiments where the backscattering induced by non-magnetic impurities was
forbidden. Here we report the Landau quantization of the topological surface
states in Bi_2Se_3 in magnetic field by using STM/STS. The direct observation
of the discrete Landau levels (LLs) strongly supports the 2D nature of the
topological states and gives direct proof of the nondegenerate structure of LLs
in TI. We demonstrate the linear dispersion of the massless Dirac fermions by
the square-root dependence of LLs on magnetic field. The formation of LLs
implies the high mobility of the 2DES, which has been predicted to lead to

inhomogeneous electric field which switches between two configurations. For the
decelerator to work, it is essential that the molecules follow the changing
electric field adiabatically. When the decelerator switches from one
configuration to the other, the electric field changes in magnitude and
direction, and this can cause molecules to change state. In places where the
field is weak, the rotation of the electric field vector during the switch may
be too rapid for the molecules to maintain their orientation relative to the
field. Molecules that are at these places when the field switches may be lost
from the decelerator as they are transferred into states that are not focussed.
We calculate the probability of nonadiabatic transitions as a function of
position in the periodic decelerator structure and find that for the
decelerated group of molecules the loss is typically small, while for the
un-decelerated group of molecules the loss can be very high. This loss can be
eliminated using a bias field to ensure that the electric field magnitude is
always large enough. We demonstrate our findings by comparing the results of
experiments and simulations for the Stark deceleration of LiH and CaF
molecules. We present a simple method for calculating the transition
probabilities which can easily be applied to other molecules of interest.

$n$-node network, our algorithms guarantee that all the nodes can compute the
common aggregates (such as Min, Max, Count, Sum, Average, Rank etc.) of their
values in optimal $O(\log n)$ time and using $O(n \log \log n)$ messages. Our
result improves on the algorithm of Kempe et al. \cite{kempe} that is
time-optimal, but uses $O(n \log n)$ messages as well as on the algorithm of
Kashyap et al. \cite{efficient-gossip} that uses $O(n \log \log n)$ messages,
but is not time-optimal (takes $O(\log n \log \log n)$ time). Furthermore, we
show that our algorithms can be used to improve gossip-based aggregate
computation in sparse communication networks, such as in peer-to-peer networks.
  The main technical ingredient of our algorithm is a technique called {\em
distributed random ranking (DRR)} that can be useful in other applications as
well. DRR gives an efficient distributed procedure to partition the network
into a forest of (disjoint) trees of small size.
  Our algorithms are non-address oblivious. In contrast, we show a lower bound
of $\Omega(n\log n)$ on the message complexity of any address-oblivious
algorithm for computing aggregates. This shows that non-address oblivious
algorithms are needed to obtain significantly better message complexity. Our
lower bound holds regardless of the number of rounds taken or the size of the
messages used. Our lower bound is the first non-trivial lower bound for
gossip-based aggregate computation and also gives the first formal proof that
computing aggregates is strictly harder than rumor spreading in the

enhanced learning as a result of heightened affect.
  The cortex biases neuronal responses to affect both learning and memory,
through the use of diffuse projections from the limbic system to the cortex.
Standard ANNs do not model this non-local flow of information represented by
the ascending systems, which are a significant feature of the structure of the
brain, and although they do allow associational learning with multiple-trial,
they simply don't provide the capacity for one-time learning.
  In this research we model this effect using an artificial neural network
(ANN), creating a salience-affected neural network (SANN). We adapt an ANN to
embody the capacity to respond to an input salience signal and to produce a
reverse salience signal during testing.
  This research demonstrates that input combinations similar to the inputs in
the training data sets will produce similar reverse salience signals during
testing. Furthermore, this research has uncovered a novel method for training

tolerate a certain degree of overlap without being in conflict. This subclass
of perfect graphs has been extensively studied, due to both its interesting
structure and its numerous applications. Several efficient algorithms for
optimization problems that are NP-hard on general graphs have been designed for
tolerance graphs. In spite of this, the recognition of tolerance graphs -
namely, the problem of deciding whether a given graph is a tolerance graph - as
well as the recognition of their main subclass of bounded tolerance graphs,
have been the most fundamental open problems on this class of graphs (cf. the
book on tolerance graphs \cite{GolTol04}) since their introduction in 1982
\cite{GoMo82}. In this article we prove that both recognition problems are
NP-complete, even in the case where the input graph is a trapezoid graph. The
presented results are surprising because, on the one hand, most subclasses of
perfect graphs admit polynomial recognition algorithms and, on the other hand,
bounded tolerance graphs were believed to be efficiently recognizable as they
are a natural special case of trapezoid graphs (which can be recognized in
polynomial time) and share a very similar structure with them. For our
reduction we extend the notion of an \emph{acyclic orientation} of permutation
and trapezoid graphs. Our main tool is a new algorithm that uses \emph{vertex
splitting} to transform a given trapezoid graph into a permutation graph, while
preserving this new acyclic orientation property. This method of vertex
splitting is of independent interest; very recently, it has been proved a
powerful tool also in the design of efficient recognition algorithms for other
classes of graphs \cite{MC-Trapezoid}.

time-dependent. The dynamics is modelized by an infinite-dimensional Stochastic
Differential Equation with local time. Existence and uniqueness of a strong
solution is proven for such an equation with fixed deterministic initial
condition. We also find a class of reversible measures.

well-defined avalanches of electrical activity. Such avalanches have been
claimed to be generically scale-invariant -- i.e. power-law distributed -- with
many exciting implications in Neuroscience. Recently, a self-organized model
has been proposed by Levina, Herrmann and Geisel to justify such an empirical
finding. Given that (i) neural dynamics is dissipative and (ii) there is a
loading mechanism ""charging"" progressively the background synaptic strength,
this model/dynamics is very similar in spirit to forest-fire and earthquake
models, archetypical examples of non-conserving self-organization, which have
been recently shown to lack true criticality. Here we show that cortical neural
networks obeying (i) and (ii) are not generically critical; unless parameters
are fine tuned, their dynamics is either sub- or super-critical, even if the
pseudo-critical region is relatively broad. This conclusion seems to be in
agreement with the most recent experimental observations. The main implication
of our work is that, if future experimental research on cortical networks were
to support that truly critical avalanches are the norm and not the exception,
then one should look for more elaborate (adaptive/evolutionary) explanations,
beyond simple self-organization, to account for this.

analyze algebraic gossip (i.e., random linear coding) and consider three gossip

time of algebraic gossip is known to be linear for the complete graph, but the
question of determining a tight upper bound or lower bounds for general graphs
is still open. We take a major step in solving this question, and prove that
algebraic gossip on any graph of size n is O(D*n) where D is the maximum degree
of the graph. This leads to a tight bound of Theta(n) for bounded degree graphs
and an upper bound of O(n^2) for general graphs. We show that the latter bound
is tight by providing an example of a graph with a stopping time of Omega(n^2).
Our proofs use a novel method that relies on Jackson's queuing theorem to
analyze the stopping time of network coding; this technique is likely to become
useful for future research.

$M$ has been a controversial topic along last decades: on one hand, some
attempted definitions were not fully consistent, on the other, there were
simple examples where an open conformal embedding $i:M\hookarrow M_{0}$ could
be defined, but the corresponding conformal boundary $\partial_{i}M$ disagreed
drastically with the causal one. Nevertheless, the recent progress in this
topic suggests a definitive option for $\partial M$, which is developed here in
detail. Our study has two parts: (I) To give general arguments on a boundary in
order to ensure that it is admissible as a causal boundary at the three natural
levels, i.e., as a point set, as a chronological space and as a topological
space. Then, the essential uniqueness of our choice is stressed, and the
relatively few admissible alternatives are discussed. (II) To analyze the role
of the conformal boundary $\partial_{i}M$. We show that, in general,
$\partial_{i}M$ may present a very undesirable structure. Nevertheless, it is
well-behaved under certain general assumptions, and its accessible part
$\partial_{i}^{*}M$ agrees with the causal boundary. This study justifies both
boundaries. On one hand, the conformal boundary $\partial_{i}^{*}M$, which
cannot be defined for a general spacetime but is easily computed in particular
examples, appears now as a special case of the causal boundary. On the other,
the new redefinition of the causal boundary not only is free of inconsistencies
and applicable to any strongly causal spacetime, but also recovers the expected
structure in the cases where a natural conformal boundary is available. The
cases of globally hyperbolic spacetimes and asymptotically conformally flat
ends are especially studied.

convection-induced line asymmetry on the derived 6Li abundance for a range in
effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity covering the stars of the
Asplund et al. (2006) sample. When the asymmetry effect is taken into account
for this sample of stars, the resulting 6Li/7Li ratios are reduced by about
1.5% on average with respect to the isotopic ratios determined by Asplund et
al. (2006). This purely theoretical correction diminishes the number of
significant 6Li detections from 9 to 4 (2 sigma criterion), or from 5 to 2 (3
sigma criterion). In view of this result the existence of a 6Li plateau appears
questionable. A careful reanalysis of individual objects by fitting the
observed lithium 6707 A doublet both with 3D NLTE and 1D LTE synthetic line
profiles confirms that the inferred 6Li abundance is systematically lower when
using 3D NLTE instead of 1D LTE line fitting. Nevertheless, halo stars with
unquestionable 6Li detection do exist even if analyzed in 3D-NLTE, the most
prominent example being HD 84937.

exact support recovery which are especially applicable in the case of ill-posed

Additionally, the relations between different conditions for exact support

introducing an anomalous U(1)_X gauge symmetry. Around the string scale, the

while all the SM particles are even. S obtains a vacuum expectation value
around the TeV scale, and then it can three-body decay dominantly to the

dividing the shear rate by the square of the electric field and multiplying by
the square of a reference electric field value, for each temperature, where two
Newtonian plateaus appear at low and high shear rate values, connected by a
shear-thinning region at intermediate shear rate values. Theoretical
interpretation of the observed behaviours is proposed in the framework of the

by the intensity and the frequency of the transverse field. This scheme is
robust against stochastic fluctuations in the atomic beam, and it does not
require atomic detection nor velocity selection.

moment data obtained from simulations as well as experiments. Temporally
correlated optical wave-fronts were simulated such that they followed
Kolmogorov phase statistics. The wave-fronts reconstructed either by modal or
zonal methods can be represented in terms of Zernike moments. The servo lag
error in adaptive optics is minimized by predicting Zernike moments in the near
future by using the data from the immediate past. It is shown statistically
that the prediction accuracy depends on the number of past phase screens used
for prediction and servo lag time scales. The algorithm is optimized in terms
of these parameters for real time and efficient operation of the adaptive
optics system. On an average, we report more than 3% improvement in the
wave-front compensation after prediction. This analysis helps in optimizing the
design parameters for sensing and correction in closed loop adaptive optics
systems.

trace particle acceleration processes and gamma-ray observations allow the
nature and sites of acceleration to be studied. Aims: We characterise the
distribution and sources of cosmic rays in the LMC from analysis of gamma-ray
observations. Methods: We analyse 11 months of continuous sky-survey
observations obtained with the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-Ray
Space Telescope and compare it to tracers of the interstellar medium and models
of the gamma-ray sources in the LMC. Results: The LMC is detected at 33 sigma
significance. The integrated >100 MeV photon flux of the LMC amounts to (2.6
+/- 0.2) * 10^-7 ph/cm2/s which corresponds to an energy flux of (1.6 +/- 0.1)
* 10^-10 erg/cm2/s, with additional systematic uncertainties of ~16%. The
analysis reveals the massive star forming region 30 Doradus as a bright source
of gamma-ray emission in the LMC in addition to fainter emission regions found
in the northern part of the galaxy. The gamma-ray emission from the LMC shows
very little correlation with gas density and is rather correlated to tracers of
massive star forming regions. The close confinement of gamma-ray emission to
star forming regions suggests a relatively short GeV cosmic-ray proton
diffusion length. Conclusions: The close correlation between cosmic-ray density
and massive star tracers supports the idea that cosmic rays are accelerated in
massive star forming regions as a result of the large amounts of kinetic energy
that are input by the stellar winds and supernova explosions of massive stars
into the interstellar medium.

  Aims: We introduce our newly implemented three-dimensional frequency

  Methods: The module combines the advantage of the speed of an approximate
Flux Limited Diffusion (FLD) solver with the high accuracy of a frequency

  Results: We prove the viability of the scheme in a standard radiation
benchmark test compared to a full frequency dependent Monte-Carlo based
radiative transfer code. The setup includes a central star, a circumstellar
flared disk, as well as an envelope. The test is performed for different
optical depths. Considering the frequency dependence of the stellar
irradiation, the temperature distributions can be described precisely in the
optically thin, thick, and irradiated transition regions. Resulting radiative
forces onto dust grains are reproduced with high accuracy. The achievable
parallel speedup of the method imposes no restriction on further radiative
(magneto-) hydrodynamics simulations.
  Conclusions: The proposed approximate radiation transport method enables
frequency dependent radiation hydrodynamics studies of the evolution of

photons absorbed per atom from an ultrashort laser pulse is able to induce a
strong magnetization within a few hundred femtoseconds. Here we resolve this
mystery by directly computing the number of photons per atom layer by layer as
the light wave propagates inside the sample. We find that for all the 24
experiments considered here, each atom has more than one photon. The so-called
photon shortage does not exist. By plotting the relative demagnetization change
versus the number of photons absorbed per atom, we show that depending on the
experimental condition, 0.1 photon can induce about 4% to 72% spin moment
change. Our perturbation theory reveals that the demagnetization depends
linearly on the amplitude of laser field. In addition, we find that the
transition frequency of a sample may also play a role in magnetization
processes. As far as the intensity is not zero, the intensity of the laser
field only affects the matching range of the transition frequencies, but not
whether the demagnetization can happen or not.

covered by the HFI instrument. The LFI is an array of microwave radiometers

implemented in a differential system using blackbody loads as reference

addition, their atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity

estimated using a non-LTE grid of model atmospheres. Comparisons of the
projected rotational velocities have been made with the predictions of stellar
evolutionary models and in general good agreement was found. However for a
small number of targets, their observed rotational velocities were
significantly larger than predicted, although their nitrogen abundances were
consistent with the rest of the sample. We conclude that binarity may have
played a role in generating their large rotational velocities. No correlation
was found between nitrogen abundances and the current projected rotational
velocities. However a correlation was found with the inferred projected
rotational velocities of the main sequence precursors of our supergiant sample.
This correlation is again in agreement with the predictions of single star
evolutionary models that incorporate rotational mixing. The origin of the
macroturbulent and microturbulent velocity fields is discussed and our results
support previous theoretical studies that link the former to sub-photospheric
convection and the latter to non-radial gravity mode oscillations. In addition,
we have attempted to identify differential rotation in our most rapidly

that the quasiparticles condensing have relatively short lifetimes, and so as
for lasers, external pumping is required to maintain a steady state. On the

interacting, and therefore better able to thermalise. This leads to questions
of how to describe such non-equilibrium condensates, and their relation to
equilibrium condensates and lasers. This chapter discusses in detail how the
non-equilibrium Green's function approach can be applied to the description of
such a non-equilibrium condensate, in particular, a system of microcavity
polaritons, driven out of equilibrium by coupling to multiple baths. By
considering the steady states, and fluctuations about them, it is possible to
provide a description that relates both to equilibrium condensation and to

Wigner-Dyson type although the classical dynamics in both cases is the same.
The resolution turns out surprisingly simple. The Maslov indices of orbits
within multiplets of degenerate length either yield equal phases for the
respective Feynman amplitudes (and thus Poissonian level statistics) or give
rise to amplitudes with uncorrelated phases (leading to Wigner-Dyson level
correlations). The recent semiclassical explanation of spectral universality in
