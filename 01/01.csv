  Mathematical Society",,,,"math.AG math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  If $X$ is a smooth manifold then the $\mathbb R$-algebra $C^\infty(X)$ of
smooth functions $c:X\to\mathbb R$ is a $C^\infty$-$ring$. That is, for each
smooth function $f:{\mathbb R}^n\to\mathbb R$ there is an $n$-fold operation
$\Phi_f:C^\infty(X)^n\to C^\infty(X)$ acting by $\Phi_f:(c_1,\ldots,c_n)\mapsto
f(c_1,...,c_n)$, and these operations $\Phi_f$ satisfy many natural identities.
Thus, $C^\infty(X)$ actually has a far richer structure than the obvious
$\mathbb R$-algebra structure.
  We develop a version of algebraic geometry in which rings or algebras are
replaced by $C^\infty$-rings. As schemes are the basic objects in algebraic
geometry, the new basic objects are $C^\infty$-$schemes$, a category of
geometric objects which generalize smooth manifolds, and whose morphisms
generalize smooth maps. We also study quasicoherent and coherent sheaves on
$C^\infty$-schemes, and $C^\infty$-$stacks$, in particular Deligne-Mumford
$C^\infty$-stacks, a 2-category of geometric objects generalizing orbifolds.
  This enables us to use the tools of algebraic geometry in differential
geometry, and to describe singular spaces such as moduli spaces occurring in
differential geometric problems. This paper forms the foundations of the
author's new theory of ""derived differential geometry"", surveyed in
arXiv:1206.4207 and in more detail in arXiv:1208.4948, which studies
d-manifolds and d-orbifolds, ""derived"" versions of smooth manifolds and smooth
orbifolds. Derived differential geometry has applications to areas of
symplectic geometry involving moduli spaces of $J$-holomorphic curves.
  Many of these ideas are not new: $C^\infty$-rings and $C^\infty$-schemes have
long been part of synthetic differential geometry. But we develop them in new
directions. This paper is surveyed in arXiv:1104.4951.

which was recently announced to host a giant planet detected with astrometry.
The new observations were obtained using optical spectrographs(MIKE/Magellan
and ESPaDOnS/CHFT) and cover a 63% of the reported period of 270 days. We apply
Least-squares periodograms to identify the most significant signals and
evaluate their corresponding False Alarm Probabilities. We show that this
method is the proper generalization to astrometric data because (1) it
mitigates the coupling of the orbital parameters with the parallax and proper
motion, and (2) it permits a direct generalization to include non-linear
Keplerian parameters in a combined fit to astrometry and radial velocity data.
In fact, our analysis of the astrometry alone uncovers the reported 270 d
period and an even stronger signal at 50 days. We estimate the uncertainties in
the parameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. The nominal precision
of the new Doppler measurements is about 150 s$^{-1}$ while their standard
deviation is 250 ms$^{-1}$. However, the best fit solutions still have RMS of
200 ms$^{-1}$ indicating that the excess in variability is due to uncontrolled
systematic errors rather than the candidate companions detected in the
astrometry. Although the new data alone cannot rule-out the presence of a
candidate, when combined with published radial velocity measurements, the False
Alarm Probabilities of the best solutions grow to unacceptable levels strongly
suggesting that the observed astrometric wobble is not due to an unseen
companion.

description of mean blazar SEDs. The possible contribution of MeV blazars to
the EGRB in the MeV band is also discussed. In five total years of

the corresponding sensitivity limit. We also address the detectability of the
highest-redshift blazars. Updating our model with regard to high-redshift
evolution based on SDSS quasar data, we show that Fermi may find some blazars
up to z~6 during the five-year survey. Such blazars could provide a new probe
of early star and galaxy formation through GeV spectral attenuation signatures
induced by high-redshift UV background radiation.

differential or difference equations, a unified treatment of continuous,
semi-discrete (Ablowitz-Ladik) and fully discrete matrix NLS systems is
presented. These equations originate from a universal equation within this
framework, by specifying a representation of the bidifferential graded algebra
and imposing a reduction. By application of a general result, corresponding
families of exact solutions are obtained that in particular comprise the matrix
soliton solutions in the focusing NLS case. The solutions are parametrised in
terms of constant matrix data subject to a Sylvester equation (which previously
appeared as a rank condition in the integrable systems literature). These data
exhibit a certain redundancy, which we diminish to a large extent.
  More precisely, we first consider more general AKNS-type systems from which
two different matrix NLS systems emerge via reductions. In the continuous case,
the familiar Hermitian conjugation reduction leads to a continuous matrix
(including vector) NLS equation, but it is well-known that this does not work
as well in the discrete cases. On the other hand there is a complex conjugation
reduction, which apparently has not been studied previously. It leads to square
matrix NLS systems, but works in all three cases (continuous, semi- and
fully-discrete). A large part of this work is devoted to an exploration of the
corresponding solutions, in particular regularity and asymptotic behaviour of
matrix soliton solutions.

dwarf (WD) during mass accretion from a binary companion. When the deflagration
wave passes through the outer layer of the CO WD, p-nuclei are produced by
photodisintegration reactions on s-nuclei in a region with the peak temperature
ranging from 1.9 to 3.6 x10^9 K. We confirm the sensitivity of the p-process on
the initial distribution of s-nuclei. We show that the initial C/O ratio in the
WD does not much affect the yield of p-nuclei. On the other hand, the abundance
of 22Ne left after the s-processing has a large influence on the p-process via
22Ne(alpha,n) reaction. We find that about 50% of p-nuclides are co-produced
when normalized to their solar abundances in all adopted cases of seed
distribution. Mo and Ru, which are largely underproduced in Type II supernovae
(SNe II), are produced more than in SNe II although they are underproduced with
respect to the yield levels of other p-nuclides. The ratios between p-nuclei
and iron in the ejecta are larger than the solar ratios by a factor of 1.2. We
also compare the yields of oxygen, iron, and p-nuclides in SNe Ia and SNe II
and suggest that SNe Ia could make a larger contribution than SNe II to the
solar system content of p-nuclei.

long time ago. In this work we prove that the interior static region is
unstable under linear gravitational perturbations, by showing that field
perturbations compactly supported within this region will generically excite a
mode that grows exponentially in time. This result gives an alternative reason
to mass inflation to consider the space time extension beyond the Cauchy
horizon as physically irrelevant, and thus provides support to the strong
cosmic censorship conjecture, which is also backed by recent evidence of a
linear gravitational instability in the interior region of Kerr black holes
found by the authors. The use of intertwiners to solve for the evolution of
initial data plays a key role, and adapts without change to the case of
super-extremal \rn black holes, allowing to complete the proof of the linear
instability of this naked singularity. A particular intertwiner is found such

a result, even for the same spacetime, it may be singular in the HL theory but

condition are studied, one is the (anti-) de Sitter Schwarzschild solutions,
and the other is the Lu-Mei-Pope (LMP) solutions written in a form satisfying
the projectability condition - the generalized LMP solutions. The (anti-) de

analytical results is an essential advance that provides deeper understanding

numerical development. In this paper shape evolution equations for a vesicle in
a shear flow are derived analytically with precision being cubic (which is
quadratic in previous theories) with regard to the deformation of the vesicle

parameters where different types of motion (tank-treading, tumbling and

discrepancy between previous theories and recent experiments and numerical
studies, but also it reveals a new phenomenon: the VB mode band in parameter
space, which is believed to saturate after a moderate shear rate, exhibits a
striking widening beyond a critical shear rate. The widening results from

higher than state-of-the-art practical solutions for some configurations. For

shown to achieve a rate at least half of the optimal rate.

includes filamentary and loop-like structures that are magnetized, a diffuse
extent similar to the associated diffuse X-ray emission. But the radio and
X-ray structures in the central region differ strikingly, indicating that they
trace very different forms of particle injection from the pulsar and/or
particle acceleration in the nebula. No spectral index gradient is detected in
the radio emission across the PWN, whereas the X-ray emission softens outward
in the nebula. The extensive radio polarization allows us to image in detail
the intrinsic magnetic field, which is well-ordered and reveals that a number
of loop-like filaments are strongly magnetized. In addition, we determine that
there are both radial and toroidal components to the magnetic field structure
of the pulsar wind nebula. Strong mid-IR emission detected in Spitzer Space
Telescope data is closely correlated with the radio emission arising from the
southern edge of G54.1+0.3. In particular, the distributions of radio and X-ray
emission compared with the mid-IR emission suggest that the PWN may be
interacting with this interstellar cloud. This may be the first PWN where we
are directly detecting its interplay with an interstellar cloud that has
survived the impact of the supernova explosion associated with the pulsar's
progenitor.

selects the ""true"" model, the OLS post-Lasso estimator becomes the oracle
estimator. An important ingredient in our analysis is a new sparsity bound on
the dimension of the model selected by Lasso, which guarantees that this
dimension is at most of the same order as the dimension of the ""true"" model.
Our rate results are nonasymptotic and hold in both parametric and
nonparametric models. Moreover, our analysis is not limited to the Lasso
estimator acting as a selector in the first step, but also applies to any other
estimator, for example, various forms of thresholded Lasso, with good rates and
good sparsity properties. Our analysis covers both traditional thresholding and
a new practical, data-driven thresholding scheme that induces additional
sparsity subject to maintaining a certain goodness of fit. The latter scheme
has theoretical guarantees similar to those of Lasso or OLS post-Lasso, but it
dominates those procedures as well as traditional thresholding in a wide
variety of experiments.

between an amplitude dependence which depends on velocity and one which depends
on some other parameter like displacement. In contrast to the torsional

the sheaf of null geodesics of the Chern conformal structure. We then introduce
a Lagrangian and associated Hamiltonian from which the degenerate conformal

are given for a rank three degenerate conformal Lorentzian metric in four

where the goal is to give a single tile assembly system that simulates the
behavior of any other tile assembly system. We give a tile assembly system that

Specifically, we give a tile set that simulates the assembly of any tile
assembly system in a class of systems that we call \emph{locally consistent}:
each tile binds with exactly the strength needed to stay attached, and that
there are no glue mismatches between tiles in any produced assembly.
  Our construction is reminiscent of the studies of \emph{intrinsic
universality} of cellular automata by Ollinger and others, in the sense that
our simulation of a tile system $T$ by a tile system $U$ represents each tile
in an assembly produced by $T$ by a $c \times c$ block of tiles in $U$, where
$c$ is a constant depending on $T$ but not on the size of the assembly $T$
produces (which may in fact be infinite). Also, our construction improves on
earlier simulations of tile assembly systems by other tile assembly systems (in
particular, those of Soloveichik and Winfree, and of Demaine et al.) in that we
simulate the actual process of self-assembly, not just the end result, as in
Soloveichik and Winfree's construction, and we do not discriminate against
infinite structures. Both previous results simulate only temperature 1 systems,
whereas our construction simulates tile assembly systems operating at
temperature 2.

C_1, but her transmissions also reach an eavesdropper Eve through another
channel C_2. The goal is to design a coding scheme that makes it possible for
Alice to communicate both reliably and securely. Reliability is measured in
terms of Bob's probability of error in recovering the message, while security
is measured in terms of Eve's equivocation ratio. Wyner showed that the
situation is characterized by a single constant C_s, called the secrecy
capacity, which has the following meaning: for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exist
coding schemes of rate $R \ge C_s - \epsilon$ that asymptotically achieve both
the reliability and the security objectives. However, his proof of this result
is based upon a nonconstructive random-coding argument. To date, despite a
considerable research effort, the only case where we know how to construct
coding schemes that achieve secrecy capacity is when Eve's channel C_2 is an
erasure channel, or a combinatorial variation thereof.
  Polar codes were recently invented by Arikan; they approach the capacity of
symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels with low encoding and
decoding complexity. Herein, we use polar codes to construct a coding scheme
that achieves the secrecy capacity for a wide range of wiretap channels. Our
construction works for any instantiation of the wiretap channel model, as long
as both C_1 and C_2 are symmetric and binary-input, and C_2 is degraded with
respect to C_1. Moreover, we show how to modify our construction in order to
provide strong security, in the sense defined by Maurer, while still operating
at a rate that approaches the secrecy capacity. In this case, we cannot
guarantee that the reliability condition will be satisfied unless the main
channel C_1 is noiseless, although we believe it can be always satisfied in
practice.

energy of the FeXXVI Ly$\gamma$ line) in the spectrum of the Galactic center
observed by the Suzaku X-ray mission cannot be explained by standard ionization
and recombination processes. We suggest that the origin of this excess is via
decays of sterile neutrinos with a mass of 17.4 keV and estimate the value of
the mixing angle. The estimated value of the mixing angle $\sin^2(2\theta)=(4.1
\pm 2.2)\times10^{-12}$ lies in the allowed region of the mixing angle of dark
matter sterile neutrino with a mass of 17-18 keV.

parts per million (ppm) signal from an Earth-Sun equivalent transit. Such
precision requires superb instrument stability on time scales up to ~2 days and
systematic error removal to better than 20 ppm. To this end, the spacecraft and
photometer underwent 67 days of commissioning, which included several data sets
taken to characterize the photometer performance. Because Kepler has no
shutter, we took a series of dark images prior to the dust cover ejection, from
which we measured the bias levels, dark current, and read noise. These basic
detector properties are essentially unchanged from ground-based tests,
indicating that the photometer is working as expected. Several image artifacts
have proven more complex than when observed during ground testing, as a result
of their interactions with starlight and the greater thermal stability in
flight, which causes the temperature-dependent artifact variations to be on the
timescales of transits. Because of Kepler's unprecedented sensitivity and
stability, we have also seen several unexpected systematics that affect
photometric precision. We are using the first 43 days of science data to
characterize these effects and to develop detection and mitigation methods that
will be implemented in the calibration pipeline. Based on early testing, we
expect to attain Kepler's planned photometric precision over 80%-90% of the

equation, the master action often exhibits further global symmetries, which may
be in turn gauged. We show how to carry this out in a BV algebraic set up.
Depending on the nature of the global symmetry, the gauging involves coupling
to a pure ghost system with a varying amount of ghostly supersymmetry. Coupling
to an N=0 ghost system yields an ordinary gauge theory whose observables are
appropriately classified by the invariant BV cohomology. Coupling to an N=1
ghost system leads to a topological gauge field theory whose observables are
classified by the equivariant BV cohomology. Coupling to higher $N$ ghost
systems yields topological gauge field theories with higher topological
symmetry. In the latter case, however, problems of a completely new kind
emerge, which call for a revision of the standard BV algebraic framework.

photometry from the first 34 days of science operations of the Kepler Mission.
The light curves, obtained with 30-minute sampling, reveal clear oscillations
in a large sample of G and K giants, extending in luminosity from the red clump
down to the bottom of the giant branch. We confirm a strong correlation between
the large separation of the oscillations (Delta nu) and the frequency of
maximum power (nu_max). We focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars (nu_max
> 100 muHz, L <~ 30 L_sun) having high signal-to-noise ratios and showing the
unambiguous signature of solar-like oscillations. These are H-shell-burning
stars, whose oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellar
evolution and for constraining the star-formation rate in the local disk. We
use a new technique to compare stars on a single echelle diagram by scaling
their frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to radial and
non-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes with angular degree
l=3. Measuring the small separation between l=0 and l=2 allows us to plot the
so-called C-D diagram of delta nu_02 versus Delta nu. The small separation
delta nu_01 of l=1 from the midpoint of adjacent l=0 modes is negative,
contrary to the Sun and solar-type stars. The ridge for l=1 is notably
broadened, which we attribute to mixed modes, confirming theoretical
predictions for low-luminosity giants. Overall, the results demonstrate the
tremendous potential of Kepler data for asteroseismology of red giants.
