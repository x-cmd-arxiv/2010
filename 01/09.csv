Predictions
thus far have focused on subsets of landscape vacua that share most properties
with our own. Using the entropic principle (the assumption that entropy
production traces the formation of complex structures such as observers), we
derive six predictions that apply to the whole landscape. Typical observers
find themselves in a flat universe, at the onset of vacuum domination,
surrounded by a recently produced bath of relativistic quanta. These quanta are
neither very dilute nor condensed, and thus appear as a roughly thermal
background. Their characteristic wavelength is of order the inverse fourth root
of the vacuum energy. These predictions hold for completely arbitrary
observers, in arbitrary vacua with potentially exotic particle physics and
cosmology. They agree with observation: We live in a flat universe at the onset
of vacuum domination, whose dominant entropy production process (the glow of
galactic dust) has recently produced a radiation bath (the cosmic infrared
background). This radiation is marginally dilute, relativistic, and has a
wavelength of order 100 microns, as predicted.

dispersions can be determined to within a few percent accuracy using two-epoch

observable is the threshold fraction--the fraction of stars that show velocity
changes larger than a given threshold between measurements. The threshold
fraction is tightly correlated with the dispersion introduced by binaries,
independent of the underlying binary fraction and distribution of orbital
parameters. We outline a simple procedure to correct the velocity dispersion to
within a few percent accuracy by using the threshold fraction and provide
fitting functions for this method. We also develop a methodology for
constraining properties of binary populations from both single- and two-epoch
velocity measurements by including the binary velocity distribution in a

to networks consisting of two types of nodes with edges running only between

instance in affiliation networks and in sexual contact networks in which both
types of nodes show the scale-free characteristic for the degree distribution.
During the depreciation process, an edge between nodes with degrees k and q is
retained with probability proportional to (kq)^(-alpha), where alpha is
positive so that links between hubs are more prone to failure. The removal

Supergiants and/or Asymptotic Giant Branch stars has lead to a serious
underestimation of the dynamical masses of infrared-bright galaxies. The
dominance of a nuclear disk of young stars in the near-infrared bands, where
dust obscuration does not block their signatures, can severely bias the global

these galaxies are forming m < m* ellipticals. On the other hand, precisely
because of dust obscuration, I-band photometry and central velocity dispersions
obtained with the Calcium II triplet at 0.85 microns reflect the global
properties of the mergers and suggest that all types of merger remnants,
including infrared-bright ones, will form m > m* ellipticals. Moreover, merger
remnants, including LIRGs, are placed on the I-band Fundamental Plane for the
first time and appear to be virtually indistinguishable from elliptical
galaxies.

at different moments in time: this points to the versatility of a dominant
design which allows a firm to react to a variety of user needs. Scaling at the
level of the industry took off only after subsequently reengineered models were

trajectory can be considered as a stabilization in a (distributed) environment,

galaxies are very different, from old ones with ages of T>10 Gyrs (IC 1541) to
relatively young, with the ages of T<2-3 Gyr (IC 1548, NGC 85). In one case,
current star formation is known (UCM 0018+2216). In most of the galaxies, more
precisely in all of them more luminous than M(B) -18, two-tiered
(`antitruncated') stellar disks are detected, whose radial surface brightness
profiles can be fitted by two exponential segments with different scalelengths
-- shorter near the center and longer at the periphery. All dwarf S0 galaxies
with single-scalelength exponential disks are close companions to giant
galaxies. Except for this fact, no dependence of the properties of S0 galaxies
on distance from the center of the group is found. Morphological traces of
minor merger are found in the lenticular galaxy NGC 85. Basing on the last two
points, we conclude that the most probable mechanisms for the transformation of
spirals into lenticular galaxies in groups are gravitational ones, namely,
minor mergers and tidal interactions.

components other than thermal dust. A comparison to published dust, synchrotron
and free-free models implies an excess of emission in the 100 GHz QUaD band,
while better agreement is found at 150 GHz. A smaller excess is observed when
comparing QUaD 100 GHz data to WMAP 5-year W band; in this case the excess is
likely due to the wider bandwidth of QUaD. Combining the QUaD and WMAP data, a
two-component spectral fit to the inner galactic plane (|b|<1 degree) yields
mean spectral indices of -0.32 +/- 0.03 and 2.84 +/- 0.03; the former is
interpreted as a combination of the spectral indices of synchrotron, free-free

galaxy NGC 5548. The campaign consists of 7 observations. We analyze the
response in the opacity of the gas that forms the ionized absorber to ionizing
flux variations. Despite variations by a factor of 4 in the impinging
continuum, the soft X-ray spectra of the source show little spectral
variations, suggesting no response from the ionized absorber. A detailed time
modeling confirms the lack of opacity variations for an absorbing component
with high ionization. Instead, the models tentatively suggest that the
ionization parameter of a low ionization absorbing component might be changing
with the ionizing flux, as expected for gas in photoionization equilibrium.
Using the lack of variations, we set an upper limit of n_e <2.0E7 cm-3 for the
electron density of the gas forming the high ionization, high velocity
component. This implies a large distance from the continuum source (R > 0.033
pc). If the variations in the low ionization component are real, they imply n_e
>9.8E4 cm-3 and R < 3 pc. We discuss our results in terms of two different
scenarios: a large scale outflow originating in the inner parts of the
accretion disk, or a thermally driven wind originating much farther out. Given
the large distance of the wind, the implied mass outflow rate is also large (Mw
> 0.08 Maccr). The associated total kinetic energy deployed by the wind in the
host galaxy (>1.2E56 erg) can be enough to disrupt the interstellar medium,
possibly regulating large scale star formation. The total mass and energy
ejected by the wind is still lower than the one required for cosmic feedback,

Phenomenologically two TeV-scale Majorana fermions with a small mass split can
realize a resonant leptogenesis whereas a TeV-scale Higgs triplet with a small

the free-energy landscape of the model, identifying parameter ranges where fcc
is stable or metastable with respect to bcc. In addition, we derive analytical

show that a non-vanishing amplitude of [200] density waves is essential to
obtain mechanically stable fcc crystals with a non-vanishing tetragonal shear
modulus (C11 - C12)/2. We determine the model parameters for specific materials

to the surface of an AGN-blown bubble. If this is the case, charged particles
from the fully ionised intra-cluster medium (ICM) will be prevented,
ordinarily, from crossing the boundary by the Lorentz force. However, recent
observations indicate that thermal material may occupy up to 50% of the volume
of some bubbles. Given the effect of the Lorentz force, the thermal content
must then be attributed to one, or a combination, of the following processes:
i) the entrainment of thermal gas into the AGN outflow that inflated the
bubble; ii) rapid diffusion across the magnetic field lines at the ICM/bubble
interface; iii) magnetic reconnection events which transfer thermal material
across the ICM/bubble boundary. Unless the AGN outflow behaves as a magnetic
tower jet, entrainment may be significant and could explain the observed
thermal content of bubbles. Alternatively, the cross-field diffusion
coefficient required for the ICM to fill a typical bubble is roughly 10^16 cm^2
s^-1, which is anomalously high compared to predictions from turbulent
diffusion models. Finally, the mass transfer rate due to magnetic reconnection
is uncertain, but significant for plausible reconnection rates. We conclude
that entrainment into the outflow and mass transfer due to magnetic
reconnection events are probably the most significant sources of thermal
content in AGN-blown bubbles.

near a strongly coupled conformal fixed point, with conformal symmetry softly
broken by technifermion mass terms. Conformal symmetry breaking triggers chiral
symmetry breaking in the pattern SU(4) -> Sp(4), which gives rise to a
pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson that can act as a composite Higgs boson. The top
quark is elementary, and the top and electroweak gauge loop contributions to
the Higgs mass are cut off entirely by Higgs compositeness. In particular, the
model requires no top partners and no ""little Higgs"" mechanism. A nontrivial
vacuum alignment results from the interplay of the top loop and technifermion
mass terms. The composite Higgs mass is completely determined by the top loop,
in the sense that m_h/m_t is independent of the vacuum alignment and is
computable by a strong-coupling calculation. There is an additional composite
pseudoscalar A with mass larger than m_h and suppressed direct production at
LHC. We discuss the electroweak fit in this model in detail. Corrections to Z
-> bb and the T parameter from the top sector are suppressed by the enhanced
Sp(4) custodial symmetry. Even assuming that the strong contribution to the S
parameter is positive and usuppressed, a good electroweak fit can be obtained
for v/f ~ 0.25, where v and f are the electroweak and chiral symmetry breaking
scales respectively. This requires fine tuning at the 10% level.

electromagnetic cascades of lower energy photons and electrons. The collective
intensity of a cosmological population emitting at VHEs will be attenuated at
the highest energies through interactions with the EBL and enhanced at lower
energies by the resulting cascade. We calculate the cascade radiation created
by VHE photons produced by blazars and investigate the effects of cascades on
the collective intensity of blazars and the resulting effects on the
extragalactic gamma-ray background. We find that cascade radiation greatly
enhances the collective intensity from blazars at high energies before turning
over due to attenuation. The prominence of the resulting features depends on
the blazar gamma-ray luminosity function, spectral index distribution, and the
model of the EBL. We additionally calculate the cascade radiation from the
distinct spectral sub-populations of blazars, BL Lacertae (BL Lacs) objects and
flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), finding that the collective intensity of
BL Lacs is considerably more enhanced by cascade radiation than that of the

proton-proton collider with a nominal centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, is to
search for New Physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). A widely favoured BSM
candidate is Supersymmetry (SUSY), which postulates a superpartner for each
Standard Model particle. The first part of this thesis describes a strategy for
an early discovery of SUSY using the trilepton signature, with a focus on
gravity-mediated SUSY breaking, mSUGRA. The discovery potential for SUSY for
the case where strongly interacting supersymmetric particles are very massive
is critically investigated. A possible choice of triggers for L = 10-31cm-2s-1
is suggested by optimising the event yield at intermediate and final selection
stages. A novel method to measure the rate of leptons from heavy flavour decays
passing isolation requirements by isolating tt events in data is outlined.
  The task of the ATLAS silicon tracker is to track particles produced in
proton-proton collisions in its centre, measuring their momenta and production
vertices. The precise knowledge of the silicon tracker module positions and
their orientation in space (alignment) down to some microns and fractions of a
miliradian in the critical coordinates is of vital importance for large parts
of the ambitious ATLAS physics program. In the second part of the thesis, the
alignment of the ATLAS silicon tracker using the Robust Alignment algorithm and
particle tracks is described. The algorithm is applied to align end-cap A of
the pixel detector using cosmic ray particle tracks recorded during its
on-surface commissioning in 2006. Finally, about 2M cosmic ray tracks collected
by ATLAS in situ in autumn 2008 are utilised to provide a coherent alignment of
the entire silicon tracker with the Robust Alignment algorithm.

detail. Two a posteriori error indicators are derived, based on local residuals

of BPX norm equivalence for the refinement procedures under consideration.
While the available optimality results for the BPX norm have been constructed
primarily in the setting of uniformly refined meshes, a notable exception is
the local 2D red-green result due to Dahmen and Kunoth. The purpose of this
article is to extend this original 2D optimality result to the local 3D
red-green refinement procedure introduced by Bornemann-Erdmann-Kornhuber (BEK),
and then to use this result to extend the WHB optimality results from the
quasiuniform setting to local 2D and 3D red-green refinement scenarios. The BPX
extension is reduced to establishing that locally enriched finite element
subspaces allow for the construction of a scaled basis which is formally Riesz
stable. It is possible to show that the number of degrees of freedom used for
smoothing is bounded by a constant times the number of degrees of freedom
introduced at that level of refinement, indicating that a practical
implementable version of the resulting BPX preconditioner for the BEK
refinement setting has provably optimal (linear) computational complexity per
iteration. An interesting implication of the optimality of the WHB

whose vertices may perform nontrivial encoding and decoding operations on data
as it passes through the network. The main approach to deciding the feasibility
of network coding problems aims to reduce the problem to optimization over a
polytope of entropic vectors subject to constraints imposed by the network
structure. In the case of directed acyclic graphs, these constraints are
completely understood, but for general graphs the problem of enumerating them
remains open: it is not known how to classify the constraints implied by a
property that we call serializability, which refers to the absence of
paradoxical circular dependencies in a network code.
  In this work we initiate the first systematic study of the constraints
imposed on a network code by serializability. We find that serializability
cannot be detected solely by evaluating the Shannon entropy of edge sets in the
graph, but nevertheless, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that decides the
serializability of a network code. We define a certificate of
non-serializability, called an information vortex, that plays a role in the
theory of serializability comparable to the role of fractional cuts in
multicommodity flow theory, including a type of min-max relation. Finally, we
study the serializability deficit of a network code, defined as the minimum
number of extra bits that must be sent in order to make it serializable. For
linear codes, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate this parameter within a
constant factor, and we demonstrate some surprising facts about the behavior of
this parameter under parallel composition of codes.

approximation algorithms for abstract nonlinear operator equations on Banach

finite element methods (AFEM) applied to several classes of nonlinear elliptic
equations. In the first part of the paper, we develop a weak-* convergence
framework for nonlinear operators, whose Gateaux derivatives are locally
Lipschitz and satisfy a local inf-sup condition. The framework can be viewed as
extending the recent convergence results for linear problems of Morin, Siebert
and Veeser to a general nonlinear setting. We formulate an abstract adaptive
approximation algorithm for nonlinear operator equations in Banach spaces with
local structure. The weak-* convergence framework is then applied to this class
of abstract locally adaptive algorithms, giving a general convergence result.
The convergence result is then applied to a standard AFEM algorithm in the case
of several semilinear and quasi-linear scalar elliptic equations and elliptic
systems, including: a semilinear problem with subcritical nonlinearity, the
steady Navier-Stokes equations, and a quasilinear problem with nonlinear
diffusion. This yields several new AFEM convergence results for these nonlinear
problems. In the second part of the paper we develop a second abstract
convergence framework based on strong contraction, extending the recent
contraction results for linear problems of Cascon, Kreuzer, Nochetto, and
Siebert and of Mekchay and Nochetto to abstract nonlinear problems. The
contraction result is then applied to a standard AFEM algorithm for semilinear
problems with sub- and super-critical nonlinearities and for the Hamiltonian

states enjoying geometrical uniform symmetry with respect to a reference

is given by the positive operator-valued measure (POVM) obtained as a solution
of a convex optimization problem, namely a set of operators satisfying
geometrical symmetry, with respect to a reference operator $\Pi_0$, and
maximizing $\textrm{Tr}(\rho_0 \Pi_0)$. In this paper, by resolving the dual
problem, we show that the same result is obtained by minimizing the trace of a
semidefinite positive operator $X$ commuting with the symmetry operator and
such that $X >= \rho_0$. The new formulation gives a deeper insight into the
optimization problem and allows to obtain closed-form analytical solutions, as
shown by a simple but not trivial explanatory example. Besides the theoretical
interest, the result leads to semidefinite programming solutions of reduced
complexity, allowing to extend the numerical performance evaluation to quantum

scheme, cooperating nodes retransmit a weighted version of the source signal in
a decode-and-forward (DF) fashion. In the second scheme, while the source is
transmitting, cooperating nodes transmit weighted noise to confound the
eavesdropper (cooperative jamming (CJ)). We investigate two objectives, i.e.,
maximization of achievable secrecy rate subject to a total power constraint,
and minimization of total power transmit power under a secrecy rate constraint.
For the first design objective with a single eavesdropper we obtain expressions
for optimal weights under the DF protocol in closed form, and give an algorithm
that converges to the optimal solution for the CJ scheme; while for multiple
eavesdroppers we give an algorithm for the solution using the DF protocol that
is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution for two eavesdroppers. For
the second design objective, existing works introduced additional constraints
in order to reduce the degree of difficulty, thus resulting in suboptimal
solutions. In this work, either a closed form solution is obtained, or
algorithms to search for the solution are proposed. Numerical results are
presented to illustrate the proposed schemes and demonstrate the advantages of
cooperation as compared to direct transmission.

and analytic thought, the last of which is modeled as the formation of states
and of lattices of properties and contexts for concepts. The transition to the
modern mind of Homo sapiens is proposed to have resulted from onset of the
capacity to spontaneously and temporarily shift to an associative mode of
thought conducive to interaction amongst seemingly disparate concepts, modeled
as the forging of conjunctions resulting in states of entanglement. The fruits
of associative thought became ingredients for analytic thought, and vice versa.

molecular clouds is investigated using three-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations from the prestellar core until the end of the main accretion phase.
In collapsing clouds, the first (adiabatic) core with a size of ~10AU forms
prior to the formation of the protostar. At its formation, the first core has a
thick disk-like structure, and is mainly supported by the thermal pressure.
After the protostar formation, it decreases the thickness gradually, and
becomes supported by the centrifugal force. We found that the first core is a
precursor of the circumstellar disk. This indicates that the circumstellar disk
is formed before the protostar formation with a size of ~10AU, which means that
no protoplanetary disk smaller than <10AU exists. Reflecting the thermodynamics
of the collapsing gas, at the protostar formation epoch, the circumstellar disk
has a mass of ~0.01-0.1 solar mass, while the protostar has a mass of ~10^-3
solar mass. Thus, just after the protostar formation, the circumstellar disk is
about 10-100 times more massive than the protostar. Even in the main accretion
phase that lasts for ~10^5yr, the circumstellar disk mass dominates the
protostellar mass. Such a massive disk is unstable to gravitational
instability, and tends to show fragmentation. Our calculations indicate that
the planet or brown-dwarf mass object may form in the circumstellar disk in the
main accretion phase. In addition, the mass accretion rate onto the protostar
shows strong time variability that is caused by the perturbation of
proto-planets and/or the spiral arms in the circumstellar disk. Such
variability provides a useful signature for detecting the planet-sized
companion in the circumstellar disk around very young protostars.

(ii) metallic. The half-metallic solution is a ground state of the system and
the metallic one is a metastable state. The strong hybridization between Co
3$d$ and O 2$p$ orbitals decides the electronic and magnetic properties of the
compound. The total magnetic moment per formula unit is found to be $\sim$ 3
$\mu_B$ ($S$ = 3/2). Our calculations give the magnetocrystalline anisotropy
energy of $\sim$ 2.7 meV, which provides a good description of experimentally
observed large magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The Heisenberg exchange
parameters up to fourth nearest neighbours are also calculated. The mean-field
theory gives the $T_C$ = 887 K. The possible physical implications of the
ferromagnetic half-metallic ground state are also discussed.

the galaxies are identified with extended FIRST radio sources. For passive
early-type galaxies, which we distinguish from the others by using the colour,
concentration and their principal components, we find a strong statistical
alignment of the radio axes with the optical minor axes. Since the radio
emission is driven by accretion on to a nuclear black hole we argue that the
observed correlation gives new insight into the structure of elliptical
galaxies, for example, whether or not the nuclear kinematics are decoupled from
the rest of the galaxy. Our results imply that a significant fraction of the
galaxies are oblate spheroids, perhaps rotationally supported, with their radio
emission aligned with the stellar minor axis. Remarkably, the strength of the
correlation of the radio major axis with the optical minor axis depends on
radio loudness. Those objects with a low ratio of FIRST radio flux density to
total stellar light show a strong minor axis correlation while the stronger
radio sources do not. This split may reflect different formation histories and
we suggest this may be a new manifestation of the better known dichotomy

primordial abundances of 6Li and 7Li and the predictions of big bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN) can be resolved by the existence of a negatively-charged
massive unstable supersymmetric particle (X-) during the BBN epoch. Here, we
present new BBN calculations with an X- particle utilizing an improved nuclear
reaction network including captures of nuclei by the particle, nuclear
reactions and beta-decays of normal nuclei and nuclei bound to the X- particles
(X-nuclei), and new reaction rates derived from recent rigorous quantum
many-body dynamical calculations. We find that this is still a viable model to
explain the observed 6Li and 7Li abundances. However, contrary to previous
results, neutral X-nuclei cannot significantly affect the BBN light-element
abundances. We also show that with the new rates the production of heavier
nuclei is suppressed and there is no signature on abundances of nuclei heavier
than Be in the X--particle catalyzed BBN model as has been previously proposed.
We also consider the version of this model whereby the X- particle decays into
the present cold dark matter. We analyze the this paradigm in light of the
recent constraints on the dark-matter mass deduced from the possible detected
events in the CDMS-II experiment. We conclude that based upon the inferred
range for the dark-matter mass, only X- decay via the weak interaction can
achieve the desired 7Li destruction while also reproducing the observed 6Li
abundance.

used by search engines, the auction for a keyword involves a certain number of

This auction is typically conducted for a number of rounds (say T). There are
click probabilities mu_ij associated with each agent-slot pairs. The goal of
the search engine is to maximize social welfare of the advertisers, that is,
the sum of values of the advertisers. The search engine does not know the true
values advertisers have for a click to their respective ads and also does not
know the click probabilities mu_ij s. A key problem for the search engine
therefore is to learn these click probabilities during the T rounds of the

for addressing such learning and incentives issues have recently been
introduced and are aptly referred to as multi-armed-bandit (MAB) mechanisms.
When m = 1, characterizations for truthful MAB mechanisms are available in the

interpret certain, distinct states by means of a simple picture. In this

as doorways into background states which are modeled statistically. The crucial
quantities are the overlaps between the eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian and
the doorway states, that is, the coupling coefficients occuring in the
expansion of true eigenstates in the simple model basis. Recently, the
distribution of the maximum coupling coefficients was introduced as a new,
highly sensitive statistical observable. In the particularly important regime
of weak interactions, this distribution is very well approximated by the
fidelity distribution, defined as the distribution of the overlap between the
doorway states with interaction and without interaction. Using a random matrix
model, we calculate the latter distribution exactly for regular and chaotic
background states in the cases of preserved and fully broken time--reversal

previous studies. The extinction curve of the disk galaxies is given in the

constant with inclination, suggesting a different kind of dust configuration

talk I will draw the status of art of this site assessment putting our studies
in the context of the wide international site testing activity that has been
done in Antarctica. I will focus on the site assessment relevant for
astronomical applications to be done in the visible up to the near infrared
ranges, i.e. those ranges for which the optical turbulence represents a
perturbing element for the quality of the images and the AO techniques an
efficient tool to correct these wavefront perturbations.
