range (~Mpc) force of gravitational strength in the cosmos while satisfying
local tests of gravity. The mechanism hinges on local symmetry restoration in
the presence of matter. In regions of sufficiently high matter density, the
field is drawn towards \phi = 0 where its coupling to matter vanishes and the
\phi-> -\phi symmetry is restored. In regions of low density, however, the
symmetry is spontaneously broken, and the field couples to matter with
gravitational strength. We predict deviations from general relativity in the
solar system that are within reach of next-generation experiments, as well as
astrophysically observable violations of the equivalence principle. The model
can be distinguished experimentally from Brans-Dicke gravity, chameleon
theories and brane-world modifications of gravity.

In the context of a flat LambdaCDM model, this improvement allows us to place
tighter constraints on the matter density from WMAP data alone, and on the
epoch of matter-radiation equality, The temperature-polarization (TE) spectrum
is detected in the 7-year data with a significance of 20 sigma, compared to 13
sigma with the 5-year data. The low-l EE spectrum, a measure of the optical
depth due to reionization, is detected at 5.5 sigma significance when averaged
over l = 2-7. The BB spectrum, an important probe of gravitational waves from
inflation, remains consistent with zero. The upper limit on tensor modes from
polarization data alone is a factor of 2 lower with the 7-year data than it was
using the 5-year data (Komatsu et al. 2010). We test the parameter recovery
process for bias and find that the scalar spectral index, ns, is biased high,
but only by 0.09 sigma, while the remaining parameters are biased by < 0.15
sigma. The improvement in the third peak measurement leads to tighter lower
limits from WMAP on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (e.g.,
neutrinos) in the early universe: Neff > 2.7 (95% CL). Also, using WMAP data
alone, the primordial helium mass fraction is found to be YHe = 0.28+0.14-0.15,
and with data from higher-resolution CMB experiments included, we now establish
the existence of pre-stellar helium at > 3 sigma (Komatsu et al. 2010).

This situation
has relevance in applications such as multi-cell coordination in cellular

We address the design of precoding (i.e. beamforming) vectors at each sender
with the aim of striking a compromise between beamforming gain at the intended
receiver (Egoism) and the mitigation of interference created towards other
receivers (Altruism). Combining egoistic and altruistic beamforming has been
shown previously to be instrumental to optimizing the rates in a MISO
interference channel (i.e. where receivers have no interference canceling
capability) . Here we explore these game-theoretic concepts in the more general
context of MIMO channels and using the framework of Bayesian games, allowing us
to derive (semi-)distributed precoding techniques. We draw parallels with
existing work on the MIMO interference channel, including rate-optimizing and
interference-alignement precoding techniques, showing how such techniques may
be improved and re-interpretated through a common prism based on balancing
egoistic and altruistic beamforming.

which are within 1-sigma of the previously published WMAP five-year values,
with slightly tighter constraints on variability with orbital phase, and limits
(but no detections) on linear polarization. Scaling factors are provided which,
when multiplied by the Wright Mars thermal model predictions at 350 micron,
reproduce WMAP seasonally averaged observations of Mars within ~2%. An
empirical model is described which fits brightness variations of Saturn due to
geometrical effects and can be used to predict the WMAP observations to within
3%. Seven-year mean temperatures for Uranus and Neptune are also tabulated.
Uncertainties in Uranus temperatures are 3%-4% in the 41, 61 and 94 GHz bands;
the smallest uncertainty for Neptune is ~8% for the 94 GHz band. Intriguingly,
the spectrum of Uranus appears to show a dip at ~30 GHz of unidentified origin,
although the feature is not of high statistical significance. Flux densities
for the five selected fixed celestial sources are derived from the seven-year
WMAP sky maps, and are tabulated for Stokes I, Q and U, along with polarization
fraction and position angle. Fractional uncertainties for the Stokes I fluxes
are typically 1% to 3%. Source variability over the seven-year baseline is also
estimated. Significant secular decrease is seen for Cas A and Tau A: our
results are consistent with a frequency independent decrease of about 0.53% per

string fragmentation or parton coalescence, is used in our study. When the
hadrons are formed from string fragmentation, the subsequent hadronic
rescatterings will result in particle mass dependence of nuclear modification
factor R_{CP}, which is consistent with the present experimental data. On the
other hand, in the framework of parton coalescence, the mass dependence
disappears and the strangeness plays an important role. Both mechanisms failed
to reproduce the p_{T} dependence of R_{CP} of pion, indicating that

onboard the Planck mission will acquire data at a rate much higher than the
data rate allowed by its telemetry bandwith of 35.5 kbps. The data are
processed by an onboard pipeline, followed onground by a reversing step. This
paper illustrates the LFI scientific onboard processing to fit the allowed
datarate. This is a lossy process tuned by using a set of 5 parameters Naver,
r1, r2, q, O for each of the 44 LFI detectors. The paper quantifies the level
of distortion introduced by the onboard processing, EpsilonQ, as a function of
these parameters. It describes the method of optimizing the onboard processing
chain. The tuning procedure is based on a optimization algorithm applied to
unprocessed and uncompressed raw data provided either by simulations, prelaunch
tests or data taken from LFI operating in diagnostic mode. All the needed
optimization steps are performed by an automated tool, OCA2, which ends with
optimized parameters and produces a set of statistical indicators, among them
the compression rate Cr and EpsilonQ. For Planck/LFI the requirements are Cr =
2.4 and EpsilonQ <= 10% of the rms of the instrumental white noise. To speedup
the process an analytical model is developed that is able to extract most of
the relevant information on EpsilonQ and Cr as a function of the signal
statistics and the processing parameters. This model will be of interest for
the instrument data analysis. The method was applied during ground tests when
the instrument was operating in conditions representative of flight. Optimized
parameters were obtained and the performance has been verified, the required
data rate of 35.5 Kbps has been achieved while keeping EpsilonQ at a level of
3.8% of white noise rms well within the requirements.

observations, we derive robust estimates for the uncertainties on the
normalization of an inverse-Compton component in the presence of the variations
in background thermal temperature actually seen in our target objects. Using
these, together with the pressures external to the lobes, we are able to place
interesting upper limits on the fraction of the energy density in the lobes of
Hydra A and Her A that can be provided by a population of relativistic
electrons with standard properties, assuming that the magnetic field is not
dominant; these limits are consistent with the long-standing idea that the
energy density in these lobes is dominated by a non-radiating particle
population. In Cygnus A, we find evidence in the spectra for an additional hard
component over and above the expected thermal emission, which is plausibly a
detection of inverse-Compton emission; even in this case, though, some
additional non-radiating particles and/or a departure from our standard
assumptions on the electron spectrum are necessary to allow pressure balance at
the mid-point of the lobes. As this is not the case in other Fanaroff-Riley
class II radio galaxies, we suggest that the rich environment of Cygnus A may
have some effect on its lobe particle content.

their linear polarization characteristics.
  The FEM design is that of a differential pseudo-correlation radiometer in
which the signal from the sky is compared with a 4-K blackbody load. The Low
Noise Amplifier (LNA) at the heart of the FEM is based on indium phosphide High
Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs). The radiometer incorporates a novel
phase-switch design which gives excellent amplitude and phase match across the
band.
  The noise temperature requirements are met within the measurement errors at
the two frequencies. For the most sensitive LNAs, the noise temperature at the
band centre is 3 and 5 times the quantum limit at 30 and 44 GHz respectively.
For some of the FEMs, the noise temperature is still falling as the ambient
temperature is reduced to 20 K. Stability tests of the FEMs, including a
measurement of the 1/f knee frequency, also meet mission requirements.
  The 30 and 44 GHz FEMs have met or bettered the mission requirements in all
critical aspects. The most sensitive LNAs have reached new limits of noise
temperature for HEMTs at their band centres. The FEMs have well-defined linear
polarization characteristcs.

years of data from WMAP are presented. The new results are consistent with
previous results, but have improved due to reduced noise from the additional
integration time, improved knowledge of the instrument performance, and
improved data analysis procedures. The improvements are described in detail.
The seven year data set is well fit by a minimal six-parameter flat Lambda-CDM
model. The parameters for this model, using the WMAP data in conjunction with
baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and priors
on H_0 from Hubble Space Telescope observations, are: Omega_bh^2 = 0.02260
+-0.00053, Omega_ch^2 = 0.1123 +-0.0035, Omega_Lambda = 0.728 +0.015 -0.016,
n_s = 0.963 +-0.012, tau = 0.087 +-0.014 and sigma_8 = 0.809 +-0.024 (68 % CL
uncertainties). The temperature power spectrum signal-to-noise ratio per
multipole is greater that unity for multipoles < 919, allowing a robust
measurement of the third acoustic peak. This measurement results in improved
constraints on the matter density, Omega_mh^2 = 0.1334 +0.0056 -0.0055, and the
epoch of matter- radiation equality, z_eq = 3196 +134 -133, using WMAP data
alone. The new WMAP data, when combined with smaller angular scale microwave
background anisotropy data, results in a 3 sigma detection of the abundance of
primordial Helium, Y_He = 0.326 +-0.075.The power-law index of the primordial
power spectrum is now determined to be n_s = 0.963 +-0.012, excluding the
Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by >3 sigma. These new WMAP measurements
provide important tests of Big Bang cosmology.

region, we aim to obtain a deterministic placement of sensors which, apart from
ensuring that the entire region comes under the purview of at least a single
sensor, minimises the number of sensors utilised. We begin by considering
regions devoid of obstacles and thus having every location amenable for
placement. Herein, we formalise the popular notion that sensors at the centres
of the hexagons of a hexagonal tessellation provide the most optimal placement.
We then move on to regions which may comprise obstacles of arbitrary size at
arbitrary locations. We recognise two distinct classes of obstacles, namely
transparent and opaque obstacles, which are distinguished by their ability (or
the lack of it) to permit sensing radiation through them. In the real world,
transparent obstacles model lakes, ponds and swamps, while the opaque ones
stand for, inter alia, hills, trees and walls.We propose a polynomial-time
algorithm for achieving optimal placement in the aforesaid scenarios and we

detected in the lower resolution NANTEN survey are mapped with a beam FWHM of

each complex into 4-7 small clouds of masses in the range of Mvir~10^3-4 Msol

  The northern SMC CO clouds follow similar empirical relationships to the
southern SMC population, yet they appear relatively under-luminous for their
size, suggesting that the star-forming environment in the SMC is not
homogeneous. Our data also suggests that the CO cloud population has little or
no extended CO envelope on scales<30 pc, further evidence that the weak CO
component in the north SMC is being disassociated by penetrating UV radiation.
  The new high-resolution data provide evidence for a variable correlation of
the CO integrated brightness with integrated HI and um emission; in particular
CO is often, but not always, found coincident with peaks of um emission,
verifying the need for matching-resolution um and HI data for a complete
assessment of the SMC H2 mass.

WMAP data, both when the data are analyzed alone and in combination with other
cosmological data. Even so, it is appropriate to search for any hints of
deviations from the now standard model of cosmology, which includes inflation,
dark energy, dark matter, baryons, and neutrinos. The cosmological community
has subjected the WMAP data to extensive and varied analyses. While there is
widespread agreement as to the overall success of the six-parameter LCDM model,
various ""anomalies"" have been reported relative to that model. In this paper we
examine potential anomalies and present analyses and assessments of their
significance. In most cases we find that claimed anomalies depend on posterior
selection of some aspect or subset of the data. Compared with sky simulations
based on the best fit model, one can select for low probability features of the
WMAP data. Low probability features are expected, but it is not usually
straightforward to determine whether any particular low probability feature is
the result of the a posteriori selection or of non-standard cosmology. We
examine in detail the properties of the power spectrum with respect to the LCDM
model. We examine several potential or previously claimed anomalies in the sky
maps and power spectra, including cold spots, low quadrupole power,
quadropole-octupole alignment, hemispherical or dipole power asymmetry, and
quadrupole power asymmetry. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence
for deviations from the LCDM model, which is generally an acceptable
statistical fit to WMAP and other cosmological data.

two-nanoparticle systems, T2 is strongly dependent on the orientation of the
two nanoparticles relative to the external magnetic field, which implies that
it may be possible to sense the orientation of a two-nanoparticle aggregate. To
optimize the sensitivity of SPIO nanoparticle sensors, we propose that it is
best to have aggregates with few nanoparticles, close together, measured with

sky is continuously compared with a stable reference signal, provided by a
cryogenic reference load system. The reference unit is composed by small
pyramidal horns, one for each radiometer, 22 in total, facing small absorbing
targets, made of a commercial resin ECCOSORB CR (TM), cooled to approximately
4.5 K. Horns and targets are separated by a small gap to allow thermal
decoupling. Target and horn design is optimized for each of the LFI bands,
centered at 70, 44 and 30 GHz. Pyramidal horns are either machined inside the
radiometer 20K module or connected via external electro-formed bended
waveguides. The requirement of high stability of the reference signal imposed a
careful design for the radiometric and thermal properties of the loads.
Materials used for the manufacturing have been characterized for thermal, RF

problem is the lack of information about galaxy distribution in the so-called
Zone of Avoidance (ZoA). The existence of the Local Void (LV) has a systematic
effect on these measurements. If the ZoA is randomly filled with mock galaxies,
then the calculated acceleration of the Local Group of galaxies (LG) has a
spurious component, resulting from the lack of real galaxies in the
intersection of the LV with the ZoA. This component affects both the
misalignment angle between the clustering dipole and the CMB dipole, and the
inferred value of mean matter density Omega_m. We calculate the amplitude of
the spurious acceleration acting on the LG due to the LV. Its value depends on
the geometry and size of the LV, as well as on its density contrast. However,
under the simplest assumption of the LV being spherical and completely empty,
within the linear theory this amplitude amounts only to about 45 km/s in units
of velocity. The resulting change in the misalignment angle is smaller than 1
degree, and the fractional change in the deduced value of Omega_m is about 5%.
Accounting for observationally indicated elongation of the LV and maintaining
the maximising assumption of a complete lack of galaxies inside increases these
numbers only moderately. Specifically, the amplitude of the spurious
acceleration rises to about 60 km/s, the misalignment angle remains still
smaller than 1 degree, and the fractional change in the deduced value of
Omega_m is enhanced to about 7%. Thus, despite the overall importance of the
Local Void for the motion of the Local Group, the influence of the intersection
of the LV with the ZoA on measurements of the clustering dipole is found to be
only a minor systematic effect.

post-process the simulation output to calculate the grain sputtering for a
variety of species and size distributions. We explore the parameter space
appropriate for this problem by altering the over-density of the ejecta clumps
and the speed of the reverse shocks. Since radiative cooling could lower the
temperature of the medium in which the dust is embedded and potentially protect
the dust by slowing or halting grain sputtering, we study the effects of
different cooling methods over the time scale of the simulations. In general,
our results indicate that grains with radii less than 0.1 microns are sputtered
to much smaller radii and often destroyed completely, while larger grains
survive their interaction with the reverse shock. We also find that, for high
ejecta densities, the percentage of dust that survives is strongly dependent on
the relative velocity between the clump and the reverse shock, causing up to
50% more destruction for the highest velocity shocks. The fraction of dust
destroyed varies widely across grain species, ranging from total destruction of
Al2O3 grains to minimal destruction of Fe grains (only 20% destruction in the
most extreme cases). C and SiO2 grains show moderate to strong sputtering as
well, with 38% and 80% mass loss. The survival rate of grains formed by early

dust, coupled through viscous drag in both non-stiff and stiff regimes. To
account for the effects of dust drag in the update of the fluid quantities, we
employ a fluid description of the dust component and study the modified
gas-dust hyperbolic system following the approach in Miniati & Colella (2007).
In addition to two entropy waves for the gas and dust components, respectively,
the extended system includes three waves driven partially by gas pressure and
partially by dust drift, which, in the limit of vanishing coupling, tend to the
two original acoustic waves and the unhindered dust streaming. Based on this
analysis we formulate a predictor step providing first order accurate
reconstruction of the time-averaged state variables at cell interfaces, whence
a second order accurate estimate of the conservative fluxes can be obtained
through a suitable linearized Riemann solver. The final source term update is
carried out using a one-step, second order accurate, L-stable, predictor
corrector asymptotic method (the alpha-QSS method suggested by Mott et. al.
2000). This procedure completely defines a two-fluid method for gas-dust
system. Using the updated fluid solution allows us to then advance the
individual particle solutions, including self-consistently the time evolution
of the gas velocity in the estimate of the drag force. This is done with a
suitable particle scheme also based on the alpha-QSS method. A set of benchmark
problems shows that our method is stable and convergent. When dust is modeled
as a fluid (two-fluid) second order accuracy is achieved in both stiff and
non-stiff regimes, whereas when dust is modeled with particles (hybrid) second
order is achieved in the non-stiff regime and first order otherwise.

Spitzer Space Telescope observations were used. It is likely that the SFR ON 2
and Berkeley 87 are at the same distance, 1.23 kpc, and hence are associated.
The XMM-Newton observations detected X-rays from massive stars in Berkeley 87
as well as diffuse emission from the SFR ON 2. The two patches of diffuse X-ray
emission are encompassed in the shell-like H II region GAL 75.84+0.40 in the
northern part of ON 2 and in the ON 2S region in the southern part of ON 2. The
diffuse emission from GAL 75.84+0.40 suffers an absorption column equivalent to
A_V approx. 28 mag. Its spectrum can be fitted either with a thermal plasma
model at T < 30 MK or by an absorbed power-law model with gamma; approx. -2.6.
The X-ray luminosity of GAL 75.84+0.40 is L_X approx. 6 10^31 erg/s. The
diffuse emission from ON 2S is adjacent to the ultra-compact H II (UCHII)
region Cygnus 2N, but does not coincide with it or with any other known UCHII
region. It has a luminosity of L_X approx. 4 10^31 erg/s. The spectrum can be
fitted with an absorbed power-law model with gamma; approx.-1.4. We adopt the
view of Turner and Forbes (1982) that the SFR ON 2 is physically associated
with the massive star cluster Berkeley 87 hosting the WO type star WR 142. We
discuss different explanations for the apparently diffuse X-ray emission in
these SFRs. These include synchrotron radiation, invoked by the co-existence of
strongly shocked stellar winds and turbulent magnetic fields in the
star-forming complex, cluster wind emission, or an unresolved population of
discrete sources.

data obtained in conjunction with the laser guide star adaptive optics system
on the W.M. Keck II 10 m telescope. Fifteen systems have undergone sufficient
orbital motion, allowing us to derive their relative orbital parameters and
hence their total system mass. These measurements triple the number of masses
for VLM objects. Among the 11 systems with both astrometric and spectroscopic
measurements, six have sufficient radial velocity variations to allow us to
obtain individual component masses. This is the first derivation of the
component masses for five of these systems. Altogether, the orbital solutions
of these low mass systems show a correlation between eccentricity and orbital
period, consistent with their higher mass counterparts. In our primary
analysis, we find that there are systematic discrepancies between our dynamical
mass measurements and the predictions of theoretical evolutionary models
(TUCSON and LYON) with both models either underpredicting or overpredicting the
most precisely determined dynamical masses. These discrepancies are a function
of spectral type, with late M through mid L systems tending to have their
masses underpredicted, while one T type system has its mass overpredicted.
These discrepancies imply that either the temperatures predicted by
evolutionary and atmosphere models are inconsistent for an object of a given
mass, or the mass-radius relationship or cooling timescales predicted by the
evolutionary models are incorrect. If these spectral type trends hold into the
planetary mass regime, the implication is that the masses of directly imaged
extrasolar planets are overpredicted by the evolutionary models.

span a range in H/R from 0.06 to 0.17. We contrast these simulations with two
previously reported simulations in a Schwarzschild spacetime in order to
investigate possible dependence of the inner disk stress on magnetic topology.
In all cases, much care was devoted to technical issues: ensuring adequate
resolution and azimuthal extent, and averaging only over those time-periods
when the accretion flow is in approximate inflow equilibrium. We find that the
time-averaged radial-dependence of fluid-frame electromagnetic stress is almost
completely independent of both disk thickness and poloidal magnetic topology.
It rises smoothly inward at all radii (exhibiting no feature associated with
the ISCO) until just outside the event horizon, where the stress plummets to
zero. Reynolds stress can also be significant near the ISCO and in the plunging
region; the magnitude of this stress, however, depends on both disk thickness

momentum accreted per unit rest-mass 7-15% less than the angular momentum of

group is that the time translations constitute a central subgroup. Therewith,
in unitary irreducible representations (UIR) of the group, the Hamiltonian
appears as a Casimir operator proportional to the identity H = EI, with E (and

are a heterogeneous group of objects, with disk masses ranging from < 0.6 to 40
M_JUP and accretion rates ranging from <1E-11 1E-7 M_solar/yr, but most tend to
have much lower masses and accretion rates than ""full disks"" (i.e., disks
without opacity holes). Eight of our targets have stellar companions: 6 of them
are binaries and the other 2 are triple systems. In four cases, the stellar
companions are close enough to suspect they are responsible for the inferred
inner holes. We find that 9 of our 26 targets have low disk mass (< 2.5 M_JUP)
and negligible accretion (< 1E-11) M_solar/yr, and are thus consistent with
photoevaporating (or photoevaporated) disks. Four of these 9 non-accreting
objects have fractional disk luminosities < 1E-3 and could already be in a
debris disk stage. Seventeen of our transition disks are accreting. Thirteen of
these accreting objects are consistent with grain growth. The remaining 4
accreting objects have SEDs suggesting the presence of sharp inner holes, and
thus are excellent candidates for harboring giant planets.

approach is based on a unitary transformation and does not require the
rotating-wave approximation. We show that for low-frequency noise, the bath
shifts the qubit energy towards higher energies (blue shift), while the
ordinary high-frequency cutoff Ohmic bath shifts the qubit energy towards lower
energies (red shift). In order to preserve the coherence of the qubit, we also
investigate the quantum Zeno effect in two cases: low- and high-frequency
baths. For very frequent projective measurements, the low-frequency bath gives
rise to the quantum anti-Zeno effect on the qubit. The quantum Zeno effect only
occurs in the high-frequency cutoff Ohmic bath, after considering
counter-rotating terms. For a high-frequency environment, the decay rate should
be faster (without frequent measurements) or slower (with frequent
measurements, in the Zeno regime), compared to the low-frequency bath case. The
experimental implementation of our results here could distinguish the type of
bath (either a low- or high-frequency one) and protect the coherence of the
qubit by modulating the dominant frequency of its environment.

from Ru(0001) and Ir(111) by reaction with oxygen. We find two mechanisms on
Ru(0001). At short times, oxygen reacts with carbon monomers on the surrounding
Ru surface, decreasing their concentration below the equilibrium value. This
undersaturation causes a flux of carbon from graphene to the monomer gas. In
this initial mechanism, graphene is etched at a rate that is given precisely by
the same non-linear dependence on carbon monomer concentration that governs
growth. Thus, during both growth and etching, carbon attaches and detaches to
graphene as clusters of several carbon atoms. At later times, etching
accelerates. We present evidence that this process involves intercalated
oxygen, which destabilizes graphene. On Ir, this mechanism creates observable
holes. It also occurs mostly quickly near wrinkles in the graphene islands,
depends on the orientation of the graphene with respect to the Ir substrate,
and, in contrast to the first mechanism, can increase the density of carbon
monomers. We also observe that both layers of bilayer graphene islands on Ir
etch together, not sequentially.

cycle is the Verification and Validation of the software. The purpose of this
work is to show an example of procedures, test development and analysis
successfully applied to a key software project of an ESA mission. We present
the end-to-end validation tests performed on the Level 1 of the LFI-DPC, by
detailing the methods used and the results obtained. Different approaches have
been used to test the scientific and housekeeping data processing. Scientific
data processing has been tested by injecting signals with known properties
directly into the acquisition electronics, in order to generate a test dataset
of real telemetry data and reproduce as much as possible nominal conditions.
For the HK telemetry processing, validation software have been developed to
inject known parameter values into a set of real housekeeping packets and
perform a comparison with the corresponding timelines generated by the Level 1.
With the proposed validation and verification procedure, where the on-board and
ground processing are viewed as a single pipeline, we demonstrated that the
scientific and housekeeping processing of the Planck-LFI raw data is correct
and meets the project requirements.

dunes and ripples and ejects fine dust particles into the atmosphere on both
Earth and Mars. While the wind speed at which saltation is initiated, the fluid
threshold, has been studied extensively, the wind speed at which it is halted,
the impact threshold, has been poorly quantified for Mars conditions. We
present an analytical model of the impact threshold, which we show to be in
agreement with measurements and recent numerical simulations for Earth
conditions. For Mars conditions, we find that the impact threshold is
approximately an order of magnitude below the fluid threshold, in agreement
with previous studies. Saltation on Mars can thus be sustained at wind speeds
an order of magnitude less than required to initiate it, leading to the
occurrence of hysteresis. These results confirm earlier simulations with a
detailed numerical saltation model, and have important implications for the
formation of sand dunes, ripples, and dust storms on Mars.

tribosystems (deterministic surface) is an intriguing goal. Inspirations for
such surfaces come from studying natural systems and deducing design rules. The
major attraction is that natural systems, while functionally complex, are, in
general, of optimized shape and performance. It is further believed that
functional complexity of natural systems is what affords natural species to
morph continuously to adapt with the operating environment. One bio-species
that is of interest is the Ball Python. This is because such a species
continuously slides against various surfaces, many of which are deemed
tribologically hostile, without sustaining much damage. Much of the success of
that species in adapting to its environment is attributed to surface design
features. In that respect, studying these features and how do they contribute
to the control of friction and wear is very attractive. This paper is a step in
this direction. In this work we apply a multi scale surface characterization
approach to study surface design features of the Python Regius. The focus is on
those features that are typically used to assess the performance of high
quality lubricating surfaces. To this end, topographical features are studied
by SEM and through White Light Interferrometery (WLI). We probe the roughness
of the surface on multi scale and as a function of location within the body. In
addition we draw a comparison of these features to those of human skin.

depends largely on comparing the mass and radius with the composition expected

mass-radius relation which relies heavily on equations of state calculated from
electronic structure theory and measured experimentally on Earth. We lay out a
method for deriving and testing equations of state, and deduce mass-radius and
mass-pressure relations for key materials whose equation of state is reasonably
well established, and for differentiated Fe/rock. We find that variations in
the equation of state, such as may arise when extrapolating from low pressure
data, can have significant effects on predicted mass- radius relations, and on
planetary pressure profiles. The relations are compared with the observed
masses and radii of planets and exoplanets. Kepler-10b is apparently 'Earth-
like,' likely with a proportionately larger core than Earth's, nominally 2/3 of
the mass of the planet. CoRoT-7b is consistent with a rocky mantle over an
Fe-based core which is likely to be proportionately smaller than Earth's. GJ
1214b lies between the mass-radius curves for H2O and CH4, suggesting an 'icy'
composition with a relatively large core or a relatively large proportion of
H2O. CoRoT-2b is less dense than the hydrogen relation, which could be
explained by an anomalously high degree of heating or by higher than assumed
atmospheric opacity. HAT-P-2b is slightly denser than the mass-radius relation
for hydrogen, suggesting the presence of a significant amount of matter of
higher atomic number. CoRoT-3b lies close to the hydrogen relation. The
pressure at the center of Kepler-10b is 1.5+1.2-1.0 TPa. The central pressure
in CoRoT-7b is probably close to 0.8TPa, though may be up to 2TPa.

extracted by combining optics, neutron scattering, ARPES and tunnelling
measurements. These methods give convincing evidence for strong electron-phonon
interaction (EPI) with the coupling constant between 1-3 in cuprates near
optimal doping. Here we clarify how these results are in favor of the
Eliashberg-like theory for HTSC cuprates near optimal doping. In Part II we
discuss some theoretical ingredients - such as strong EPI, strong correlations
- which are necessary to explain the experimental results related to the
mechanism of d-wave pairing in optimally doped cuprates. These comprise the
Migdal-Eliashberg theory for EPI in strongly correlated systems which give rise
to the forward scattering peak. The latter is further supported by the weakly
screened Madelung interaction in the ionic-metallic structure of layered
cuprates. In this approach EPI is responsible for the strength of pairing while
the residual Coulomb interaction (by including spin fluctuations) triggers the
d-wave pairing.

sector, using the expected high-energy neutrino flux from distant cosmological
sources such as active galaxies. For this purpose we have assumed three
different hypotheses for the neutrino production model, characterised by the
flavour fluxes at production \phi_e^0:\phi_\mu^0:\phi_\tau^0 = 1:2:0, 0:1:0,
and 1:0:0, and studied the theoretical and experimental expectations for the
muon-neutrino flux at Earth, \phi_\mu, and for the flavour ratios at Earth, R =
\phi_\mu/\phi_e and S = \phi_\tau/\phi_\mu. CPT violation (CPTV) has been
implemented by adding an energy-independent term to the standard neutrino
oscillation Hamiltonian. This introduces three new mixing angles, two new
eigenvalues and three new phases, all of which have currently unknown values.
We have varied the new mixing angles and eigenvalues within certain bounds,
together with the parameters associated to pure standard oscillations. Our
results indicate that, for the models 1:2:0 and 0:1:0, it might possible to
find large deviations for \phi_\mu, R, and S between the cases without and with
CPTV, provided the CPTV eigenvalues lie within 10^{-29}-10^{-27} GeV, or above.
Moreover, if CPTV exists, there are certain values of R and S that can be
accounted for by up to three production models. If no CPTV were observed, we
could set limits on the CPTV eigenvalues of the same order. Detection prospects
calculated using IceCube suggest that for the models 1:2:0 and 0:1:0, the
modifications due to CPTV are larger and more clearly separable from the
standard-oscillations predictions. We conclude that IceCube is potentially able
to detect CPTV but that, depending on the values of the CPTV parameters, there
could be a mis-determination of the neutrino production model.

sequence have long been believed to lack observable surface convection,
although evolutionary models of A-type stars do predict very thin surface
convective zones. We present evidence for granulation in two delta Scuti stars
of spectral type A2: HD174936 and HD50844. Recent analyses of space-based CoRoT
(Convection, Rotation, and planetary Transits) data revealed up to some 1000
frequencies in the photometry of these stars. The frequencies were interpreted
as individual pulsation modes. If true, there must be large numbers of
nonradial modes of very high degree l which should suffer cancellation effects
in disk-integrated photometry (even of high space-based precision). The p-mode
interpretation of all the frequencies in HD174936 and HD50844 depends on the
assumption of white (frequency independent) noise. Our independent analyses of
the data provide an alternative explanation: most of the peaks in the Fourier
spectra are the signature of non-white granulation background noise, and less
than about 100 of the frequencies are actual stellar p-modes in each star. We
find granulation time scales which are consistent with scaling relations that
describe cooler stars with known surface convection. If the granulation
interpretation is correct, the hundreds of low-amplitude Fourier peaks reported
in recent studies are falsely interpreted as independent pulsation modes and a
significantly lower number of frequencies are associated with pulsation,
consistent with only modes of low degree.

filamentary structure, as seen by STEREO-A and B. The technique uses a pair of

geometrically transformed to STEREO-A view so that the background images appear
similar. Filaments being elevated structures, i.e., not lying on the same
spherical surface as background features, do not appear similar in the

Way-mass galaxies to study the relative importance of the main stellar
components, i.e., discs, bulges, and bars, at redshift zero. The main aim of
this work is to understand if estimates of the structural parameters of these
components determined from kinematics (as is usually done in simulations) agree
well with those obtained using a photometric bulge/disc/bar decomposition (as
done in observations). To perform such a comparison, we have produced synthetic
observations of the simulation outputs with the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer
code SUNRISE and used the BUDDA code to make 2D photometric decompositions of
the resulting images (in the i and g bands). We find that the kinematic
disc-to-total ratio (D/T) estimates are systematically and significantly lower
than the photometric ones. While the maximum D/T ratios obtained with the
former method are of the order of 0.2, they are typically >0.4, and can be as
high as 0.7, according to the latter. The photometric decomposition shows that
many of the simulated galaxies have bars, with Bar/T ratios in the range
0.2-0.4, and that bulges have in all cases low Sersic indices, resembling
observed pseudo-bulges instead of classical ones. Simulated discs, bulges and
bars generally have similar (g-i) colours, which are in the blue tail of the
distribution of observed colours. This is not due to the presence of young
stars, but rather to low metallicities and poor gas content in the simulated
galaxies, which makes dust extinction low. Photometric decompositions thus
match the component ratios usually quoted for spiral galaxies better than
kinematic decompositions, but the shift is insufficient to make the simulations
consistent with observed late-type systems.

pre-biotic reactions to occur. In this paper, we investigate the stochastic

of the autocatalytic reactions gives rise to large sustained oscillations, even
when the number of constituents is quite large. These oscillations are
spatio-temporal in nature, unlike those found in previous studies, which
consisted only of temporal oscillations. We speculate that these oscillations
may have a role in seeding membrane instabilities which lead to vesicle

The four BLAST cores appear to be colder and more quiescent than other

of the ESA and NASA- the laser frequency noise must be suppressed below the
secondary noises such as the optical path noise, acceleration noise etc. By
combining six appropriately time-delayed data streams containing fractional
Doppler shifts - a technique called time delay interferometry (TDI) - the laser
frequency noise may be adequately suppressed. We consider the general model of
LISA where the armlengths vary with time, so that second generation TDI are
relevant. However, we must envisage the possibility, that not all the optical
links of LISA will be operating at all times, and therefore, we here consider
the case of LISA operating with two arms only. As shown earlier in the
literature, obtaining even approximate solutions of TDI to the general problem
is very difficult. Since here only four optical links are relevant, the
algebraic problem simplifies considerably. We are then able to exhibit a large
number of solutions (from mathematical point of view an infinite number) and
further present an algorithm to generate these solutions.

At a doping level of x = 0.1, we get a maximum transition temperature Tc of

recent fire (i.e. plant age) in the Sydney region. Significant variation among

only), the number of follicles/bracts produced per cone, and the number of
seeds lost/released due to spontaneous fruit rupture. Thus, three different

that cumulene wires with odd number of carbon atoms yield the highest

high density of states in broad LUMO levels spanning the Fermi level of the

diffuse radio emission and the polarization of starlight. The asymmetry of the

and the presence of aurorae are obtained from these images. The median sky
brightness of moonless clear nights is 20.5 mag arcsec^{-2} in the SDSS $i$
band at the South Celestial Pole (which includes a contribution of about 0.06
mag from diffuse Galactic light). The median over all Moon phases in the
Antarctic winter is about 19.8 mag arcsec^{-2}. There were no thick clouds in
2008. We model contributions of the Sun and the Moon to the sky background to
obtain the relationship between the sky brightness and transparency. Aurorae
are identified by comparing the observed sky brightness to the sky brightness
expected from this model. About 2% of the images are affected by relatively
strong aurorae.

behavior of such specimens. We find that this synthesis yields particles made
up of rods whose diameter appears to be controllable by the fraction of TEA
during synthesis. It is seen that the two well-known magnetic transitions (near
24 and 8 K) remain unaffected for all TEA concentrations used. The most notable
finding is that the multi-step feature in the M versus magnetic-field isotherm
reported for single crystalline form tends to smoothen out gradually with
decreasing rod thickness (from about 1 micron to about a few hundred nm).
Further, unlike for the single crystalline form known in the literature, there
is no tendency for the relaxation time (tau) to remain constant at low
temperatures (<10 K) and tau remains temperature dependent up to the lowest
temperature measured (1.8K) in all the specimens. These findings suggest that
the multistep magnetization anomaly in this system may be characterized by a
magnetic correlation length.

  Space Telescope Observations of the 12 micron Sample of Active Galaxies","78 pages, 13 figures",,"10.1088/0067-0049/187/1/172",,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  The mid-far-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 83 active
galaxies, mostly Seyfert galaxies, selected from the extended 12 micron sample
are presented. The data were collected using all three instruments, IRAC, IRS,
and MIPS, aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. The IRS data were obtained in
spectral mapping mode, and the photometric data from IRAC and IRS were
extracted from matched, 20 arcsec diameter circular apertures. The MIPS data
were obtained in SED mode, providing very low resolution spectroscopy (R ~ 20)
between ~ 55 and 90 microns in a larger, 20 by 30 arcsec synthetic aperture. We
further present the data from a spectral decomposition of the SEDs, including
equivalent widths and fluxes of key emission lines; silicate 10 and 18 micron
emission and absorption strengths; IRAC magnitudes; and mid-far infrared
spectral indices. Finally, we examine the SEDs averaged within optical
classifications of activity. We find that the infrared SEDs of Seyfert 1s and
Seyfert 2s with hidden broad line regions (HBLR, as revealed by
spectropolarimetry or other technique) are qualitatively similar, except that
Seyfert 1s show silicate emission and HBLR Seyfert 2s show silicate absorption.
The infrared SEDs of other classes with the 12 micron sample, including Seyfert
1.8-1.9, non-HBLR Seyfert 2 (not yet shown to hide a type 1 nucleus), LINER and
HII galaxies, appear to be dominated by star-formation, as evidenced by blue
IRAC colors, strong PAH emission, and strong far-infrared continuum emission,
measured relative to mid-infrared continuum emission.

  Joliot-Curie School, Lacanau, France, 27 Sept.-3 Oct. 2009",,,,"nucl-th nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent achievements in nuclear forces theory open new perspectives for the
next decade of low energy nuclear physics, bringing together people from very
different communities. Although many developments remain to be done, the
possibility to directly use QCD to describe nuclear system is a major challenge
that is within reach. In this introduction to the 2009 International
Joliot-Curie School (EJC2009), new trends in the strong nuclear interaction are
summarized starting from quarks and ending with finite or infinite nuclear
systems. At different energy scales, selected new concepts and ideas have been
discussed in a rather simple way. Recent advances in the theory of nuclear
forces, thanks to chiral perturbation and effective field theories, have led to
a new generation of strong nuclear interaction particularly suited to low
energy nuclear physics. The interesting aspects of new interactions compared to
conventional forces are underlined. Recent achievements in ab initio theories
that directly start from the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction and their key
role to understand the three-body force are illustrated. Finally, future
perspectives for standard nuclear physics theories, namely Shell Model and
Energy Density Functional, are discussed.
