It consists of an introductory text followed by two separate parts which are
loosely related but may be read independently of each other. In Part I we
analyze certain hyperbolic structures arising when studying gravity in the
vicinity of a spacelike singularity (the ""BKL-limit""). In this limit, spatial
points decouple and the dynamics exhibits ultralocal behaviour which may be
described in terms of a (possibly chaotic) hyperbolic billiard. In all
supergravities arising as low-energy limits of string theory or M-theory, the
billiard dynamics takes place within the fundamental Weyl chambers of certain
hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras, suggesting that these algebras generate hidden
infinite-dimensional symmetries of the theory. Part II of the thesis is devoted
to a study of how (U-)dualities in string theory provide powerful constraints
on perturbative and non-perturbative quantum corrections. These dualities are
described by certain arithmetic groups G(Z) which are conjectured to be
preserved in the effective action. The exact couplings are given by automorphic
forms on the double quotient G(Z)\G/K. We discuss in detail various methods of
constructing automorphic forms, with particular emphasis on non-holomorphic
Eisenstein series. We provide detailed examples for the physically relevant
cases of SL(2,Z) and SL(3,Z), for which we construct their respective
Eisenstein series and compute their (non-abelian) Fourier expansions. We also
show how these techniques can be applied to hypermultiplet moduli spaces in
type II Calabi-Yau compactifications, and we provide a detailed analysis for
the universal hypermultiplet.

towards the unit interval is given by the base 2 expansion of real numbers,

doubling map with an n-dimensional generalization of the tent map; this allows
us to define Kakutani-von Neumann transformations in simplexes of arbitrary

bijections), whose orbits are all uniformly distributed; in particular, they
are uniquely ergodic w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. The forward orbit of a
certain vertex provides an enumeration of all points in the simplex having
dyadic coordinates, and this enumeration can be translated via the
n-dimensional Minkowski function to an enumeration of all rational points. In
the course of establishing the above results, we introduce a family of

are the components of an orbital scheme, itself constructed by intersecting a
nilpotent orbit with a Borel subalgebra. Their multidegrees, known as Joseph
polynomials, give a basis of a (Springer) representation of the Weyl group. In
the case of the nilpotent orbit $\{ M^2=0 \}$, the orbital varieties can be
indexed by noncrossing chord diagrams in the disc. In this paper we study the
normal cone to the orbital scheme inside this nilpotent orbit $\{ M^2 = 0 \}$.
This gives a better-motivated construction of the Brauer loop scheme we
introduced in [KZJ07], whose components are indexed by all chord diagrams (now
possibly with crossings) in the disc. The multidegrees of its components, the
Brauer loop varieties, were shown to reproduce the ground state of the Brauer
loop model in statistical mechanics [DFZJ06]. Here, we reformulate and slightly
generalize these multidegrees in order to express them as solutions of the
rational quantum Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation associated to the Brauer
algebra. In particular, the vector of the multidegrees satisfies two sets of
equations, corresponding to the $e_i$ and $f_i$ generators of the Brauer
algebra. We describe here the geometric meaning of both $e_i$ and $f_i$
equations in our slightly extended setting. We also describe the corresponding
actions at the level of orbital varieties: while only the $e_i$ equations make
sense directly on the Joseph polynomials, the $f_i$ equations also appear if
one introduces a broader class of varieties. We explain the connection of the
latter with matrix Schubert varieties.

neutron star, it may contain a high density of flux tubes, carrying flux that
is mostly color-magnetic, with a small admixture of ordinary magnetic flux. We
focus on the two-flavor color-superconducting (""2SC"") phase, and assume that
the flux tubes are energetically stable, although this has not yet been
demonstrated. The density of flux tubes depends on the nature of the transition
to the color-superconducting phase, and could be within an order of magnitude
of the density of magnetic flux tubes that would be found if the core were
superconducting nuclear matter. We calculate the cross-section for
Aharonov-Bohm scattering of gapless fermions off the flux tubes, and the
associated collision time and frictional force on a moving flux tube. We
discuss the other forces on the flux tube, and find that if we take in to
account only the forces that arise within the 2SC core region then the
timescale for expulsion of the color flux tubes from the 2SC core is of order
10^10 years.

because recording detailed information about every request to a heavily used

perspective on queueing models in which the arrival and departure times that

the observation that a queueing model defines a deterministic transformation
between the data and a set of independent variables called the service times.
With this viewpoint in hand, we sample from the posterior distribution over
missing data and model parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We evaluate
our framework on data from a benchmark Web application. We also present a
simple technique for selection among nested queueing models. We are unaware of

density of an Abelian sandpile model (ASM) and the transition point of its
corresponding deterministic fixed-energy sandpile model (DFES). Being
deterministic, the configuration space of a DFES can be divided into two
disjoint classes such that every configuration in one class should evolve into
one of absorbing states, whereas no configurations in the other class can reach
an absorbing state. Since the two classes are separated in terms of toppling
dynamics, the system can be made to exhibit an absorbing phase transition (APT)
at various points that depend on the initial probability distribution of the
configurations. Furthermore, we show that in general the transition point also
depends on whether an infinite-size limit is taken before or after the
infinite-time limit. To demonstrate, we numerically study the two-dimensional
DFES with Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld toppling rule (BTW-FES). We confirm that there
are indeed many thresholds. Nonetheless, the critical phenomena at various
transition points are found to be universal. We furthermore discuss a
microscopic absorbing phase transition, or a so-called spreading dynamics, of
the BTW-FES, to find that the phase transition in this setting is related to
the dynamical isotropic percolation process rather than self-organized
criticality. In particular, we argue that choosing recurrent configurations of
the corresponding ASM as an initial configuration does not allow for a
nontrivial APT in the DFES.

Memory System). PEMS executes Bulk-Synchronous Parallel (BSP) algorithms in an
External Memory (EM) context, enabling computation with very large data sets
which exceed the size of main memory. Many parallel algorithms have been
designed and implemented for Bulk-Synchronous Parallel models of computation.
Such algorithms generally assume that the entire data set is stored in main
memory at once. PEMS overcomes this limitation without requiring any
modification to the algorithm by using disk space as memory for additional
""virtual processors"". Previous work has shown this to be a promising approach
which scales well as computational resources (i.e. processors and disks) are
added. However, the technique incurs significant overhead when compared with
purpose-built EM algorithms. PEMS2 introduces refinements to the simulation
process intended to reduce this overhead as well as the amount of disk space
required to run the simulation. New functionality is also introduced, including
asynchronous I/O and support for multi-core processors. Experimental results
show that these changes significantly improve the runtime of the simulation.
PEMS2 narrows the performance gap between simulated BSP algorithms and their
hand-crafted EM counterparts, providing a practical system for using BSP
algorithms with data sets which exceed the size of RAM.

asymmetric co-existence, and symmetric co-existence. At the asymmetric
co-existence level, the secondary network selectively deactivates its users
based on knowledge of the interference and channel gains, whereas at the
symmetric level, the primary network also schedules its users in the same way.
Our aim is to derive optimal sum-rates (i.e., throughputs)of both networks at
each co-existence level as the number of users grows asymptotically and
evaluate how the sum-rates scale with network size. In order to find the
asymptotic throughput results, we derive a key lemma on extreme order
statistics and a proposition on the sum of lower order statistics. As a
baseline comparison, we calculate the sum-rates for channel sharing via
time-division (TD). We compare the asymptotic secondary sum-rate in TD with
that under simultaneous transmission, while ensuring the primary network
maintains the same throughput in both cases. The results indicate that
simultaneous transmission at both asymmetric and symmetric co-existence levels
can outperform TD. Furthermore, this enhancement is achievable when uplink
activation or deactivation of users is based only on the interference gains to
the opposite network and not on a network's own channel gains.

will say that those classes are realizable for the group G; it is conjectured
that the set of realizable classes is always a group.

to study some l-groups, where l is an odd prime number. In particular, together
with [1] we will complete the study of realizable Steinitz classes for groups

towards the Raman spectrum of bilayer graphene for the incoming photon energy
Omega >> 1eV. Starting with the four-band tight-binding model, we derive an
effective scattering amplitude that can be incorporated into the commonly used
two-band approximation. Due to the influence of the high-energy bands, this
effective scattering amplitude is different from the contact interaction
amplitude obtained within the two-band model alone. We then calculate the
spectral density of the inelastic light scattering accompanied by the
excitation of electron-hole pairs in bilayer graphene. In the absence of a
magnetic field, due to the parabolic dispersion of the low-energy bands in a
bilayer crystal, this contribution is constant and in doped structures has a
threshold at twice the Fermi energy. In an external magnetic field, the
dominant Raman-active modes are the n_{-} to n_{+} inter-Landau-level
transitions with crossed polarisation of in/out photons. We estimate the
quantum efficiency of a single n_{-} to n_{+} transition in the magnetic field
of 10T as I_{n_{-} to n_{+}}~10^{-12}.

exploit the higher signal-to-noise, spatial and temporal resolution of the EUVI

plumes in high detail. We employ recently developed insight from imaging (and
spectral) diagnostics of active region, plage, and quiet Sun plasmas to
identify the presence of apparent motions as high-speed upflows in magnetic
regions as opposed to previous interpretations of propagating waves. In almost
all polar plumes observed at the limb in these STEREO sequences, in all coronal
passbands, we observe high speed jets of plasma traveling along the structures
with a mean velocity of 135km/s at a range of temperatures from 0.5-1.5MK. The
jets have an apparent brightness enhancement of ~5% above that of the plumes
they travel on and repeat quasi-periodically, with repeat-times ranging from
five to twenty-five minutes. We also notice a very weak, fine scale, rapidly
evolving, but ubiquitous companion of the plumes that covers the entire coronal
hole limb. The observed jets are remarkably similar in intensity enhancement,
periodicity and velocity to those observed in other magnetic regions of the
solar atmosphere. They are multi-thermal in nature. We infer that the jets
observed on the plumes are a source of heated mass to the fast solar wind.
Further, based on the previous results that motivated this study, we suggest
that these jets originated in the upper chromosphere.

against an adversary that is both an eavesdropper and a jammer. The network is
assumed to transport n packets from source to each receiver, and the adversary
is allowed to eavesdrop on \mu arbitrarily chosen links and also to inject up
to t erroneous packets into the network. The goal of the system is to achieve
zero-error communication that is information-theoretically secure from the
adversary. Moreover, this goal must be attained in a universal fashion, i.e.,
regardless of the network topology or the underlying network code. An upper
bound on the achievable rate under these requirements is shown to be n-\mu-2t
packets per transmission. A scheme is proposed that can achieve this maximum
rate, for any n and any field size q, provided the packet length m is at least
n symbols. The scheme is based on rank-metric codes and admits low-complexity
encoding and decoding. In addition, the scheme is shown to be optimal in the
sense that the required packet length is the smallest possible among all
universal schemes that achieve the maximum rate.

tackle the obstacles on the way up, and reach the summit. In a similar vein,
one of the immediate goals of contemporary theoretical physics is to build a

applying this concept to the cell border situation, in which two mobile nodes

Our spectroscopically selected sample has $\sim$0.1 magnitude bluer median

dwarfs, which reflects a bias towards redder L dwarfs in past selection

with SDSS/2MASS proper motions in order to examine the tangential velocities.

present three dimensional kinematics. We also provide H$\alpha$ detections for
the fraction of our sample with sufficient quality spectra. Comparison of the
velocities of our L dwarf sample to a kinematic model shows evidence for both
cold and hot dynamical populations, consistent with young and old disk
components. The dispersions of these components are similar to those found for

outer extrasolar planetary systems, at radii beyond 5 AU. Our hypothesis is
that dynamical evolution in outer planetary systems is controlled by a
combination of planet-planet scattering and planetary interactions with an
exterior disk of small bodies (""planetesimals""). Using 5,000 long duration
N-body simulations, we follow the evolution of three planets surrounded by a 50
Earth mass primordial planetesimal disk. For large planet masses (above that of
Saturn) the influence of the disk is modest, and we recover the observed
eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets (observed primarily at smaller
radii). We explain the observed mass dependence of the eccentricity by invoking
strong correlations between planet masses in the same system. For lower mass
planets we observe diverse dynamical behavior: strong scattering events, sudden
jumps in eccentricity due to resonance crossings, and re-circularization of
scattered low-mass planets in the disk. We present distributions of the final
eccentricity and inclination, and discuss how they vary with planet mass and
initial system architecture. We predict a transition to lower eccentricities
for low mass planets at radii where disks influence the dynamics. Radial
velocity measurements capable of detecting planets with K~5 m/s and periods in
excess of 10 years will constrain this regime. We also study the population of
resonant and non-resonant multiple planet systems. We show that, among systems
with Jupiter-mass planets that avoid close encounters, the planetesimal disk
acts as a damping mechanism that frequently populates mean motion resonances.
Resonant chains ought to be common among massive planets in outer planetary
systems.

compute nodes. In order to study the distribution of dark matter in a
cosmological simulation, the dark matter halos must be identified using a halo
finder, which establishes the halo membership of every particle in the
simulation. The resources required for halo finding are similar to the
requirements for the simulation itself. In particular, simulations have become
too extensive to use commonly-employed halo finders, such that the
computational requirements to identify halos must now be spread across multiple
nodes and cores. Here we present a scalable-parallel halo finding method called
Parallel HOP for large-scale cosmological simulation data. Based on the halo
finder HOP, it utilizes MPI and domain decomposition to distribute the halo
finding workload across multiple compute nodes, enabling analysis of much
larger datasets than is possible with the strictly serial or previous parallel
implementations of HOP. We provide a reference implementation of this method as

0.04. Both the stacked limits, and the limits from the Monte Carlo simulation
suggest that the average ionizing emissivity (relative to non-ionizing UV
emissivity) at z~1.3 is significantly lower than has been observed in Lyman
Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z~3. If the ionizing emissivity of star-forming
galaxies is in fact increasing with redshift, it would help to explain the high
photoionization rates seen in the IGM at z>4 and reionization of the
intergalactic medium at z>6. [Abridged]

Carinae collected via SMARTS observations using the CTIO 1.5 m telescope and
echelle spectrograph. Our observations were made almost every night over a two
month interval around the predicted minimum of eta Car. We observed a
significant fading of the line emission that reached a minimum seven days after
the X-ray minimum. About 17 d prior to the H-alpha flux minimum, the H-alpha
profile exhibited the emergence of a broad, P Cygni type, absorption component
(near a Doppler shift of -500 km/s) and a narrow absorption component (near
-144 km/s and probably associated with intervening gas from the Little
Homunculus Nebula). All these features were observed during the last event in
2003.5 and are probably related to the close periastron passage of the
companion. We argue that these variations are consistent with qualitative
expectations about changes in the primary star's stellar wind that result from
the wind-wind collision with a massive binary companion and from atmospheric
eclipses of the companion.

probe of both the HI and HeII reionisation epochs. Current constraints on the
IGM temperature from the Lya forest are restricted to the redshift range
2<z<4.5, limiting the ability to probe the thermal memory of HI reionisation
toward higher redshift. In this work, we present the first direct measurement
of the IGM temperature around a z=6 quasar by analysing the Doppler widths of
Lya absorption lines in the proximity zone of SDSS J0818+1722. We use a high
resolution (R= 40000) Keck/HIRES spectrum in combination with detailed
numerical modelling to obtain the temperature at mean density,
T_0=23600\pm^5000_6900K (\pm^9200_9300K) at 68 (95) per cent confidence
assuming a prior probability 13500K<T_0<38500 K following HI and HeII
reionisation. This enables us to place an upper limit on the redshift of HI
reionisation, z_H, within 33 comoving Mpc of SDSS J0818+1722. If the quasar
reionises the HeII in its vicinity, then in the limit of instantaneous
reionisation we infer z_H<9.0 (11.0) at 68 (95) per cent confidence assuming
photoheating is the dominant heat source and that HI reionisation is driven by
ionising sources with soft spectra, typical of population II stars. If the HI
and HeII in the IGM around SDSS J0818+1722 are instead reionised simultaneously
by a population of massive metal-free stars, characterised by very hard
ionising spectra, we obtain a tighter upper limit of z_H<8.4 (9.4). Initiating
reionisation at higher redshifts produces temperatures which are too low with
respect to our constraint unless the HI ionising sources or the quasar itself
have spectra significantly harder than typically assumed.

produced from a hydrodynamical calculation. We find that when the gas,
initially comprising 60% of the mass, is removed, the system settles into a
bound cluster containing 30-40% of the stellar mass surrounding by an expanding
halo of ejected stars. The bound cluster expands from an initial radius of
<0.05 pc to 1-2 pc over 4-10 Myr, depending on how quickly the gas is removed,
implying that stellar clusters may begin with far higher stellar densities than
usually assumed. With rapid gas dispersal the most massive stars are found to
be mass segregated for the first ~1 Myr of evolution, but classical mass
segregation only develops for cases with long gas removal timescales.
Eventually, many of the most massive stars are expelled from the bound cluster.
Despite the high initial stellar density and the extensive dynamical evolution
of the system, we find that the stellar multiplicity is almost constant during
the 10 Myr of evolution. This is because the primordial multiple systems are
formed in a clustered environment and, thus, by their nature are already
resistant to further evolution. The majority of multiple system evolution is
confined to the decay of high-order systems and the formation of a significant
population of very wide (10^4-10^5 AU) multiple systems in the expanding halo.
This formation mechanism for wide binaries potentially solves the problem of
how most stars apparently form in clusters and yet a substantial population of
wide binaries exist in the field. Many of these wide binaries and the binaries
produced by the decay of high-order multiple systems have unequal mass
components, potentially solving the problem that hydrodynamical simulations of
star formation are found to under-produce unequal-mass solar-type binaries.

discovered by the SDSS-II Supernova Survey. From a set of 391 light curves
k-corrected to the rest frame B and V bands, we find a smaller dispersion in
the rising portion of the light curve compared to the decline. This is in
qualitative agreement with computer models which predict that variations in
radioactive nickel yield have less impact on the rise than on the spread of the
decline rates. The differences we find in the rise and fall properties suggest
that a single 'stretch' correction to the light curve phase does not properly
model the range of SN Ia light curve shapes. We select a subset of 105 light
curves well-observed in both rise and fall portions of the light curves and
develop a '2-stretch' fit algorithm which estimates the rise and fall times
independently. We find the average time from explosion to B-band peak
brightness is 17.38 +/- 0.17 days. Our average rise time is shorter than the
19.5 days found in previous studies; this reflects both the different light
curve template used and the application of the 2-stretch algorithm. We find
that slow declining events tend to have fast rise times, but that the
distribution of rise minus fall time is broad and single-peaked. This
distribution is in contrast to the bimodality in this parameter that was first
suggested by Strovink (2007) from an analysis of a small set of local SNe Ia.
We divide the SDSS-II sample in half based on the rise minus fall value, tr-tf
<= 2 days and tr-tf>2 days, to search for differences in their host galaxy
properties and Hubble residuals; we find no difference in host galaxy
properties or Hubble residuals in our sample.

great interest, not least because it is an important systematic uncertainty
when attempting to detect the dark matter. Here, we draw on a large suite of
high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, to systematically
investigate this process and its dependence on the baryonic physics associated
with galaxy formation. The inclusion of baryons results in significantly more
concentrated density profiles if radiative cooling is efficient and feedback is
weak. The dark matter halo concentration can in that case increase by as much
as 30 (10) per cent on galaxy (cluster) scales. The most significant effects
occur in galaxies at high redshift, where there is a strong anti-correlation
between the baryon fraction in the halo centre and the inner slope of both the
total and the dark matter density profiles. If feedback is weak, isothermal
inner profiles form, in agreement with observations of massive, early-type
galaxies. However, we find that AGN feedback, or extremely efficient feedback
from massive stars, is necessary to match observed stellar fractions in groups
and clusters, as well as to keep the maximum circular velocity similar to the
virial velocity as observed for disk galaxies. These strong feedback models
reduce the baryon fraction in galaxies by a factor of 3 relative to the case
with no feedback. The AGN is even capable of reducing the baryon fraction by a
factor of 2 in the inner region of group and cluster haloes. This in turn
results in inner density profiles which are typically shallower than isothermal
and the halo concentrations tend to be lower than in the absence of baryons.

frequencies of 3-4 mHz from a transient ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX)
X42.3+59 in M82. The QPOs are strong and broad and appear with weak or absent
red noise, and are detected only in Chandra observations when the source is
brighter than 10^40 ergs/s. The QPO behavior is similar to the type A-I QPOs
found in XTE J1550-564, which is a subclass of low frequency QPOs with
properties in between type A and B. Therefore, we identify the QPOs in X42.3+59
as of type A or B, and rule out the possibility of type C. With this
identification, the mass of the black hole in X42.3+59 can be inferred as in
the range of 12,000-43,000 solar masses by scaling the QPO frequency to that of
the type A/B QPOs in stellar mass black holes. Cool disk emission is detected
in one Chandra observation, and the disk inner radius suggests a similar black
hole mass range. Black holes of such a high mass are able to produce an energy
output in a manner similar to X42.3+59 by accreting from the interstellar
medium directly.

carried out in this paper focuses on the execution of functions in the

requirements of execution are only at functional level. The Execution and
integration of results of functions in FPUs are a challenge. The methodology of
executing the functions in the functional processor farm and the integration of
results of functions according to the assigned addresses are investigated here.
The concept of feeding the functions into the processor is promoted rather than
the processor fetching the instructions/functions and executing in this
paradigm. This work is carried out at conceptual levels and it takes a long way
to go into the realization of this model in hardware, possibly only with a

positive RMs (mean RM of +28 rad/m**2) on the eastern side and negative RMs
(mean RM of -14 rad/m**2) on the western side, indicating a magnetic field
which is directed away from us on one side and toward us on the other. We
consider several possible mechanisms for creating the observed RM pattern.
Neither Faraday rotation in foreground interstellar gas nor in a homogeneous
ambient medium swept up by the SNR shell can easily explain the magnitude and
sign of the observed RM pattern. Instead, we propose that the observed RMs are
the imprint of an azimuthal magnetic field in the stellar wind of the
progenitor star. Specifically, we calculate that a swept-up magnetized wind
from a red supergiant can produce RMs of the observed magnitude, while the
azimuthal pattern of the magnetic field at large distances from the star
naturally produces the anti-symmetric RM pattern observed. Expansion into such
a wind can possibly also account for the striking bilateral symmetry of the
SNR's radio and X-ray morphologies.

interference at the transmitter of a multiuser communication system. There are
numerous applications for DPC, including coding for broadcast channels.
Recently, lattice-based coding techniques have provided several designs for
DPC. In lattice-based DPC, there are two codes - a convolutional code that
defines a lattice used for shaping and an error correction code used for
channel coding. Several specific designs have been reported in the recent
literature using convolutional and graph-based codes for capacity-approaching
shaping and coding gains. In most of the reported designs, either the encoder
works on a joint trellis of shaping and channel codes or the decoder requires
iterations between the shaping and channel decoders. This results in high
complexity of implementation. In this work, we present a lattice-based DPC
scheme that provides good shaping and coding gains with moderate complexity at
both the encoder and the decoder. We use a convolutional code for sign-bit
shaping, and a low-density parity check (LDPC) code for channel coding. The
crucial idea is the introduction of a one-codeword delay and careful parsing of
the bits at the transmitter, which enable an LDPC decoder to be run first at
the receiver. This provides gains without the need for iterations between the
shaping and channel decoders. Simulation results confirm that at high rates the
proposed DPC method performs close to capacity with moderate complexity. As an
application of the proposed DPC method, we show a design for superposition
coding that provides rates better than time-sharing over a Gaussian broadcast
channel.

requirements for high-probability phylogeny reconstruction and the related
problem of the estimation of ancestral sequences. In [Daskalakis et al.'09],
building on the work of [Mossel'04], a tight sequence-length requirement was
obtained for the CFN model. In particular the required sequence length for
high-probability reconstruction was shown to undergo a sharp transition (from
$O(\log n)$ to $\hbox{poly}(n)$, where $n$ is the number of leaves) at the
""critical"" branch length $\critmlq$ (if it exists) of the ancestral
reconstruction problem.
  Here we consider the GTR model. For this model, recent results of [Roch'09]
show that the tree can be accurately reconstructed with sequences of length
$O(\log(n))$ when the branch lengths are below $\critksq$, known as the
Kesten-Stigum (KS) bound. Although for the CFN model $\critmlq = \critksq$, it
is known that for the more general GTR models one has $\critmlq \geq \critksq$
with a strict inequality in many cases. Here, we show that this phenomenon also
holds for phylogenetic reconstruction by exhibiting a family of symmetric
models $Q$ and a phylogenetic reconstruction algorithm which recovers the tree
from $O(\log n)$-length sequences for some branch lengths in the range
$(\critksq,\critmlq)$. Second we prove that phylogenetic reconstruction under
GTR models requires a polynomial sequence-length for branch lengths above
$\critmlq$.

of reactive power dispatch are focused on the technical side of reactive
support such as minimization of transmission losses. Reactive power cost
compensation to a generator is based on the incurred cost of its reactive power
contribution less the cost of its obligation to support the active power
delivery. In this paper an efficient Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based
reactive power optimization approach is presented. The optimal reactive power
dispatch problem is a nonlinear optimization problem with several constraints.
The objective of the proposed PSO is to minimize the total support cost from
generators and reactive compensators. It is achieved by maintaining the whole
system power loss as minimum thereby reducing cost allocation. The purpose of
reactive power dispatch is to determine the proper amount and location of
reactive support. Reactive Optimal Power Flow (ROPF) formulation is developed

used to embed the watermark image into the original image. The selected blocks
are chosen spirally (beginning form the center of the image) among the blocks
that have log-average luminance higher than or equal the log-average luminance
of the entire image. Each byte of the monochrome watermark is added by updating
a luminance value of a pixel of the image. If the byte of the watermark image
represented white color (255) a value <alpha> is added to the image pixel
luminance value, if it is black (0) the <alpha> is subtracted from the
luminance value. To extract the watermark, the selected blocks are chosen as
the above, if the difference between the luminance value of the watermarked

is supposed to be white, otherwise it supposed to be black. Experimental
results show that the proposed scheme is efficient against changing the

However, they may produce a large number of rules, many of them are

becomes one of determining which rules are the most interesting. Association
rule interestingness measures are used to help select and rank association rule
patterns. Besides support and confidence, there are other interestingness
measures, which include generality reliability, peculiarity, novelty,
surprisingness, utility, and applicability. In this paper, the application of
the interesting measures entropy and variance for association pattern discovery
from spatial gene expression data has been studied. In this study the fast
mining algorithm has been used which produce candidate itemsets and it spends
less time for calculating k-supports of the itemsets with the Boolean matrix
pruned, and it scans the database only once and needs less memory space.

although the XFEL photon beam from a given undulator is meant for a single
user, movable multilayer X-ray mirrors can be used to serve many users
simultaneously. The proposed photon beam distribution system would allow to
switch the FEL beam quickly between many experiments in order to make an
efficient use of the source. Distribution of photons is achieved on the basis
of pulse trains and it is possible to distribute the multicolor photon beam
among many independent beam lines, thereby enabling many users to work in
parallel with different wavelengths.

nm. The baseline design of the European XFEL assumes standard (SASE) FEL mode
for production of radiation i.e. only one photon beam at one fixed wavelength
from each baseline undulator with tunable gap. Recent developments in the field
of FEL physics and technology form a reliable basis for an extensions of the

the output radiation can be decreased well beyond the European XFEL design,
down to 0.05 nm. In the proposed scheme, which is based on the use ""fresh

It is shown that one can generate simultaneously, in the same baseline
undulator with tunable gap, high intensity radiation at 0.05 nm at saturation,
and high intensity radiation around 0.15 nm according to design specifications.
We present a feasibility study and we make exemplifications with the parameters

hardware development will be required to bring these experiments to fruition.
It is proposed to derive both pump and probe pulses from the same electron
bunch, but from different parts of the tunable-gap baseline undulator. This
eliminates the need for synchronization and cancels jitter problems. The method
has the further advantage to make a wide frequency range accessible at high
peak-power and high repetition-rate. An important feature of the proposed
scheme is that the hardware requirement is minimal. Our technique is based in
essence on the ""fresh"" bunch technique. For its implementation it is sufficient
to substitute a single undulator module with short magnetic delay line, i.e. a
weak magnetic chicane, which delays the electron bunch with respect to the SASE
pulse of half of the bunch length in the linear stage of amplification. This
installation does not perturb the baseline mode of operation. We present a

evolutionary picture, submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) would host an AGN, which
would eventually grow a black hole (BH) strong enough to blow off all of the
gas and dust leaving an optically luminous QSO. To probe this evolutionary
sequence we have focussed on the 'missing link' sources, which demonstrate both
strong starburst (SB) and AGN signatures, in order to determine if the SB is
the main power source even in SMGs when we have evidence that an AGN is present
from their IRAC colours. The best way to determine if a dominant AGN is present
is to look for their signatures in the mid-infrared with the Spitzer IRS, since
often even deep X-ray observations miss identifying the presence of AGN in
heavily dust-obscured SMGs. We present the results of our audit of the energy
balance between star-formation and AGN within this special sub-population of
SMGs -- where the BH has grown appreciably to begin heating the dust emission.

constant rotation surfaces, the isorotational contours of the solar convective
zone may be reproduced with great fidelity. Even at this early stage of
development, this helioseismology fit may be used to put a lower bound on the
midlatitude {\em radial} solar entropy gradient, which in good accord with
standard mixing length theory. In this paper, we generalize this solar
calculation to fully convective stars (and potentially planets), retaining the
assumptions of thermal wind balance and effective entropy mixing in
isorotational surfaces. It is found that each isorotation contour is of the
form $R^2 = A+B\Phi(r)$, where $R$ is the radius from the rotation axis,
$\Phi(r)$ is the (assumed spherical) gravitational potential, and $A$ and $B$
are constant along the contour. This result is applied to simple models of
fully convective stars. Both solar-like surface rotation profiles (angular
velocity decreasing toward the poles) as well as ""antisolar"" profiles (angular
velocity increasing toward the poles) are modeled; the latter bear some
suggestive resemblance to numerical simulations. We also perform exploratory
studies of zonal surface flows similar to those seen in Jupiter and Saturn. In

large scale numerical simulations, our findings may also prove useful in
dynamical calculations for which a simple but viable model for the background

successful control system requires some means of measurement. Software metrics
play an important role in the management aspects of the software development
process such as better planning, assessment of improvements, resource

detection of potential problems, productivity evaluation and evaluating
external quality factors such as reusability, maintainability, defect proneness

optimizing the design process and production process for desired levels of

onto the black hole is an important question. It determines the observational
appearance of accretion flows, and is also related with the evolution of black
hole mass and spin. Previous two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of hot
accretion flows find that the flow is convectively unstable because of its
inward increase of entropy. As a result, the mass accretion rate decreases
inward, i.e., only a small fraction of accretion gas can fall onto the black
hole, while the rest circulates in the convective eddies or lost in convective
outflows. Radiation is usually neglected in these simulations. In many cases,
however, radiative cooling is important. In the regime of the luminous hot
accretion flow (LHAF), radiative cooling is even stronger than the viscous
dissipation. In the one dimensional case, this implies that the inward increase
of entropy will become slower or the entropy even decreases inward in the case
of an LHAF. We therefore expect that convective instability becomes weaker or
completely disappears when radiative cooling is important. To examine the
validity of this expectation, in this paper we perform two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations of hot accretion flows with strong radiative
cooling. We find that compared to the case of negligible radiation, convection
only becomes slightly weaker. Even an LHAF is still strongly convectively
unstable, its radial profile of accretion rate correspondingly changes little.
We find the reason is that the entropy still increases inward in the
two-dimensional case.

nanoscale, the preferred mechanism for control of quantum systems is through
application of electric fields, which are strong, can be locally applied, and
rapidly switched. In this work, we provide the theoretical tools for the search
for single molecule magnets suitable for electric control. By group-theoretical
symmetry analysis we find that the spin-electric coupling in triangular
molecules is governed by the modification of the exchange interaction, and is
possible even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. In pentagonal molecules
the spin-electric coupling can exist only in the presence of spin-orbit
interaction. This kind of coupling is allowed for both $s=1/2$ and $s=3/2$
spins at the magnetic centers. Within the Hubbard model, we find a relation
between the spin-electric coupling and the properties of the chemical bonds in
a molecule, suggesting that the best candidates for strong spin-electric
coupling are molecules with nearly degenerate bond orbitals. We also
investigate the possible experimental signatures of spin-electric coupling in
nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance spectroscopy, as well as
in the thermodynamic measurements of magnetization, electric polarization, and
specific heat of the molecules.

secondary calibration timepoints when estimating evolutionary divergence dates.
Such timepoints are divergence time estimates that have been derived from one
molecular data set on the basis of a primary external calibration timepoint,
and which are then used independently on a second data set. Logically, the
primary and secondary calibration points must be mutually consistent, in the
sense that it must be possible to predict each time point from the other.
However, the attempt by Shaul and Graur (2002, Gene 300: 59-61) to assess the
reliability of secondary timepoints is flawed because they presented time
estimates without presenting confidence intervals on those estimates, and so it
was not possible to make any explicit hypothesis tests of divergence times.
Also, they inappropriately excluded some of the data, which leads to a very
biased estimate of one of the divergence times. Here, I present a re-analysis
of the same data set, with more appropriate methodology, and come to the
conclusion that no inconsistencies are involved. However, it is clear from the
analysis that molecular data often have such large confidence intervals that
they are uninformative, and thus cannot be used for reliable hypothesis tests.

with a variable strength of s-wave contact interactions. We analyze the effects
of the anisotropic nature of the dipolar interaction by considering the
magnetization axis to be perpendicular to the trap symmetry axis. In the
absence of a central repulsive barrier, when the trap is purely harmonic, the
effect of reducing the scattering length is a tuning of the geometry of the
system: from a pancake-shaped condensate when it is large, to a cigar-shaped
condensate for small scattering lengths. For a condensate in a toroidal trap,
the interaction in combination with the central repulsive Gaussian barrier
produces an azimuthal dependence of the particle density for a fixed radial
distance. We find that along the magnetization direction the density decreases
as the scattering length is reduced but presents two symmetric density peaks in
the perpendicular axis. For even lower values of the scattering length we
observe that the system undergoes a dipolar-induced symmetry breaking
phenomenon. The whole density becomes concentrated in one of the peaks,
resembling an origin-displaced cigar-shaped condensate. In this context we also
analyze stationary vortex states and their associated velocity field, finding
that this latter also shows a strong azimuthal dependence for small scattering
lengths. The expectation value of the angular momentum along the z direction
provides a qualitative measure of the difference between the velocity in the
different density peaks.

distribution at one side of the galactic disk. These edges coincide with HI
edges. In edge-on galaxies the extraplanar radio emission can extend further
than the HI emission. In the same galaxies asymmetric gradients in the degree
of polarization give additional information on the ram pressure wind direction.
The local total power emission is not sensitive to the effects of ram pressure.
The radio continuum spectrum might flatten in the compressed region only for

set of features. A feature implements a stakeholder's requirement, represents a
design decision and configuration option and, when added to a program, involves
the introduction of new structures, such as classes and methods, and the
refinement of existing ones, such as extending methods. With feature-oriented
decomposition, programs can be generated, solely on the basis of a user's
selection of features, by the composition of the corresponding feature code. A
key challenge of feature-oriented product line engineering is how to guarantee
the correctness of an entire feature-oriented product line, i.e., of all of the
member programs generated from different combinations of features. As the
number of valid feature combinations grows progressively with the number of
features, it is not feasible to check all individual programs. The only
feasible approach is to have a type system check the entire code base of the
feature-oriented product line. We have developed such a type system on the
basis of a formal model of a feature-oriented Java-like language. We
demonstrate that the type system ensures that every valid program of a

At higher temperatures (~360 K), before the transition to three-dimensional

current was applied instead. A reduction of the charge and magnetic peak
intensities occurs when the sample is cooled under a constant electric current.
However, after calibrating the real sample temperature using its own

function and theory of evolution of binary massive black holes interacting with
a massive circumbinary disk in the framework of coevolution of massive black

axisymmetric, geometrically thin, self-regulated, self-gravitating but
non-fragmenting with a fraction of Eddington accretion rate, which is typically
one tenth of Eddington value. The timescale of orbital decay is {then}
estimated as ~10^8yr for equal mass black-hole, being independent of the black
hole mass, semi-major axis, and viscosity parameter but dependent on the
black-hole mass ratio, Eddington ratio, and mass-to-energy conversion

superconductivity in some of the heavy fermion compounds, in Cuprates, in

to Fermi-energy for fermions at the unitarity limit with attractive
interactions is about 0.15, the ratio of the maximum $T_c$ to the typical
phonon frequency in phonon induced s-wave superconductivity is of the same
order; the ratio of p-wave $T_c$ to the renormalized Fermi-energy in liquid
$He^3$, a very strongly correlated Fermi-liquid near its melting pressure, is
only $O(10^{-3})$; in the Cuprates and the heavy-fermions where d-wave
superconductivity occurs in a region governed by a special class of
quantum-critical fluctuations, this ratio rises to $O(10^{-2})$. These
discussions also suggest factors important for obtaining higher $T_c$.

257.55 A feature is detected for the first time in SERTS spectra. The most
useful Fe XI electron density diagnostic is found to be the 308.54/352.67
intensity ratio, which varies by a factor of 8.4 between N_e = 10^8 and 10^11
cm^-3, while showing little temperature sensitivity. However, the 349.04/352.67
ratio potentially provides a superior diagnostic, as it involves lines which
are closer in wavelength, and varies by a factor of 14.7 between N_e = 10^8 and
10^11 cm^-3. Unfortunately, the 349.04 A line is relatively weak, and also
blended with the second-order Fe X 174.52 A feature, unless the first-order
instrument response is enhanced.
