types of linear operators acting diagonally on the monomial basis of R[x],
sending real-rooted polynomials (resp. polynomials with all nonzero roots of
the same sign) to real-rooted polynomials. Motivated by fundamental properties
of amoebae and discriminants discovered by Gelfand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky,
we introduce two new natural classes of polynomials and describe diagonal
operators preserving these new classes. A pleasant circumstance in our
description is that these classes have a simple explicit description, one of
them coinciding with the class of log-concave sequences.

breaking parameters in the MSSM Lagrangian. This leads to the specific
predictions that a 10-100 MeV mass gravitino is the LSP, and the NLSP is
quasi-stable, with a lifetime between a second to an hour. In a wide range of
parameter space, the NLSP turns out to be a stau, though a bino-like lightest
neutralino is also possible. Focusing on F-theory GUTs with a stau NLSP, we
study the discovery potential at the LHC for such scenarios. Models with a
quasi-stable stau predict a striking signature of a heavy charged particle
passing through the detector. As a function of the parameters of minimal
F-theory GUTs, we study how many of such events to expect, and additional
signatures correlated with the presence of quasi-stable staus. We also study
the prospects for staus to become stopped in or near the detector, as well as
potential ways to distinguish such models from minimal gauge mediation models
with similar spectra.

packing circular items and the other for packing rectangular items. These work
by first optimizing object placement order, and then optimizing object
positioning. Based on these heuristics, an ant colony optimization (ACO)
algorithm is described to search first for optimal positioning order, and then
for the optimal layout. We describe the results of numerical experiments, in

depending on a parameter, e.g. the specification of a circuit usually depends
on the number of bits of its input. We define a logic whose formulae, called
""iterated schemata"", allow to express such patterns. Schemata extend
propositional logic with indexed propositions, e.g. P_i, P_i+1, P_1, and with
generalized connectives, e.g. /\i=1..n or i=1..n (called ""iterations"") where n
is an (unbound) integer variable called a ""parameter"". The expressive power of
iterated schemata is strictly greater than propositional logic: it is even out
of the scope of first-order logic. We define a proof procedure, called DPLL*,
that can prove that a schema is satisfiable for at least one value of its
parameter, in the spirit of the DPLL procedure. However the converse problem,
i.e. proving that a schema is unsatisfiable for every value of the parameter,
is undecidable so DPLL* does not terminate in general. Still, we prove that it
terminates for schemata of a syntactic subclass called ""regularly nested"". This
is the first non trivial class for which DPLL* is proved to terminate.
Furthermore the class of regularly nested schemata is the first decidable class
to allow nesting of iterations, i.e. to allow schemata of the form /\i=1..n
(/\j=1..n ...).

ringed state is probed using infrared thermometry and particle image
velocimetry and it is demonstrated to be a consequence of the transient balance
between Coriolis and viscous forces which dominate inertia, each of which are
extracted from the measured velocity field. The breakdown of the ringed state
is quantified in terms of the antiphasing of these force components which
drives a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and we show that the resulting vortex

quasi-two dimensional turbulent vortex flow and thus may have implications in
astrophysics and geophysics wherein rotating convection is ubiquitous. sics.

of its value. Ruin occurs when the total of the value of the risky and riskless
assets and the surrender value of the life annuity reaches zero. We find the
optimal investment strategy and optimal annuity purchase and surrender
strategies in two situations: (i) the value of the risky and riskless assets is
allowed to be negative, with the imputed surrender value of the life annuity
keeping the total positive; or (ii) the value of the risky and riskless assets
is required to be non-negative. In the first case, although the individual has
the flexiblity to buy or sell at any time, we find that the individual will not
buy a life annuity unless she can cover all her consumption via the annuity and
she will never sell her annuity. In the second case, the individual surrenders
just enough annuity income to keep her total assets positive. However, in this
second case, the individual's annuity purchasing strategy depends on the size
of the proportional surrender charge. When the charge is large enough, the
individual will not buy a life annuity unless she can cover all her
consumption, the so-called safe level. When the charge is small enough, the
individual will buy a life annuity at a wealth lower than this safe level.

reveals two distinct tracks -- one with near constant old age of ~12.8 Gyr and
the other branches to younger ages. We find that the latter young track is
dominated by globular clusters associated with the Sagittarius and Canis Major
dwarf galaxies. Despite being overly simplistic, its age-metallicity relation
can be well represented by a simple closed box model with continuous star
formation. The inferred chemical enrichment history is similar to that of the
Large Magellanic Cloud, but is more enriched, at a given age, compared to the
Small Magellanic Cloud. After excluding Sagittarius and Canis Major GCs,
several young track GCs remain. Their horizontal branch morphologies are often
red and hence classified as Young Halo objects, however they do not tend to
reveal extended horizontal branches (a possible signature of an accreted
remnant nucleus). Retrograde orbit GCs (a key signature of accretion) are
commonly found in the young track. We also examine GCs that lie close to the
Fornax-Leo-Sculptor great circle defined by several satellite galaxies. We find
that several GCs are consistent with the young track and we speculate that they
may have been accreted along with their host dwarf galaxy, whose nucleus may

detailed explorations of the neural basis for control of behavior. Here we
describe a new system capable of tracking the position and body orientation of
animals such as flies and birds. The system operates with less than 40 msec
latency and can track multiple animals simultaneously. To achieve these
results, a multi target tracking algorithm was developed based on the Extended
Kalman Filter and the Nearest Neighbor Standard Filter data association
algorithm. In one implementation, an eleven camera system is capable of
tracking three flies simultaneously at 60 frames per second using a gigabit
network of nine standard Intel Pentium 4 and Core 2 Duo computers. This
manuscript presents the rationale and details of the algorithms employed and
shows three implementations of the system. An experiment was performed using
the tracking system to measure the effect of visual contrast on the flight
speed of Drosophila melanogaster. At low contrasts, speed is more variable and
faster on average than at high contrasts. Thus, the system is already a useful
tool to study the neurobiology and behavior of freely flying animals. If
combined with other techniques, such as `virtual reality'-type computer
graphics or genetic manipulation, the tracking system would offer a powerful
new way to investigate the biology of flying animals.

dominates other spin relaxation mechanisms in the limit of small energy

movies of Hinode/SOT. It is shown that the total energy flux at the corona
becomes larger and the transition region height becomes higher in the case when
we use the observed spectrum rather than white/pink noise spectrum as the wave

conditions. For one-dimensional anharmonic oscillators, one can transform the
Schrodinger equation into a Riccati form, i.e., in terms of the logarithmic
derivative of the wave function. A perturbative expansion of the logarithmic
derivative of the wave function can easily be obtained. The Bohr-Sommerfeld
quantization condition can be expressed in terms of a contour integral around
the poles of the logarithmic derivative. Its functional form is B_m(E,g) = n +
1/2, where B is a characteristic function of the anharmonic oscillator of
degree m, E is the resonance energy, and g is the coupling constant. A
recursive scheme can be devised which facilitates the evaluation of
higher-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brioullin (WKB) approximants. The WKB expansion of
the logarithmic derivative of the wave function has a cut in the tunneling
region. The contour integral about the tunneling region yields the instanton
action plus corrections, summarized in a second characteristic function
A_m(E,g). The evaluation of A_m(E,g) by the method of asymptotic matching is
discussed for the case of the cubic oscillator of degree m=3.

NaD, [OI] 6300, H-alpha, [NII] 6583, [SII] 6717, 6731. All of the objects in
our survey show extensive wind-driven filamentation along the minor axis, in
addition to large-scale disk rotation. Our sample can be divided into either
starburst galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGN), although some objects
appear to be a combination of these. The total ionizing photon budget available
to both classes of galaxies is sufficient to ionise all of the wind-blown
filamentation out to large radius. We find however that while AGN
photoionisation always dominates in the wind filaments, this is not the case in
starburst galaxies where shock ionisation dominates. This clearly indicates
that after the onset of star formation, there is a substantial delay (> 10 Myr)
before a starburst wind develops. We show why this behavior is expected by
deriving ``ionisation'' and dynamical timescales for both AGNs and starbursts.
We establish a sequence of events that lead to the onset of a galactic wind.
The clear signature provided by the ionisation timescale is arguably the
strongest evidence yet that the starburst phenomenon is an impulsive event. A
well-defined ionisation timescale is not expected in galaxies with a protracted
history of circumnuclear star formation. Our 3D data provide important
templates for comparisons with high redshift galaxies.[Abridged]

similarity to a disordered metallic ring of circumference $q$ and threaded by
an Aharonov-Bohm flux. Building on that correspondence, we obtain quantitative
results for the time--dependent behavior of the QKR kinetic energy, $E(\tilde

properties). For values of $q$ smaller than the localization length $\xi$, we
obtain scaling $E(\tilde t) \sim \Delta \tilde t^2$, where $\Delta=2\pi/q$ is
the quasi--energy level spacing on the ring. This scaling is indicative of a
long time dynamics that is neither localized nor diffusive. For larger values
$q\gg \xi$, the functions $E(\tilde t)\to \xi^2$ saturates (up to exponentially
small corrections $\sim\exp(-q/\xi)$), thus reflecting essentially localized
behavior.

continuous measurement is formulated via Bohmian mechanics. The solution to
this equation is found through a wave packet approach which establishes a
direct correlation between a classical variable with a quantum variable
describing the dynamics of the center of mass and the width of the wave packet.
The approach presented in this paper gives a comparatively clearer picture than
approaches using restrited path integrals and master equation approaches. This
work shows how the extremely irregular character of classical chaos can be
reconciled with the smooth and wavelike nature of phenomena on the atomic
scale. It is demonstrated that a wave packet under continuous quantum
measurement displays both chaotic and non-chaotic features. The Lyapunov
characteristic exponents for the trajectories of classical particle and the
quantum wave packet center of mass are calculated and their chaoticities are
demonstrated to be about the same. Nonetheless, the width of the wave packet
exhibits a non-chaotic behavior and allows for the possibility to beat the
standard quantum limit by means of transient, contractive states.

Application of wavelet techniques to the time series of disk-integrated

obtained from the MDI clearly indicates that there is enhancement of
high-frequency global waves in the Sun during the flares. This signature of
flares is also visible in the Fourier Power Spectrum of these velocity
oscillations. On the other hand, the analysis of disk-integrated velocity
observations obtained from the GOLF shows only marginal evidence of effects of
flares on high-frequency oscillations.

divided in a statistical error, due to the noise in the input data, and a
systematic error, due to deviations of the default function, used in the MaxEnt
approach, from the exact spectrum. We find that the MaxEnt approach in its
classical formulation can lead to a nonoptimal balance between the two types of
errors, leading to an unnecessary large statistical error. The statistical
error can be reduced by splitting up the data in several batches, performing a
MaxEnt calculation for each batch and averaging. This can outweigh an increase
in the systematic error resulting from this approach. The output from the
MaxEnt result can be used as a default function for a new MaxEnt calculation.
Such iterations often lead to worse results due to an increase in the
statistical error. By splitting up the data in batches, the statistical error
is reduced and and the increase resulting from iterations can be outweighed by
a decrease in the systematic error. Finally we consider a linearized version to
obtain a better understanding of the method.

Collider (LHC) are discussed within the statistical model. Firstly, the system
size and the energy dependence of the model parameters are extracted from
existing data and extrapolated to LHC energy. Particular attention is paid to
demonstrate that the chemical decoupling temperature is independent of the
system size. In the energy regime investigated so far, strangeness production
in pp interactions is strongly influenced by the canonical suppression effects.
At LHC energies, this influence might be reduced. Particle ratios with
particular sensitivity to canonical effects are indicated.
  Secondly, the relation between the strangeness production and the
charged-particle multiplicity in pp interactions is investigated. In this
context the multiplicity dependence studied at Tevatron is of particular
interest. There, the trend in relative strangeness production known from
centrality dependent heavy-ion collisions is not seen in multiplicity selected
pp interactions. However, the conclusion from the Tevatron measurements is
based on rather limited data samples with low statistics and number of
observables. We argue, that there is an absolute need at LHC to measure
strangeness production in events with different multiplicities to possibly
disentangle relations and differences between particle production in pp and
heavy-ion collisions.

physical mechanisms contributing to the MZ relation by adopting analytical
solutions of chemical evolution models including infall and outflow. We explore
the hypotheses of a variable galactic wind rate, infall rate and yield per
stellar generation (i.e. a variation in the IMF), as possible causes for the MZ
relation. By means of analytical models we compute the expected O abundance for
galaxies of a given total baryonic mass and gas mass.The stellar mass is
derived observationally and the gas mass is derived by inverting the Kennicutt
law of star formation, once the star formation rate is known. Then we test how
the parameters describing the outflow, infall and IMF should vary to reproduce
the MZ relation, and we exclude the cases where such a variation leads to
unrealistic situations. We find that a galactic wind rate increasing with
decreasing galactic mass or a variable IMF are both viable solutions for the MZ
relation. A variable infall rate instead is not acceptable. It is difficult to
disentangle among the outflow and IMF solutions only by considering the MZ
relation, and other observational constraints should be taken into account to
select a specific solution. For example, a variable efficiency of star
formation increasing with galactic mass can also reproduce the MZ relation and
explain the downsizing in star formation suggested for ellipticals. The best
solution could be a variable efficiency of star formation coupled with galactic
winds, which are indeed observed in low mass galaxies.

binary system, SDSS J1416+13AB, found by cross-matching the UKIDSS Large Area
Survey Data Release 5 against the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. The
d/sdL7 is blue in J-H and H-K and has other features suggestive of
low-metallicity and/or high gravity. The T7.5p displays spectral peculiarity
seen before in earlier type dwarfs discovered in UKIDSS LAS DR4, and referred
to as CH4-J-early peculiarity. We suggest that CH4-J-early peculiarity arises
from low-metallicity and/or high-gravity, and speculate as to its use for
classifying T dwarfs. UKIDSS and follow-up UKIRT/WFCAM photometry shows the T
dwarf to have the bluest near infrared colours yet seen for such an object with
H-K = -1.31+/-0.17. Warm Spitzer IRAC photometry shows the T dwarf to have
extremely red H-[4.5] = 4.86+/-0.04, which is the reddest yet seen for a
substellar object. The lack of parallax measurement for the pair limits our
ability to estimate parameters for the system. However, applying a conservative
distance estimate of 5-15 pc suggests a projected separation in range 45-135
AU. By comparing H-K:H-[4.5] colours of the T dwarf to spectral models we
estimate that Teff = 500 K and [M/H]~-0.30, with log g ~ 5.0. This suggests a
mass of ~30 MJupiter for the T dwarf and an age of ~10 Gyr for the system. The
primary would then be a 75MJupiter object with log g ~ 5.5 and a relatively
dust-free Teff ~ 1500K atmosphere. Given the unusual properties of the system
we caution that these estimates are uncertain. We eagerly await parallax
measurements and high-resolution imaging which will constrain the parameters
further.

between the internal and motional degrees of freedom so that the internal state
of a molecule can be mapped onto the motion of that molecule in an external
trapping potential. By sympathetically cooling the translational motion back
into its ground state the mapping process can be employed as part of a cooling
scheme for molecular rotational levels. This step is achieved through a common
mode involving a laser-cooled atom trapped alongside the molecule. For the
coherent mapping we will focus on adiabatic passage techniques which may be
expected to provide robust and efficient population transfers. By applying
far-detuned chirped adiabatic rapid passage pulses we are able to achieve an
efficiency of better than 98% for realistic parameters and including
spontaneous emission. Even though our main focus is on cooling molecular
states, the analysis of the different adiabatic methods has general features
which can be applied to atomic systems.

violent phase of evolution which caused them to become hydrogen-deficient
giants, possibly R CrB stars. Using the latest generation of models for
spherically expanding stellar atmospheres, we set out to measure mass-loss
rates for a representative fraction of these stars. We have used
high-resolution ultraviolet and optical spectra, and ultraviolet, optical and
near-infrared photometry from a variety of archives. Overall atmospheric
parameters have mostly been taken from previous analyses and checked for
consistency. Mass-loss rates were measured by fitting the P-Cygni and
asymmetric profiles of C, N and Si ultraviolet resonance lines and lie in the
range 10^{-10} - 10^{-7} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}. These rates follow a Castor-type
(\dot{M} \propto L^{1.5}) relation marking a lower limit for the mass loss from
hot stars of all kinds. The mass-loss rates of the studied stars also show a
strong correlation with their proximity to the Eddington limit. There is no
firm evidence for variability in the stellar wind, although photospheric
pulsations have been reported in many cases.

characterised by a series of recurrent bursts. We describe the results of the
timing analysis performed on the MECS (1.6--10 keV) and PDS (15--100 keV) data.
The X-ray count rate from \grss showed an increasing trend with different
characteristics in the various energy bands. Fourier and wavelet analyses
detect a variation in the recurrence time of the bursts, from 45--50 s to about
75 s, which appear well correlated with the count rate. From the power
distribution of peaks in Fourier periodograms and wavelet spectra, we
distinguished between the {\it regular} and {\it irregular} variability modes
of the $\rho$ class, which are related to variations in the count rate in the
3--10 keV range. We identified two components in the burst structure: the slow
leading trail, and the pulse, superimposed on a rather stable level. We found
that the change in the recurrence time of the regular mode is caused by the
slow leading trails, while the duration of the pulse phase remains far more
stable. The evolution in the mean count rates shows that the time behaviour of
both the leading trail and the baseline level are very similar to those
observed in the 1.6--3 and 15--100 keV ranges, while that of the pulse follows
the peak number. These differences in the time behaviour and count rates at
different energies indicate that the process responsible for the pulses must
produce the strongest emission between 3 and 10 keV, while that associated with
both the leading trail and the baseline dominates at lower and higher energies

for a scalar particle, two pairs of linearly independent solutions are
specified explicitly: running and standing waves. A known algorithm for
calculation of the reflection coefficient $R_{\epsilon j}$ on the background of
the de Sitter space-time model is analyzed. It is shown that the determination
of R_{\epsilon j} requires an additional constrain on quantum numbers \epsilon
\rho / \hbar c >> j, where \rho is a curvature radius. When taken into account
of this condition, the R_{\epsilon j} vanishes identically. It is claimed that
the calculation of the reflection coefficient R_{\epsilon j} is not required at
all because there is no barrier in an effective potential curve on the

particles with higher spins, it is demonstrated explicitly with the help of
exact solutions for electromagnetic and Dirac fields.

3-dimensional topology underlying the Helmholtz cuts method, which occurs in a
wide theoretic and applied literature about Electromagnetism, Fluid dynamics
and Elasticity on domains of the ordinary space. We consider two classes of
bounded domains that satisfy mild boundary conditions and that become ""simple""
after a finite number of disjoint cuts along properly embedded surfaces. For
the first class (Helmholtz), ""simple"" means that every curl-free smooth vector
field admits a potential. For the second (weakly-Helmholtz), we only require
that a potential exists for the restriction of every curl-free smooth vector
field defined on the whole initial domain. By means of classical and rather
elementary facts of 3-dimensional geometric and algebraic topology, we give an
exhaustive description of Helmholtz domains, realizing that their topology is
forced to be quite elementary (in particular, Helmholtz domains with connected
boundary are just possibly knotted handlebodies, and the complement of any
non-trivial link is not Helmholtz). The discussion about weakly-Helmholtz
domains is a bit more advanced, and their classification appears to be a quite
difficult issue. Nevertheless, we provide several interesting characterizations
of them and, in particular, we point out that the class of links with
weakly-Helmholtz complements eventually coincides with the class of the
so-called homology boundary links, that have been widely studied in Knot

standard version, a flooding operation consists of the player choosing a colour
k, which then changes the colour of all the tiles in the monochromatic region
connected to the top left tile to k. After this operation has been performed,
neighbouring regions which are already of the chosen colour k will then also
become connected, thereby extending the monochromatic region of the board. We
show that finding the minimum number of flooding operations is NP-hard for c>=3

al., has been proposed for approximating Gaussian relay networks. This model,
known as the ADT network model, takes into account the broadcast nature of
wireless medium and interference. Avestimehr et al. showed that the Min-cut
Max-flow theorem holds in the ADT network.
  In this paper, we show that the ADT network model can be described within the
algebraic network coding framework introduced by Koetter and Medard. We prove
that the ADT network problem can be captured by a single matrix, called the
""system matrix"". We show that the min-cut of an ADT network is the rank of the
system matrix; thus, eliminating the need to optimize over exponential number
of cuts between two nodes to compute the min-cut of an ADT network.
  We extend the capacity characterization for ADT networks to a more general
set of connections. Our algebraic approach not only provides the Min-cut
Max-flow theorem for a single unicast/multicast connection, but also extends to
non-multicast connections such as multiple multicast, disjoint multicast, and
two-level multicast. We also provide sufficiency conditions for achievability
in ADT networks for any general connection set. In addition, we show that the
random linear network coding, a randomized distributed algorithm for network
code construction, achieves capacity for the connections listed above.
  Finally, we extend the ADT networks to those with random erasures and cycles
(thus, allowing bi-directional links). Note that ADT network was proposed for
approximating the wireless networks; however, ADT network is acyclic.
Furthermore, ADT network does not model the stochastic nature of the wireless
links. With our algebraic framework, we incorporate both cycles as well as
random failures into ADT network model.

Intersection types provide finitary type polymorphism and can characterise
normalisable lambda-terms through the property that a term is normalisable if
and only if it is typeable. To be closer to computations and to simplify the
formalisation of the atomic operations involved in beta-contractions, several
calculi of explicit substitution were developed mostly with de Bruijn indices.
Versions of explicit substitutions calculi without types and with simple type
systems are well investigated in contrast to versions with more elaborate type
systems such as intersection types. In previous work, we introduced a de Bruijn
version of the lambda-calculus with an intersection type system and proved that
it preserves subject reduction, a basic property of type systems. In this paper
a version with de Bruijn indices of an intersection type system originally
introduced to characterise principal typings for beta-normal forms is
presented. We present the characterisation in this new system and the
corresponding versions for the type inference and the reconstruction of normal
forms from principal typings algorithms. We briefly discuss the failure of the
subject reduction property and some possible solutions for it.

pulsating stars. Many of these modulations are nearly periodic. In RR Lyrae
stars the phenomenon in known as the Blazhko Effect. Because of the observed
similarities, we propose to extend the definition to other groups. We
illustrate the Blazhko Effect with examples from Cepheids, RR Lyrae stars,
White Dwarfs, sdB stars and delta Scuti variables. For delta Scuti stars the
present results indicate the presence of at least two effects: beating of
independent modes with close frequencies and stellar cycles. For period and
amplitude changes with timescales less than one year, the beating hypothesis
explains the observed modulations very well. This has been shown by the
correctly correlated relationship between amplitude and phase changes as well
as the repetitions of these cycles. However, the observed period variations
with longer timescales cannot be due to simple beating between two close
frequencies. For the star AI CVn (= 4 CVn), we can derive accurate annual
frequency values for a number of radial and nonradial modes from 1974 to 2009.
For prograde and retrograde modes, the frequency variations are of similar
size, but with opposite signs. The radial mode shows no (or little) changes.
Fur- thermore, all frequency variations show a reversal around 1990. These
results are consistent with long-term cycles affecting individual modes
differently with some common systematic behavior. The observed change in the
size of rotational splitting is interpreted as a change in the differential
rotation during the stellar cycle.

gravitational interactions between matter and twin matter (TM). Twin matter is
hypothetical matter that might couple directly only to the second metric of the
theory. Considerations of cosmology in the BIMOND framework suggest that such
TM might exist and copy matter in its attributes. Here I investigate the
indirect interactions that BIMOND theories predict between nonrelativistic
masses of matter and TM. The most salient result is that in the deep-MOND
regime of the matter-TM-symmetric theories, TM behaves as if it has a negative
gravitational mass. To wit, interaction within each sector is attractive MOND
gravity, but between matter and TM it is repulsive MOND gravity. In the
high-acceleration regime, the interaction depends on a parameter, beta. For the
favored value beta=1, matter and TM do not interact in this regime; for beta<1
they attract; and for beta>1 they repel each other. Such interactions may have
substantial ramifications for all aspects of structure formation, such as
matter distribution, peculiar velocities, and effects on the CMB. The repulsive
interactions probably lead to segregation of matter and TM structures, leading,
in turn, to intermeshing of the respective cosmic webs, with high-density nodes
of one sector residing in the voids of the other (possibly conducing to
efficient evacuation of the voids). Weak lensing by TM seems the best way to
constrain its attributes. In the MOND regime a TM body acts on matter photons
as a diverging lens. Strong lensing occurs in the high acceleration regime, and
thus depends on the value of beta. For beta=1 no strong lensing effects of TM
are expected. I also discuss briefly asymmetric theories (abridged).

threshold is below the opacity limit. In that case, the density can exceed the
threshold in strong shocks that do not necessarily lead to local collapse.
Additional checks for bound state, gravitational potential minimum, Jeans

They are
invariant under pure metric rescalings (i.e. the matter fields are inert under
those). This symmetry forbids the presence of a cosmological constant. Those
theories are not invariant under the full set of diffeomorphisms, but only with
respect to those locally characterized by the fact that their generator is
transverse $\pd_\a \xi^\a=0$.

customers in making privacy decisions when confronted with RFID tags. The
approach we take to increase customer privacy is a radical departure from the
mainstream research efforts that focus on implementing privacy enhancing
technologies on the RFID tags themselves. Instead the Privacy Coach functions
as a mediator between customer privacy preferences and corporate privacy
policies, trying to find a match between the two, and informing the user of the
outcome. In this paper we report on the architecture of the Privacy Coach, and
show how it enables users to make informed privacy decisions in a user-friendly
manner. We also spend considerable time to discuss lessons learnt and to
describe future plans to further improve on the Privacy Coach concept.

with constrained control amplitude. We consider a commonly encountered case in
which the transverse relaxation rate is much larger than the longitudinal one
so that the latter can be neglected. Using the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle,
we derive optimal feedback laws which are characterized by the number of
switches, depending on the control bound and the coordinates of the desired
final state.

similarities between qQ and qg-scattering. In particular, we discuss how at
tree-level, all non-suppressed helicity-amplitudes for these processes consist
of a pure t-channel pole. This structure is used in the construction of

first proved by Timofte. It says that a symmetric real polynomial $F$ of degree
$d$ in $n$ variables is positive on $\R^n$ (on $\R^{n}_{\geq 0}$) if and only
if it is so on the subset of points with at most $\max\{\lfloor d/2\rfloor,2\}$
distinct components. We deduce Timofte's original statement as a corollary of a
slightly more general statement on symmetric optimization problems. The idea we
are using to prove this statement is to relate it to a linear optimization
problem in the orbit space. The fact that for the case of the symmetric group
$S_n$ this can be viewed as a question on normalized univariate real
polynomials with only real roots allows us to conclude the theorems in a very
elementary way. We hope that the methods presented here will make it possible
to derive similar statements also in the case of other groups.

Pulsars (AXPs) in order to constrain the distance and the optical extinction of
each source. We obtain surface brightness distributions from EPIC-pn data
obtained with XMM-Newton, compare the profiles of different sources, and fit
them with a model based on the standard theory of X-ray scattering by dust
grains, both for a uniform distribution of dust along the line of sight, and
for dust distributions constrained by previous measurements. Somewhat
surprisingly, we find that for all three sources, the uniform distribution
reproduces the observed surface brightness as well as or better than the
distributions that are informed by previous constraints. Nevertheless, the
inferred total dust columns are robust, and serve to confirm that previous
measurements based on interstellar edges in high-resolution X-ray spectra and
on modelling of broad-band X-ray spectra were reliable. Specifically, we find
Av ~= 4, 6, and 8 mag for 4U 0142+61, 1E 1048.1-5937, and 1RXS
J170849.0-400910, respectively. For 1E 1048.1-5937, this is well in excess of
the extinction expected towards a HI bubble along the line of sight, thus
casting further doubt on the suggested association with the source.
