anisotropic inflation driven by a scalar and a vector field. The action for the
vector is U(1) invariant, and the model is free of ghost instabilities. A
suitable coupling of the scalar to the kinetic term of the vector allows for a
slow roll evolution of the vector vev, and hence for a prolonged anisotropic
expansion; this provides a counter example to the cosmic no hair conjecture. We
compute the nonvanishing two point correlation functions between physical modes
of the system, and express them in terms of power spectra with angular
dependence. The anisotropy parameter g_* for the scalar-scalar spectrum
(defined as in the Ackerman et al '07 parametrization) turns out to be negative
in the simplest realization of the model, which, therefore, cannot account for
the angular dependence emerged in some analyses of the WMAP data. A g_* of
order -0.1 is achieved when the energy of the vector is about 6-7 orders of
magnitude smaller than that of the scalar during inflation. For such values of
the parameters, the scalar-tensor correlation (which is in principle a
distinctive signature of anisotropic spaces) is smaller than the tensor-tensor
correlation.

  near-critical and normal fluid phases","16 pages",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  Gravity-driven convection of fluid at parameters near its thermodynamic
critical point inside a porous layer heated from below (Rayleigh-Darcy
convection) is studied. The fluid having the temperature slightly above the
critical one is one-component. The hydrodynamic model describing a high
compressible fluid phase at variable physical properties inside a solid matrix
at a uniform porosity is analyzed. A near-critical fluid is assumed to be the
van der Waals gas. In the limit of small variations in the density and
thermodynamic coefficients where the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation is
applicable, the correlation relations for the key criteria of similarity under
the stratification effect are obtained. These relations connect the model
parameters (the Rayleigh-Darcy and Prandtl numbers appearing in the
dimensionless governing equations) with the criteria of similarity (the real
Rayleigh-Darcy and Prandtl numbers characterizing convection actually).
Steady-state Rayleigh-Darcy convection near the stability threshold in
conditions of the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation to be valid is simulated
numerically. A set of solutions is analyzed with the use of the correlation
relations resulting in a universal dependency of the corrected Nusselt number
on the real Rayleigh-Darcy number described by a single curve. Convection of
near-critical fluid is compared with that of normal fluid. The temperature
difference at boundaries corresponding to the convection onset and depending on
the Schwarzschild and Rayleigh criteria is analyzed analytically. As obtained,
near the critical point, the threshold temperature difference at boundaries
becomes independent of solid matrix and is determined solely by the critical
adiabatic temperature gradient of fluid phase.

featureless spectra, due to much larger grains that were ejected from the

speed) that also explain the temporal evolution of the mm-wave flux. Optical
images were obtained on multiple dates spanning 2007 Oct 27 to 2008 Mar 10 at
the Holloway Comet Observatory and 1.5-m telescope at Palomar Observatory. The
orientation of the leading edge of the ejecta shell and the ejecta blob,
relative to the nucleus, do not change as the orientation of the Sun changes;
instead, the configuration was imprinted by the orientation of the initial
explosion. The kinetic energy of the ejecta >1e21 erg is greater than the
gravitational binding energy of the nucleus. We model the explosion as being
due to crystallization and release of volatiles from interior amorphous ice
within a subsurface cavity; once the pressure in the cavity exceeded the
surface strength, the material above the cavity was propelled from the comet.
The size of the cavity and the tensile strength of the upper layer of the
nucleus are constrained by the observed properties of the ejecta; tensile
strengths on >10 m scale must be greater than 10 kPa. The appearance of the
2007 outburst is similar to that witnessed in 1892, but the 1892 explosion was
less energetic by a factor of about 20.

how a pre-existing contracting universe underwent a big crunch/big bang

$-\log\Pi$. The additional momentum variables are chosen at random from the
Boltzmann distribution and the continuous-time Hamiltonian dynamics are then
discretised using the leapfrog scheme. The induced bias is removed via a
Metropolis-Hastings accept/reject rule. In the simplified scenario of

$\mathcal{O}(1)$ acceptance probability as the dimension $d$ of the state space
tends to $\infty$, the leapfrog step-size $h$ should be scaled as $h= l \times

steps to traverse the state space. We also identify analytically the
asymptotically optimal acceptance probability, which turns out to be 0.651 (to
three decimal places). This is the choice which optimally balances the cost of
generating a proposal, which {\em decreases} as $l$ increases, against the cost
related to the average number of proposals required to obtain acceptance, which

recently obtained for finite systems by a novel powerful mathematical method,
the Laplace-Fourier transform. Among them are a constrained version of the
statistical multifragmentation model, the Gas of Bags Model and the Hills and
Dales Model of surface partition. Thus, the Laplace-Fourier transform allows
one to study the nuclear matter equation of state, the equation of state of
hadronic and quark gluon matter and surface partitions on the same footing. A
complete analysis of the isobaric partition singularities of these models is
done for finite systems. The developed formalism allows us, for the first time,
to exactly define the finite volume analogs of gaseous, liquid and mixed phases
of these models from the first principles of statistical mechanics and
demonstrate the pitfalls of earlier works. The found solutions may be used for
building up a new theoretical apparatus to rigorously study phase transitions
in finite systems. The strategic directions of future research opened by these
exact results are also discussed.

of galaxies in cosmic web filaments relative to their host filaments are not
randomly distributed. This would indicate that the action of large scale tidal
torques effected the alignments of galaxies located in cosmic filaments. To
this end, we constructed a catalogue of clean filaments containing edge-on
galaxies. We started by applying the Multiscale Morphology Filter (MMF)
technique to the galaxies in a redshift-distortion corrected version of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR5. From that sample we extracted those 426 filaments
that contained edge-on galaxies (b/a < 0.2). These filaments were then visually
classified relative to a variety of quality criteria. Statistical analysis
using ""feature measures"" indicates that the distribution of orientations of
these edge-on galaxies relative to their parent filament deviate significantly
from what would be expected on the basis of a random distribution of
orientations. The interpretation of this result may not be immediately
apparent, but it is easy to identify a population of 14 objects whose spin axes
are aligned perpendicular to the spine of the parent filament (\cos \theta <
0.2). The candidate objects are found in relatively less dense filaments. This
might be expected since galaxies in such locations suffer less interaction with
surrounding galaxies, and consequently better preserve their tidally induced
orientations relative to the parent filament. The technique of searching for
fossil evidence of alignment yields relatively few candidate objects, but it
does not suffer from the dilution effects inherent in correlation analysis of
large samples.

show the ISO-LWS spectrum between 50-170 micron) and N84 both display strong

these lines to strong shocks and photo-ionized gas, respectively, in a
``champagne flow'' scenario. The nitrogen content of these two HII regions is
very low, definitely N/O<0.04 but possibly as low as N/O<0.01. Overall, the
oxygen lines and dust continuum are weaker in star-forming objects in the SMC
than in the LMC. We attribute this to the lower metallicity of the SMC compared
to that of the LMC. Whilst the dust mass differs in proportion to metallicity,
the oxygen mass differs less; both observations can be reconciled with higher
densities inside star-forming cloud cores in the SMC than in the LMC. The dust
in the YSOs in the SMC is warmer (37-51 K) than in comparable objects in the
LMC (32-44 K). We attribute this to the reduced shielding and reduced cooling
at the low metallicity of the SMC. On the other hand, the efficiency of the
photo-electric effect to heat the gas is found to be indistinguishable to that
measured in the same manner in the LMC, 0.1-0.3%. This may result from higher
cloud-core densities, or smaller grains, in the SMC. The dust associated with
the two RSGs in our SMC sample is cool, and we argue that it is swept-up
interstellar dust, or formed (or grew) within the bow-shock, rather than dust
produced in these metal-poor RSGs themselves. Strong emission from crystalline
water ice is detected in at least one YSO. (abridged)

(GCs) in dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. Our models adopt a cosmologically
motivated scenario in which the dSph is approximated by a static NFW halo with
a triaxial shape. For a large set of orbits and projection angles we examine
the spatial and velocity distribution of stellar debris deposited during the
complete disruption of stellar clusters. Our simulations show that such debris
appears as shells, isolated clumps and elongated over-densities at low surface
brightness (>26 mag/arcsec^2), reminiscent of substructure observed in several
MW dSphs. Such features arise from the triaxiality of the galaxy potential and
do not dissolve in time. Stellar over-densities reported in several MW dSphs
may thus be the telltale evidence of dark matter haloes being triaxial in
shape.
  We explore a number of kinematic signatures that would help to validate (or
falsify) this scenario. The mean angular momentum of the cluster debris
associated with box and resonant orbits, which are absent in spherical
potentials, is null. As a result, we show that the line-of-sight velocity
distribution may exhibit a characteristic ""double-peak"" depending on the
oriention of the viewing angle with respect to the progenitor's orbital plane.
Kinematic surveys of dSphs may help to detect and identify substructures
associated with the disruption of stellar clusters, as well as to address the
shape of the dark matter haloes in which dSphs are embedded.

O-stars. The current consensus is that these winds may be clumped which implies
that all previously derived mass loss rates using density-squared diagnostics
are overestimated by a factor of ~ 2. However, arguments based on FUSE
observations of the P V resonance line doublet suggest that these rates should
be smaller by another order of magnitude, provided that P V is the dominant
phosphorous ion among these stars. Although a large mass loss rate reduction
would have a range of undesirable consequences, it does provide a
straightforward explanation of the unexpected symmetric and un-shifted X-ray
emission line profiles observed in high energy resolution spectra. But
acceptance of such a large reduction then leads to a contradiction with an
important observed X-ray property: the correlation between He-like ion source
radii and their equivalent X-ray continuum optical depth unity radii. Here we
examine the phosphorous ionization balance since the P V fractional abundance,
q(P V), is fundamental to understanding the magnitude of this mass loss
reduction. We find that strong ""XUV"" emission lines in the He II Lyman
continuum can significantly reduce q(P V). Furthermore, owing to the unique
energy distribution of these XUV lines, there is a negligible impact on the S V
fractional abundance (a key component in the FUSE mass loss argument). We
conclude that large reductions in O-star mass loss rates are not required, and
the X-ray optical depth unity relation remains valid.

from optical recombination lines are systematically higher than those derived
from collisionally excited lines. We investigate the hypothesis that the
destruction of solid bodies may produce pockets of cool, high-metallicity gas
that could explain these abundance discrepancies. Under the assumption of
maximally efficient radiative ablation, we derive two fundamental constraints
that the solid bodies must satisfy in order that their evaporation during the
planetary nebula phase should generate a high enough gas phase metallicity. A
local constraint implies that the bodies must be larger than tens of meters,
while a global constraint implies that the total mass of the solid body
reservoir must exceed a few hundredths of a solar mass. This mass greatly
exceeds the mass of any population of comets or large debris particles expected
to be found orbiting evolved low- to intermediate-mass stars. We therefore
conclude that contemporaneous solid body destruction cannot explain the
observed abundance discrepancies in planetary nebulae. However, similar
arguments applied to the sublimation of solid bodies during the preceding
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase do not lead to such a clear-cut conclusion.
In this case, the required reservoir of volatile solids is only one
ten-thousandth of a solar mass, which is comparable to the most massive debris
disks observed around solar-type stars, implying that this mechanism may
contribute to abundance discrepancies in at least some planetary nebulae, so
long as mixing of the high metallicity gas is inefficient.

Theory, vol. 57, no. 10, pp. 6650-6672, 2011","10.1109/TIT.2011.2162179",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimal binary labelings, input distributions, and input alphabets are
analyzed for the so-called bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) capacity,
paying special attention to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. For
8-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and for 0.75 bit/symbol, the folded
binary code results in a higher capacity than the binary reflected gray code
(BRGC) and the natural binary code (NBC). The 1 dB gap between the additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) capacity and the BICM capacity with the BRGC can be
almost completely removed if the input symbol distribution is properly
selected. First-order asymptotics of the BICM capacity for arbitrary input
alphabets and distributions, dimensions, mean, variance, and binary labeling
are developed. These asymptotics are used to define first-order optimal (FOO)
constellations for BICM, i.e. constellations that make BICM achieve the Shannon
limit $-1.59 \tr{dB}$. It is shown that the $\Eb/N_0$ required for reliable
transmission at asymptotically low rates in BICM can be as high as infinity,
that for uniform input distributions and 8-PAM there are only 72 classes of
binary labelings with a different first-order asymptotic behavior, and that
this number is reduced to only 26 for 8-ary phase shift keying (PSK). A general
answer to the question of FOO constellations for BICM is also given: using the
Hadamard transform, it is found that for uniform input distributions, a
constellation for BICM is FOO if and only if it is a linear projection of a
hypercube. A constellation based on PAM or quadrature amplitude modulation
input alphabets is FOO if and only if they are labeled by the NBC; if the
constellation is based on PSK input alphabets instead, it can never be FOO if
the input alphabet has more than four points, regardless of the labeling.

where the Standard Model is augmented by a new confining gauge interaction and
new light fermions that carry vectorlike charges under both the Standard Model

framework gives rise to a wide range of exotic collider signatures such as the
production of a vector resonance that decays to a pair of collider-stable
charged massive particles (a ""di-CHAMP"" resonance), to a pair of
collider-stable massive colored particles (a ""di-R-hadron resonance), to
multiple photons, $W$s and $Z$s via two intermediate scalars, and/or to
multi-jet final states. To study these signals at the LHC, we set up two
benchmark models: one for the di-CHAMP and multi-photon signals, and the other
for the di-R-hadron and multijet signals. For the di-CHAMP/multi-photon model,
Standard Model backgrounds are negligible, and we show that a full
reconstruction of the spectrum is possible, providing powerful evidence for
vectorlike confinement. For the di-R-hadron/multijet model, we point out that
in addition to the di-R-hadron signal, the rate of the production of four
R-hadrons can also be sizable at the LHC. This, together with the multi-jet
signals studied in earlier work, makes it possible to single out vectorlike
confinement as the underlying dynamics.

no evidence of any instability in five or seven dimensions, but in nine

exponentially in time. The onset of instability is associated with the
appearance of time-independent perturbations which generically break all but
one of the rotational symmetries. This is interpreted as evidence for the
existence of a new 70-parameter family of black hole solutions with only a
single rotational symmetry. We also present results for the Gregory-Laflamme

constructed by combining the deep multi-wavelength broad-band observations from
the UV to the mid-IR of the NDWFS Bootes field with the X-ray observations of
the XBootes survey and the spectroscopic observations of the same field by
AGES. Our sample is primarily composed of IRAC-selected AGNs, targeted using
modifications of the Stern et al.(2005) criteria, complemented by MIPS 24
microns and X-ray selected AGNs to alleviate the biases of IRAC mid-IR
selection against z~4.5 quasars and AGNs faint with respect to their hosts.
This sample provides an accurate link between low and high redshift AGN
luminosity functions and does not suffer from the usual incompleteness of
optical samples at z~3. We find that the space density of the brightest quasars
strongly decreases from z=3 to z=0, while the space density of faint quasars is
at least flat, and possibly increasing, over the same redshift range. At z>3 we
observe a decrease in the space density of quasars of all brightnesses. We
model the luminosity function by a double power-law and find that its evolution
cannot be described by either pure luminosity or pure density evolution, but
must be a combination of both. Our best-fit model has bright and faint
power-law indices consistent with the low redshift measurements based on the
2QZ and 2SLAQ surveys and it generally agrees with the number of bright quasars
predicted by other LFs at all redshifts. If we construct the QSO luminosity
function using only the IRAC-selected AGNs, we find that the biases inherent to
this selection method significantly modify the behavior of phi*(z) only for z<1
and have no significant impact upon the characteristic magnitude M*_J(z).

Gamma-Ray Space Telescope taken during the first 11 months of survey mode
operations. The Fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particle
dark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pair
annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Local Group dwarf
spheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the cold
dark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches for
dark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matter
dominated environments. No significant gamma-ray emission was detected above
100 MeV from the candidate dwarf galaxies. We determine upper limits to the
gamma-ray flux assuming both power-law spectra and representative spectra from
WIMP annihilation. The resulting integral flux above 100 MeV is constrained to
be at a level below around 10^-9 photons cm^-2 s^-1. Using recent stellar
kinematic data, the gamma-ray flux limits are combined with improved
determinations of the dark matter density profile in 8 of the 14 candidate
dwarfs to place limits on the pair annihilation cross-section of WIMPs in
several widely studied extensions of the standard model. With the present data,
we are able to rule out large parts of the parameter space where the thermal
relic density is below the observed cosmological dark matter density and WIMPs
(neutralinos here) are dominantly produced non-thermally, e.g. in models where
supersymmetry breaking occurs via anomaly mediation. The gamma-ray limits
presented here also constrain some WIMP models proposed to explain the Fermi
and PAMELA e^+e^- data, including low-mass wino-like neutralinos and models
with TeV masses pair-annihilating into muon-antimuon pairs. (Abridged)

is, the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightest
halo galaxy (BHG), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter
potential well. This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption
made in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper we test the
validity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group we compute two statistics, ${\cal R}$
and ${\cal S}$, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and
projected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group
members. By comparing the cumulative distributions of $|{\cal R}|$ and $|{\cal
S}|$ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the
null-hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a
non-zero fraction $f_{\rm BNC}(M)$ of all haloes of mass $M$ the BHG is not the
central galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy. In particular, we find that
$f_{\rm BNC}$ increases from $\sim 0.25$ in low mass haloes ($10^{12} h^{-1}
{\rm M_{\odot}} \leq M \lsim 2 \times 10^{13} h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$) to $\sim
0.4$ in massive haloes ($M \gsim 5 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} {\rm M_{\odot}}$). We
show that these values of $f_{\rm BNC}$ are uncomfortably high compared to
predictions from halo occupation statistics and from semi-analytical models of
galaxy formation. We end by discussing various implications of a non-zero
$f_{\rm BNC}(M)$, with an emphasis on the halo masses inferred from satellite
kinematics.

category in all four cases. In contrast to the approach of Dwyer, Hirschhorn,

test the standard cosmological model and its extensions. By combining WMAP with
the latest distance measurements from BAO and H0 measurement, we determine the
parameters of the simplest LCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial
power spectrum is n_s=0.968+-0.012, a measurement that excludes the
scale-invariant spectrum by 99.5%CL. The other parameters are also improved
from the 5-year results. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total
mass of neutrinos, sum(m_nu)<0.58eV, and the effective number of neutrino
species, N_eff=4.34+0.86-0.88. We detect the effect of primordial helium on the
temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis.
We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial
polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an
important test of physical processes at z=1090 and the dominance of adiabatic
scalar fluctuations. With the 7-year TB power spectrum, the limit on a rotation
of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has
improved to Delta(alpha)=-1.1+-1.4(stat)+-1.5(syst) degrees. We report
significant detections of the SZ effect at the locations of known clusters of
galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the
X-ray data. However, it is a factor of 0.5 to 0.7 times the predictions from
""universal profile"" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical
simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant
difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed
and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This
lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically-expected SZ
power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope collaboration.

74 and KOI 81, in which the relative depths of the primary and secondary
eclipses showed that the more compact, less luminous object was hotter than its
stellar host. That result became particularly intriguing because a substellar
mass had been derived for the secondary in KOI 74, which would make the high
temperature challenging to explain; in KOI 81, the mass range for the companion
was also reported to be consistent with a substellar object. We re-analyze the
Kepler data and demonstrate that both companions are likely to be white dwarfs.
We also find that the photometric data for KOI 74 show a modulation in
brightness as the more luminous star orbits, due to Doppler boosting. The
magnitude of the effect is sufficiently large that we can use it to infer a
radial velocity amplitude accurate to 1 km/s. As far as we are aware, this is
the first time a radial-velocity curve has been measured photometrically.
Combining our velocity amplitude with the inclination and primary mass derived
from the eclipses and primary spectral type, we infer a secondary mass of
0.22+/-0.03 Msun. We use our estimates to consider the likely evolutionary
paths and mass-transfer episodes of these binary systems.

radio pulsars fall in regions of parameter space where the e+e- contribution is
predicted to be typically much smaller than from those regions where Fermi-LAT
pulsars exist. However, comparing the Fermi gamma-ray flux sensitivity to the
regions of pulsar parameter space where a significant e+e- contribution is
predicted, we find that a few known radio pulsars that have not yet been

the order of one mega-year.

properties of these simple disks are at the end of a continuum that extends
smoothly from bulge-dominated disk galaxies to the pure disks. On average,
simple disks are low-mass galaxies with low surface brightnesses, blue colors,
and slow rotational velocities. Widely-accepted cosmological models of galaxy
formation and evolution were challenged by a relatively large observed fraction
of pure disk galaxies, and only very recent models can explain the existence of
simple disk galaxies. This makes simple disks an optimal galaxy type for the
study of galaxy formation in a hierarchical Universe. They enable us to analyze
the environmental and internal influence on galaxy evolution, to study the
stability of the disks, and to explain the nature and distribution of dark
matter in galaxies. This review summarizes the current status of edge-on simple

analyzed for the so-called bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) capacity,
paying special attention to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. For
8-ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and for 0.75 bit/symbol, the folded
binary code results in a higher capacity than the binary reflected gray code
(BRGC) and the natural binary code (NBC). The 1 dB gap between the additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) capacity and the BICM capacity with the BRGC can be
almost completely removed if the input symbol distribution is properly
selected. First-order asymptotics of the BICM capacity for arbitrary input
alphabets and distributions, dimensions, mean, variance, and binary labeling
are developed. These asymptotics are used to define first-order optimal (FOO)
constellations for BICM, i.e. constellations that make BICM achieve the Shannon
limit $-1.59 \tr{dB}$. It is shown that the $\Eb/N_0$ required for reliable
transmission at asymptotically low rates in BICM can be as high as infinity,
that for uniform input distributions and 8-PAM there are only 72 classes of
binary labelings with a different first-order asymptotic behavior, and that
this number is reduced to only 26 for 8-ary phase shift keying (PSK). A general
answer to the question of FOO constellations for BICM is also given: using the
Hadamard transform, it is found that for uniform input distributions, a
constellation for BICM is FOO if and only if it is a linear projection of a
hypercube. A constellation based on PAM or quadrature amplitude modulation
input alphabets is FOO if and only if they are labeled by the NBC; if the
constellation is based on PSK input alphabets instead, it can never be FOO if
the input alphabet has more than four points, regardless of the labeling.

investigate how geometric projection may affect the derived Larson
relationships. We find that large scale structures in the column density map
have similar masses and sizes to those in the 3D simulation (PPP). Smaller
scale clumps in the column density map are measured to be more massive than the
PPP clumps, due to the projection of all emitting gas along lines of sight.
Further, due to projection effects, structures in a synthetic spectral
observation (PPV) may not necessarily correlate with physical structures in the
simulation. In considering the turbulent velocities only, the linewidth-size
relationship in the PPV cube is appreciably different from that measured from
the simulation. Including thermal pressure in the simulated linewidths imposes
a minimum linewidth, which results in a better agreement in the slopes of the
linewidth-size relationships, though there are still discrepancies in the
offsets, as well as considerable scatter. Employing commonly used assumptions
in a virial analysis, we find similarities in the computed virial parameters of
the structures in the PPV and PPP cubes. However, due to the discrepancies in
the linewidth- and mass- size relationships in the PPP and PPV cubes, we
caution that applying a virial analysis to observed clouds may be misleading
due to geometric projection effects. We speculate that consideration of
physical processes beyond kinetic and gravitational pressure would be required
for accurately assessing whether complex clouds, such as those with highly
filamentary structure, are bound.

foreground masks, and updates to point source catalogs with 62 newly detected
sources. Also new are tests of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) foreground
fitting procedure against systematics in the time-stream data, and tests
against the observed beam asymmetry.
  Within a few degrees of the Galactic plane, WMAP total intensity data show a
rapidly steepening spectrum from 20-40 GHz, which may be due to emission from
spinning dust grains, steepening synchrotron, or other effects. Comparisons are
made to a 1-degree 408 MHz map (Haslam et al.) and the 11-degree ARCADE 2 data
(Singal et al.). We find that spinning dust or steepening synchrotron models
fit the combination of WMAP and 408 MHz data equally well. ARCADE data appear
inconsistent with the steepening synchrotron model, and consistent with the
spinning dust model, though some discrepancies remain regarding the relative
strength of spinning dust emission. More high-resolution data in the 10-40 GHz
range would shed much light on these issues.

1.2 using close pairs in the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. We find that the
typical environment of mixed and dry merger candidates is denser than that of
wet mergers, mostly due to the color-density relation. While the galaxy
companion rate (Nc) is observed to increase with overdensity, using N-body
simulations we find that the fraction of pairs that will eventually merge
decreases with the local density, predominantly because interlopers are more
common in dense environments. After taking into account the merger probability
of pairs as a function of local density, we find only marginal environment
dependence of the fractional merger rate for wet mergers over the redshift
range we have probed. On the other hand, the fractional dry merger rate
increases rapidly with local density due to the increased population of red
galaxies in dense environments. We also find that the environment distribution
of K+A galaxies is similar to that of wet mergers alone and of wet+mixed
mergers, suggesting a possible connection between K+A galaxies and wet and/or
wet+mixed mergers. We conclude that, as early as z ~ 1, high-density regions
are the preferred environment in which dry mergers occur, and that present-day
red-sequence galaxies in overdense environments have, on average, undergone
1.2+-0.3 dry mergers since this time, accounting for (38+-10)% of their mass
accretion in the last 8 billion years. Our findings suggest that dry mergers
are crucial in the mass-assembly of massive red galaxies in dense environments,
such as Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) in galaxy groups and clusters.

formulation of wave fronts and proved a realization theorem of wave fronts in

essentially same;
  * conformally flat n-manifolds (n>=3) with admissible singular points
  (i.e. admissible GCF-manifolds),
  * frontals as hypersurfaces in the lightcone Q^{n+1}_+,
  * frontals as hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space H^{n+1},
  * sapacelike frontals as hypersurfaces in the de Sitter space S^{n+1}_1.
  Recently, the duality of conformally flat Riemannian manifolds was found by
several geometers. In our setting, this duality can be explained via the
existence of a two-fold map of the congruent classes of admissible
GCF-manifolds into that of frontals in H^{n+1}. It should be remarked that the
dual conformally flat metric may have degenerate points even when the original
conformally flat metric is positive definite. This is the reason why we
consider conformally flat manifolds with singular points. In fact, the duality
is an involution on the set of admissible GCF-manifolds. The case n=2 requires
an exceptional treatment, since any Riemannian 2-manifolds are conformally
flat. At the end of this paper, we also determine the moduli space of isometric
immersions of a given simply connected Riemannian 2-manifold into the lightcone
Q^{3}_+.

our local physical environment. This lies inside the effective domain of
dependence, which (assuming the universe is dominated by dark matter along with
baryonic matter and vacuum-energy-like dark energy) consists of those regions
that have had a significant active physical influence on this environment

determined by the velocity of light c, but by the flow of matter perturbations
along their world lines and associated gravitational effects. We emphasize how
small a region the perturbations which became our Galaxy occupied, relative to

the future of our cosmic domain, we suggest simple dynamical criteria for
determining the present domain of influence and the future matter horizon. The

its reduced action, both of which manifest entanglement. We next apply Jacobi's

formula which is proposed very recently. Since the Unruh temperature is
proportional to the strength of gravitational field, so the modified entropic
force formula is an extension of the Newtonian gravity to weak field. On the
contrary, General Relativity extends Newtonian gravity to strong field case.
Corresponding to Debye temperature, there exists a Debye acceleration g_D. It
is found the Debye acceleration is g_D=10^{-15}N kg^{-1}. This acceleration is
very much smaller than the gravitational acceleration 10^{-4}N kg^{-1} which is
felt by the Neptune and the gravitational acceleration 10^{-10}N kg^{-1} felt
by the Sun. Therefore, the modified entropic force can be very well
approximated by the Newtonian gravity in the solar system and in the Galaxy.
With this Debye acceleration, we find the current cosmic speeding up can be
explained without invoking any kind of dark energy.

rule and they in turn will generate uniqueness results of various technical
strengths regarding space, time, non-relativistic and relativistic quantum

is that the strong force and the Standard Model axiomatizations are not too far
out. Quantum gravity and cosmology are harder problems and maybe new approaches
are needed. However, complete physics axiomatization seems to be an achievable

into existence. We point out that this is due entirely to the supposition of
the nucleation occurring at a single point, which in light of quantum cosmology
seems difficult to support. Even an infinitesimal space-like length at the

  patent filed by the author",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Emergence of various vertical search engines highlights the fact that a
single ranking technology cannot deal with the complexity and scale of search
problems. For example, technology behind video and image search is very
different from general web search. Their ranking functions share few features.
Question answering websites (e.g., Yahoo! Answer) can make use of text matching
and click features developed for general web, but they have unique page
structures and rich user feedback, e.g., thumbs up and thumbs down ratings in
Yahoo! answer, which greatly benefit their own ranking. Even for those features
shared by answer and general web, the correlation between features and
relevance could be very different. Therefore, dedicated functions are needed in
order to better rank documents within individual domains. These dedicated
functions are defined on distinct feature spaces. However, having one search
box for each domain, is neither efficient nor scalable. Rather than typing the
same query two times into both Yahoo! Search and Yahoo! Answer and retrieving
two ranking lists, we would prefer putting it only once but receiving a
comprehensive list of documents from both domains on the subject. This
situation calls for new technology that blends documents from different sources
into a single ranking list. Despite the content richness of the blended list,
it has to be sorted by relevance none the less. We call such technology
blending, which is the main subject of this paper.

We cross-correlated the Millenium Galaxy Catalogue (MGC) and the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy catalogue to provide a sample of MGC objects with high
resolution imaging and both spectroscopic and photometric information available
in the SDSS database. For each galaxy in our sample, we conducted a systematic
morphological analysis by visual inspection of MGC images using their
luminosity contours. The galaxies are classified as either disturbed or
undisturbed objects. We divide the sample into three metallicity regions,
within wich we compare the properties of disturbed and undisturbed objects. We
find that the fraction of galaxies that are strongly disturbed, indicative of
being merger remnants, is higher when lower metallicity objects are considered.
The three bins analysed consist of approximatively 15%, 20%, and 50% disturbed
galaxies (for high, medium, and low metallicity, respectively). Moreover, the
ratio of the disturbed to undisturbed relative distributions of the population
age indicator, Dn(4000), in the low metallicity bin, indicates that the
disturbed objects have substantially younger stellar populations than their
undisturbed counterparts. In addition, we find that an analysis of colour
distributions provides similar results, showing that low metallicity galaxies
with a disturbed morphology are bluer than those that are undisturbed. The
bluer colours and younger populations of the low metallicity, morphologically
disturbed objects suggest that they have experienced a recent merger with an
associated enhanced star formation rate. [abridged]

transition-metal atomic junctions including structural relaxations and
spin-orbit coupling. Upon stretching monatomic chains of W, Ir, and Pt
suspended between two leads, we find the development of strong magnetism and
large values of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) of up to 30 meV
per chain atom. We predict that switches of the easy magnetization axis of the
nanocontacts upon elongation should be observable by ballistic anisotropic
magnetoresistance measurements. Due to the different local symmetry, the
contributions to the MAE of the central chain atoms and chain atoms in the
vicinity of the leads can have opposite signs which reduces the total MAE. We
demonstrate that this effect occurs independent of the chain length or geometry
of the electrodes.

even to long range charge and orbital order. Both systems should be insulating
with a large electrical resistivity, which decreases with increasing
temperature. However, photoemission measurements recently found a polaronic
pseudogap, in a metallic phase of La2-2xSr1+2xMn2O7. This layered manganite is
famous for colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) associated with a phase transition
from this low-temperature metallic phase to a high temperature insulating
phase. Broad charge order peaks due to large polarons observed by neutron and
x-ray scattering in the insulating phase disappear when La2-2xSr1+2xMn2O7
becomes metallic. We report results of inelastic neutron scattering
measurements showing that polarons remain inside the metallic phase as
fluctuations that strongly broaden and soften certain phonons near the wave
vectors where the charge order peaks appeared in the insulating phase. Our
findings imply that polaronic signatures in metals may generally come from a
competing insulating charge-ordered phase. It is highly relevant to cuprate
superconductors with both a pseudogap, and a similar phonon effect associated

obtain this result we compiled existing (mostly single dish) radio data to

a broken power law with a down-break (most conservatively) attributable to a
transition from bremsstrahlung to synchrotron cooling of the in-situ cosmic-ray
electron population. The lower limit on the magnetic field arises through the
consideration that the synchrotron-emitting electrons should not produce too
much gamma-ray emission given existing constraints from the EGRET instrument.

between richness, mass and velocity dispersion. A tight scaling between
richness and mass is found, with an intrinsic scatter of only 0.19 dex in mass
and with a slope one, i.e. clusters which have twice as many galaxies are twice
as massive. When richness is measured without any knowledge of the cluster mass
or linked parameters (such as r200), it can predict mass with an uncertainty of
0.29+/-0.01 dex. As a mass proxy, richness competes favourably with both direct
measurements of mass given by the caustic method, which has typically 0.14 dex
errors (vs 0.29) and X-ray luminosity, which offers a similar 0.30 dex
uncertainty. The similar performances of X-ray luminosity and richness in
predicting cluster masses has been confirmed using cluster masses derived from
velocity dispersion fixed by numerical simulations. These results suggest that
cluster masses can be reliably estimated from simple galaxy counts, at least at
the redshift and masses explored in this work. This has important applications
in the estimation of cosmological parameters from optical cluster surveys,
because in current surveys clusters detected in the optical range outnumber, by
at least one order of magnitude, those detected in X-ray. Our analysis is
robust from astrophysical and statistical perspectives. The data and code used
for the stochastic computation is distributed with the paper. [Abridged]

Moreover, its analysis tools are designed to be used during the flight as well
to produce periodic reports on the status of the instrument. The LIFE suite has
been developed using a multi-layered, cross-platform approach. It implements a
number of analysis modules written in RSI IDL, each accessing the data through
a portable and heavily optimized library of functions written in C and C++. One
of the most important features of LIFE is its ability to run the same data
analysis codes both using ground test data and real flight data as input. The

Thermal tests were carried out as part of the on-ground calibration campaign at
various stages of instrument integration. In this paper we describe the results
and analysis of the tests on the LFI flight model (FM) performed at Thales
Laboratories in Milan (Italy) during 2006, with the purpose of experimentally
sampling the thermal transfer functions and consequently validating the
numerical thermal model describing the dynamic response of the LFI focal plane.
This model has been used extensively to assess the ability of LFI to achieve
its scientific goals: its validation is therefore extremely important in the
context of the Planck mission. Our analysis shows that the measured thermal
properties of the instrument show a thermal damping level better than
predicted, therefore further reducing the expected systematic effect induced in
the LFI maps. We then propose an explanation of the increased damping in terms
of non-ideal thermal contacts.

Tuning is key to achieve the best possible instrument performance and tuning
parameters strongly depend on thermal and electrical conditions. For this
reason tuning has been repeated several times during ground tests and it has
been repeated in flight before starting nominal operations. The paper discusses
the tuning philosophy, the activities and the obtained results, highlighting

GHz spectral range on-board the ESA Planck satellite, launched on May 14th,
2009 to observe the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with unprecedented
precision. In this paper we describe the development and validation of a
software model of the LFI pseudo-correlation receivers which enables to
reproduce and predict all the main system parameters of interest as measured at
each of the 44 LFI detectors. These include system total gain, noise
temperature, band-pass response, non-linear response. The LFI Advanced RF Model
(LARFM) has been constructed by using commercial software tools and data of
each radiometer component as measured at single unit level. The LARFM has been
successfully used to reproduce the LFI behavior observed during the LFI
ground-test campaign. The model is an essential element in the database of LFI
data processing center and will be available for any detailed study of
radiometer behaviour during the survey.

analyze a three-level atomic system in the conditions of electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT), and we investigate the propagation of a gaussian
pulse along a cigar-shaped cloud of both cold and hot atoms in EIT regime. In
particular, we show that it is possible to amplify a slow propagating pulse
without population inversion. We also analyze the regime of anomalous light
propagation showing that it is possible to observe superluminal energy
propagation. In these conditions, it is possible to imprint reversibly
('write') the information carried by the photons onto the atoms, specifically
as a coherent pattern of atomic spins, and later the information stored in the
atomic spins can be transferred back ('read') to the light field, implementing
in this way a quantum memory. Besides, we analyze the propagation of a quantum
field in an EIT medium sustaining dark state polaritons (DSP) in a
quasi-particle picture. Here, the decoherence effects in this quantum memory
for photons, by analyzing the fidelity of the quantum state transfer, and the
emergence of parastatistics in the quasi-particle picture in gain medium are
discussed. Finally, we introduce a polarization quantum memory for photons by
using a tripod atomic configuration in which two ideal EIT windows appear and
the two DSPs, scattering each other, show a solitonic behavior.

three dimensions is investigated based on a Ginzburg-Landau-type effective
Hamiltonian. On the basis of the variational analysis of this model, Onoda et
al recently suggested the possible occurrence of a chiral phase, where the
vector chirality exhibits a long-range order without the long-range order of
the spin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 027206 (2007)]. In the present paper, we
elaborate their analysis by considering the possibility of a first-order
transition which was not taken into account in their analysis. We find that the
first-order transition indeed occurs within the variational approximation,
which significantly reduces the stability range of the chiral phase, while the
chiral phase still persists in a restricted parameter range. Then, we perform
an extensive Monte Carlo simulation focusing on such a parameter range.
Contrary to the variational result, however, we do not find any evidence of the
chiral phase. The range of the chiral phase, if any, is estimated to be less
than 0.1% in the temperature width.

the nature of the lasing modes in these so-called lasers with resonant
feedback. In this paper, we review numerical and theoretical studies aimed at
clarifying the nature of the lasing modes in disordered scattering systems with
gain. We will discuss in particular the link between random laser modes near
threshold (TLM) and the resonances or quasi-bound (QB) states of the passive
system without gain. For random lasers in the localized regime, QB states and
threshold lasing modes were found to be nearly identical within the scattering
medium. These studies were later extended to the case of more lossy systems
such as random systems in the diffusive regime where differences between
quasi-bound states and lasing modes were measured. Very recently, a theory able
to treat lasers with arbitrarily complex and open cavities such as random
lasers established that the TLM are better described in terms of the so-called

characterize deviations from statistical isotropy in Cosmic Microwave
Background maps. Application to the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data
clearly shows differences between the northern and the southern hemispheres.
The sill and range of the northern hemisphere's variogram are lower than those
of the southern hemisphere. Moreover the variogram for the northern hemisphere
lies outside the 99% c.l. for scales above ten degrees. Differences between the
northern and southern hemispheres in the functional dependence of the variogram
with the scale can be used as a validation bench mark for proposed anisotropic
cosmological models.

the anisotropy and polarization of the Cosmic Background Radiation with a

design, development and performance of the eleven Flight Model OMTs of LFI. The
final design was reached after several years of development. At first, Elegant
Bread Board OMTs were produced to investigate the manufacturing technology and

perspective which embodies the mathematical formalism of standard (Hilbert

quantum probabilities as conditional instead of absolute. We provide in this
review an overall view on the present status of our research on this topic. We
attain in a new, shortened way a mathematical representation of the generalized
observables introduced by the ESR model and a generalization of the projection
postulate of elementary QM. Basing on these results we prove that the
Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (BCHSH) inequality, a modified BCHSH inequality
and quantum predictions hold together in the ESR model because they refer to
different parts of the picture of the physical world supplied by the model.
Then we show that a new mathematical representation of mixtures must be
introduced in the ESR model which does not coincide with the standard
representation in QM and avoids some deep problems that arise from the
representation of mixtures provided by QM. Finally we get a nontrivial
generalization of the Luders postulate, which is justified in a special case by
introducing a reasonable physical assumption on the evolution of the compound
system made up of the measured system and the measuring apparatus.

stationary Gaussian process in noise, using a large wireless sensor network
(WSN). In our model, each sensor compresses its observation sequence using a
linear precoder. The final decision is taken by a fusion center (FC) based on
the compressed information. Two families of precoders are studied: random iid
precoders and orthogonal precoders. We analyse their performance in the regime
where both the number of sensors k and the number of samples n per sensor tend
to infinity at the same rate, that is, k/n tends to c in (0, 1). Contributions
are as follows. 1) Using results of random matrix theory and on large Toeplitz
matrices, it is proved that the miss probability of the Neyman-Pearson detector
converges exponentially to zero, when the above families of precoders are used.
Closed form expressions of the corresponding error exponents are provided. 2)
In particular, we propose a practical orthogonal precoding strategy, the
Principal Frequencies Strategy (PFS), which achieves the best error exponent
among all orthogonal strategies, and which requires very few signaling overhead
between the central processor and the nodes of the network. 3) Moreover, when
the PFS is used, a simplified low-complexity testing procedure can be
implemented at the FC. We show that the proposed suboptimal test enjoys the
same error exponent as the Neyman-Pearson test, which indicates a similar
asymptotic behaviour of the performance. We illustrate our findings by
numerical experiments on some examples.

As
a method we use the local-density approximation+dynamical mean-field theory. We
show the following. (i) The Mott transition is driven by the change in
structure from long to short c-axis layered perovskite (L-Pbca to S-Pbca); it
occurs together with orbital order, which follows, rather than produces, the
structural transition. (ii) In the metallic L-Pbca phase the orbital
polarization is ~0. (iii) In the insulating S-Pbca phase the lower energy
orbital, ~xy, is full. (iv) The spin-flip and pair-hopping Coulomb terms reduce
the effective masses in the metallic phase. Our results indicate that a similar
scenario applies to Ca_{2-x}Sr_xRuO_4 (x<0.2). In the metallic x< 0.5
structures electrons are progressively transferred to the xz/yz bands with
increasing x, however we find no orbital-selective Mott transition down to ~300
K.

the two parts is made with rectangular Wave Guides. Considerations of different
nature (thermal, electromagnetic and mechanical), imposed stringent
requirements on the WGs characteristics and drove their design. From the
thermal point of view, the WG should guarantee good insulation between the FEM

is essential that the signals do not undergo excessive attenuation through the
WG. Finally, given the different positions of the FEM modules behind the focal
surface and the mechanical constraints given by the surrounding structures,
different mechanical designs were necessary. A composite configuration of
Stainless Steel and Copper was selected to satisfy all the requirements. Given
the complex shape and the considerable length (about 1.5-2 m), manufacturing

the LFI WGs, including the choice of the final configuration and of the

devoid of luminous galaxies. This is in concordance with the formation of the

However, the numerical results indicate that cosmological voids are abundantly
populated with dark matter haloes which may in principle host dwarf galaxies.
Observational efforts have in contrast revealed, that voids are apparently
devoid of dwarf galaxies. We investigate the formation of dwarf galaxies in
voids by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Due to the cosmic
ultra-violet background radiation low-mass haloes show generally are reduced
baryon fraction. We determine the characteristic mass below which dwarf
galaxies are baryon deficient. We show that the circular velocity below which
the accretion of baryons is suppressed is approximately 40 km/s. The suppressed
baryon accretion is caused by the photo-heating due to the UV-background. We
set up a spherical halo model and show that the effective equation of state of
the gas in the periphery of dwarf galaxies determines the characteristic mass.
This implies that any process which heats the gas around dwarf galaxies
increases the characteristic mass and thus reduces the number of observable
dwarf galaxies.

We study the Weyl equation in the stationary setting, i.e. when the spinor
field oscillates harmonically in time. We suggest a new geometric
interpretation of the stationary Weyl equation, one which does not require the
use of spinors, Pauli matrices or covariant differentiation. We think of our
3-dimensional space as an elastic continuum and assume that material points of
this continuum can experience no displacements, only rotations. This framework
is a special case of the Cosserat theory of elasticity. Rotations of material
points of the space continuum are described mathematically by attaching to each
geometric point an orthonormal basis which gives a field of orthonormal bases
called the coframe. As the dynamical variables (unknowns) of our theory we
choose the coframe and a density. We choose a particular potential energy which
is conformally invariant and then incorporate time into our action in the
standard Newtonian way, by subtracting kinetic energy. The main result of our
paper is the theorem stating that in the stationary setting our model is
equivalent to a pair of Weyl equations. The crucial element of the proof is the
observation that our Lagrangian admits a factorization.
