cannot perceive because the energy required to excite modes in the extra
directions is too high. Many examples are known of such manifolds with a large
volume and a large mass gap. These compactifications can help explain the
weakness of four-dimensional gravity and, as we show here, they also have the
capacity to produce reasonable potentials for an inflaton field. Modeling the
inflaton as a bulk scalar field, it becomes very weakly coupled in four
dimensions, and this enables us to build phenomenologically acceptable
inflationary models with tunings at the few per mil level. We speculate on dark
matter candidates and the possibility of braneless models in this setting.

closed-form expressions for the critical frontier with applications to various
lattice models. For the triangular-type lattices Wu's result is exact, and for
the kagome-type lattices Wu's expression is under a homogeneity assumption. The
purpose of the present paper is two-fold: First, an essential step in Wu's
analysis is the derivation of lattice-dependent constants $A, B, C$ for various
lattice models, a process which can be tedious. We present here a derivation of
these constants for subnet networks using a computer algorithm. Secondly, by
means of a finite-size scaling analysis based on numerical transfer matrix
calculations, we deduce critical properties and critical thresholds of various
models and assess the accuracy of the homogeneity assumption. Specifically, we
analyze the $q$-state Potts model and the bond percolation on the 3-12 and
kagome-type subnet lattices $(n\times n):(n\times n)$, $n\leq 4$, for which the
exact solution is not known. To calibrate the accuracy of the finite-size
procedure, we apply the same numerical analysis to models for which the exact
critical frontiers are known. The comparison of numerical and exact results
shows that our numerical determination of critical thresholds is accurate to 7
or 8 significant digits. This in turn infers that the homogeneity assumption
determines critical frontiers with an accuracy of 5 decimal places or higher.
Finally, we also obtained the exact percolation thresholds for site percolation
on kagome-type subnet lattices $(1\times 1):(n\times n)$ for $1\leq n \leq 6$.

$\rho_X\propto \rho_{m} a^{\xi}$ (Dalal et al.2001), we discuss the cosmic
coincidence problem in light of current observational data. $\xi$ is a key
parameter to denote the severity of the coincidence problem. In this scenario,
$\xi=3$ and $\xi=0$ correspond to $\Lambda$CDM and the self-similar solution
without coincidence problem, respectively. Hence, any solution with a scaling
parameter $0<\xi<3$ makes the coincidence problem less severe. In addition, the
standard cosmology without interaction between DE and DM is characterized by
$\xi+3\omega_X=0$, whereas the inequality $\xi+3\omega_X\neq 0$ represents
non-standard cosmology. We place observational constraints on the parameters
$(\Omega_{X,0},\omega_{X},\xi)$ of this model, by using the Constitution Set,
the CMB shift parameter from the 5-year WMAP and the SDSS baryon acoustic peak.
Combining the three samples, we get $\Omega_{X,0}=0.72\pm0.02$,
$\omega_{X}=-0.98\pm0.07$ and $\xi=3.06\pm0.35$ at 68.3% confidence level. The
result shows that the $\Lambda$CDM model still remains a good fit to the recent
observational data, as well as, the coincidence problem indeed exists and is
quite severe, in the framework of this simple phenomenological model. We
further constrain the model with the transition redshift (deceleration /
acceleration). It shows that if the transition from deceleration to
acceleration happens at the redshit $z > 0.73$, within the framework of this
model, we can conclude that the interaction between DE and DM is necessary.

the droplet that results, in the percolating phase, from conditioning the

circuit Gamma_0 encircling the origin and enclosing an area of at least (or
exactly) n^2. (By the Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation, the model is a close
relative of the droplet formed by conditioning the Potts model on an excess of
spins of a given type.) We consider local deviation of the droplet boundary,
measured in a radial sense by the maximum local roughness, MLR(Gamma_0), this
being the maximum distance from a point in the circuit Gamma_0 to the boundary
of the circuit's convex hull; and in a longitudinal sense by what we term
maximum facet length, MFL(Gamma_0), namely, the length of the longest line
segment of which the boundary of the convex hull is formed. The principal
conclusion of the series of papers is the following uniform control on local
deviation: that there are positive constants c and C such that the conditional
probability that the normalised quantity n^{-1/3}\big(\log n \big)^{-2/3}
MLR(Gamma_0) lies in the interval [c,C] tends to 1 in the high n-limit; and
that the same statement holds for n^{-2/3}\big(\log n \big)^{-1/3}
MFL(Gamma_0). In this way, we confirm the anticipated n^{1/3} scaling of
maximum local roughness, and provide a sharp logarithmic power-law correction.
This local deviation behaviour occurs by means of locally Gaussian effects
constrained globally by curvature, and we believe that it arises in a range of
radially defined stochastic interface models, including several in the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. This paper is devoted to proving the
upper bounds in these assertions, and includes a heuristic overview of the
surgical technique used in the three papers.

decrease power consumption and speed up performance of next-generation optical
telecommunications networks. Nonlinear optical effects, such as four-wave
mixing (FWM) and parametric gain, have long been explored to realize
all-optical functions in glass fibers. An alternative approach is to employ
nanoscale engineering of silicon waveguides to enhance the optical
nonlinearities by up to five orders of magnitude, enabling integrated
chip-scale all-optical signal processing. Previously, strong two-photon
absorption (TPA) of the telecom-band pump has been a fundamental and
unavoidable obstacle, limiting parametric gain to values on the order of a few
dB. Here we demonstrate a silicon nanophotonic optical parametric amplifier
exhibiting gain as large as 25.4 dB, by operating the pump in the mid-IR near
one-half the band-gap energy (E~0.55eV, lambda~2200nm), at which parasitic
TPA-related absorption vanishes. This gain is high enough to compensate all
insertion losses, resulting in 13 dB net off-chip amplification. Furthermore,
dispersion engineering dramatically increases the gain bandwidth to more than
220 nm, all realized using an ultra-compact 4 mm silicon chip. Beyond its
significant relevance to all-optical signal processing, the broadband
parametric gain also facilitates the simultaneous generation of multiple
on-chip mid-IR sources through cascaded FWM, covering a 500 nm spectral range.
Together, these results provide a foundation for the construction of
silicon-based room-temperature mid-IR light sources including tunable
chip-scale parametric oscillators, optical frequency combs, and supercontinuum
generators.

how the macroscopic advective response to flow and the microscopic dissipative

model involving a clear probabilistic interpretation from the very beginning is
provided by the quantum logics with unique conditional probabilities. It
includes the projection lattices in von Neumann algebras and here probability
conditionalization becomes identical with the state transition of the Lueders -
von Neumann measurement process. This motivates the definition of a hierarchy
of five compatibility and comeasurability levels in the abstract setting of the
quantum logics with unique conditional probabilities. Their meanings are: the
absence of quantum interference or influence, the existence of a joint
distribution, simultaneous measurability, and the independence of the final
state after two successive measurements from the sequential order of these two
measurements. A further level means that two elements of the quantum logic
(events) belong to the same Boolean subalgebra. In the general case, the five
compatibility and comeasurability levels appear to differ, but they all
coincide in the common Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics, in von
Neumann algebras, and in some other cases.

(the inverse of the von Klitzing constant), e the charge of the electron and h
Planck constant. This forces the charge of the electron e to be constant as
long as the action h (an angular momentum) is a true constant too. From the
constancy of the Rydberg constant the Compton wavelength, h/mc, is then a true
constant and consequently there is no expansion at the quantum mechanical
level. The momentum mc is also a true constant and then general relativity
predicts that the universe is not expanding, as shown elsewhere. The time
variation of the speed of light explains the observed Hubble red shift. And
there is a mass-boom effect. From this a coherent cosmological system of
constant units can be defined.

this multivalued perturbation comes from the Filippov regularization of a

progenitor, a spherically symmetric effective general relativistic potential,
the Lattimer-Swesty or the Shen equation of state (EoS), and a neutrino
parametrisation scheme which is accurate until about 5ms postbounce. For 3
representative models, we also include long-term neutrino physics by means of a
leakage scheme. Non- or only slowly rotating models show GW emission due to
prompt and proto-neutron star convection, allowing the distinction between the
two different nuclear EoS. For moderately or fast rotation rates models, we
find, in agreement with recent results, only a type I GW signature at core
bounce. Models which are set up with an initial central angular velocity of >~
2pi rad/s emit GWs due to the low T/|W| dynamical instability during the
postbounce phase. Weak B-fields do not notably influence the dynamical
evolution of the core and thus the GW emission. However, for strong initial
poloidal B-fields (~1e12 G),flux-freezing and field winding leads to conditions
where P_{mag}/P_{mat} ~ 1, causing the onset of a jet-like supernova explosion
and hence the emission of a type IV GW signal. In contradiction to axisymmetric
simulations, we find evidence that nonaxisymmetric fluid modes can counteract
or even suppress jet formation for models with strong initial toroidal
B-fields. We point out that the inclusion of the deleptonisation during the
postbounce phase is an indispensable issue for the quantitative prediction of
GWs from core-collapse supernovae, as it can alter the GW amplitude up to a
factor of 10 compared to a pure hydrodynamical treatment.

peak flux of the 2007 outburst of GX 339-4, clarified issues about faint
flares, and estimated the lower limit of hard X-ray peak flux for the next
outburst. Methods. We included Swift/BAT data obtained in the past four years.
Together with the CGRO/BATSE and RXTE/HEXTE light curves, the observations used
in this work cover a period of 18 years. Results. The observation of the 2007
outburst confirms the empirical relation discovered before. This strengthens
the apparent link between the mass in the accretion disk and the peak
luminosity of the brightest hard state that the black hole transient can reach.
We also show that faint flares with peak fluxes smaller than about 0.12 crab do
not affect the empirical relation. We predict that the hard X-ray peak flux of
the next outburst should be larger than 0.65 crab, which will make it at least
the second brightest in the hard X-ray since 1991.

symbol-wise decoding, where the errors in other symbol estimates do not affect
the result, thus providing an optimality that is worth pursuing. Another
beneficial property is a low complexity soft decision decoder, which for
orthogonal complex MIMO codes is known for two transmit (Tx) antennas i.e. for
the Alamouti code. We propose novel soft decision decoders for the orthogonal
complex MIMO codes on three and four Tx antennas and extend the old result of
maximal ratio combining (MRC) to cover all orthogonal codes up to four Tx
antennas.
  As a rule, a sophisticated transmission scheme encompasses forward error
correction (FEC) coding, and its performance is measured at the FEC decoder
instead of at the MIMO decoder. We introduce the receiver structure that
delivers the MIMO decoder's soft decisions to the demodulator, which in turn
cranks out the logarithm of likelihood ratio (LLR) of each bit and delivers
them to the FEC decoder. This makes a significant improvement on the receiver,
where a maximum likelihood (ML) MIMO decoder makes hard decisions at a too
early stage. Further, the additional gain is achieved with stunningly low
complexity.

time-dependent radiative output from internal shocks arising from colliding
relativistic shells in a blazar jet. The emission through synchrotron and
synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) radiation as well as Comptonization of an
isotropic external radiation field are taken into account. We evaluate the
discrete correlation function (DCF) of the model light curves in order to
evaluate features of photon-energy dependent time lags and the quality of the
correlation, represented by the peak value of the DCF. The almost completely
analytic nature of our approach allows us to study in detail the influence of
various model parameters on the resulting spectral and timing features. This
paper focuses on a range of parameters in which the gamma-ray production is
dominated by Comptonization of external radiation, most likely appropriate for
gamma-ray bright flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) or low-frequency peaked BL
Lac objects (LBLs). In most cases relevant for FSRQs and LBLs, the variability
of the optical emission is highly correlated with the X-ray and high-energy
(HE: > 100 MeV) gamma-ray emission. Our baseline model predicts a lead of the
optical variability with respect to the higher-energy bands by 1 - 2 hours and
of the HE gamma-rays before the X-rays by about 1 hour. We show that variations
of certain parameters may lead to changing signs of inter-band time lags,
potentially explaining the lack of persistent trends of time lags in most
blazars.

multiple testing is that of estimating the null density and the proportion of
nonnull effects. A few estimators have been introduced in the literature;
however, several important problems, including the evaluation of the minimax
rate of convergence and the construction of rate-optimal estimators, remain
open. In this paper, we consider optimal estimation of the null density and the
proportion of nonnull effects. Both minimax lower and upper bounds are derived.
The lower bound is established by a two-point testing argument, where at the
core is the novel construction of two least favorable marginal densities $f_1$
and $f_2$. The density $f_1$ is heavy tailed both in the spatial and frequency
domains and $f_2$ is a perturbation of $f_1$ such that the characteristic
functions associated with $f_1$ and $f_2$ match each other in low frequencies.
The minimax upper bound is obtained by constructing estimators which rely on
the empirical characteristic function and Fourier analysis. The estimator is
shown to be minimax rate optimal. Compared to existing methods in the
literature, the proposed procedure not only provides more precise estimates of
the null density and the proportion of the nonnull effects, but also yields
more accurate results when used inside some multiple testing procedures which
aim at controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR). The procedure is easy to
implement and numerical results are given.

the fundamental cyclotron resonance energy changed from ~22 to ~27 keV in a
clear anti-correlation to the source luminosity, and without any hysteresis
effects between the rising and declining phases of the outburst. In contrast,
the second harmonic energy changed from ~49 to ~54 keV, implying a weaker
fractional change as a function of the luminosity. As a result, the observed
resonance energy ratio between the second harmonic and the fundamental was ~2.2
when the source was most luminous, whereas the ratio decreased to the nominal

acknowledges that information and beliefs are subjective. Market prices can be
translated into implied probabilities. In particular, futures imply returns for

but uncertainty. Non-normal distributions combine the risk in the left tail
with the opportunities in the right tail -- unifying the ""risk premium"" with
the possible loss. Risk and reward must be part of the same picture and
expected returns must include possible losses due to risks. We reinterpret the
Black-Scholes pricing formulas as prices for maximum-entropy probability
distributions, illuminating their importance from a new angle. Using these
ideas we show how derivatives can be priced under ""uncertain uncertainty"" and
how this creates a skew for the implied volatilities. We argue that the current
standard approach based on stochastic modelling and risk-neutral pricing fails
to account for subjectivity in markets and mistreats uncertainty as risk.
Furthermore, it is founded on a questionable argument -- that uncertainty is
eliminated at all cost.

Single dust grains, which follow gas flows in the protoplanetary disc, hit each

centimetre size. The mechanism of further growth is unclear since the outcome
of aggregate collisions in the relevant velocity and size regime cannot be
investigated in the laboratory under protoplanetary disc conditions. Realistic
statistics of the result of dust aggregate collisions beyond decimetre size is
missing for a deeper understanding of planetary growth. Joining experimental
and numerical efforts we want to calibrate and validate a computer program that
is capable of a correct simulation of the macroscopic behaviour of highly
porous dust aggregates. After testing its numerical limitations thoroughly we
will check the program especially for a realistic reproduction of various
benchmark experiments. We adopt the smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
numerical scheme with extensions for the simulation of solid bodies and a
modified version of the Sirono porosity model. Experimentally measured
macroscopic material properties of silica dust are implemented. We calibrate
and test for the compressive strength relation and the bulk modulus. SPH has
already proven to be a suitable tool to simulate collisions at rather high
velocities. In this work we demonstrate that its area of application can not
only be extended to low-velocity experiments and collisions. It can also be
used to simulate the behaviour of highly porous objects in this velocity regime
to a very high accuracy.The result of the calibration process in this work is
an SPH code that can be utilised to investigate the collisional outcome of

substellar objects and stars with masses larger than ~M_{sun} have been ruled
out as major components of a Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Object (MACHO)
Galactic halo, while stars of half a solar mass seem to be viable candidates.
Main sequence stars have been already discarded, and there are tight
restrictions on the role played by white dwarfs with hydrogen-dominated
atmospheres. In this paper we evaluate the contribution to the dark matter
content of the Galaxy of white dwarfs with hydrogen-deficient atmospheres. For
this purpose we use a Monte Carlo simulator which incorporates up-to-date
evolutionary sequences of white dwarfs with hydrogen-rich and
hydrogen-deficient atmospheres. We also take into account detailed descriptions
of the thick disk and the halo of our Galaxy as well as of a reliable model of
the LMC. We find that the contribution of white dwarfs with hydrogen-deficient
atmospheres moderately increases the theoretical estimate of the optical depth
with respect to the value obtained when only hydrogen-rich white dwarfs are
considered. We also find that the contribuiton of the thick disk population of
white dwarfs is comparable to the halo contribution. However, the contributions
of both the halo and the thick disk white-dwarf populations are still
insufficient to explain the number of events observed by the MACHO team.
Finally, we find that the contribution to the halo dark matter of the entire
population under study is less than 10% at the 95% conficence level.

spectral inversion techniques that have been used to infer the plasma
parameters important for the general properties of the prominence plasma in
both its cool core and the hotter prominence-corona transition region. We also
review studies devoted to the observation of bulk motions of the prominence
plasma and to the determination of prominence mass. However, a simple inversion
of spectroscopic data usually fails when the lines become optically thick at
certain wavelengths. Therefore, complex non-LTE models become necessary. We
thus present the basics of non-LTE radiative transfer theory and the associated
multi-level radiative transfer problems. The main results of one- and
two-dimensional models of the prominences and their fine-structures are
presented. We then discuss the energy balance in various prominence models.
Finally, we outline the outstanding observational and theoretical questions,

calculate the radio-loud fraction, we find that this misses the majority of the
radio detected galaxies in the sample. We determine integrated radio-to-X-ray
flux ratios for the galaxies, GRx, which are shown to span a large range
(factor of 100). We calculate the mass-weighted cooling times within 1 kpc, and
find hints for an anticorrelation with the radio luminosity. We also calculate
limits on k/f, where k is the ratio of the total particle energy to that of
relativistic electrons radiating in the range 10 MHz-10 GHz and f is the volume
filling factor of the plasma in the cavity. The k/f distribution is also broad,
reflecting previous results for larger galaxy clusters. Lowering the X-ray flux
limit, at the expense of less complete VLA and Chandra coverage, increases the
size of our sample to 42 galaxies. Nuclear radio activity is detected in at
least 34/42 of this extended sample.

fits very well into the pattern of the radial Regge trajectory. Furthermore, we
point out that the pion and nucleon spin-0 gravitational form factors, recently
measured on the lattice, provide valuable information on the low-mass spectrum
of the scalar-isoscalar states on the basis of the scalar-meson dominance in
the spin-0 channel. Through the fits to these data we find m_sigma= 450-600
MeV. We compare the predictions of various fits and methods. An analysis of the
QCD condensates in the two-point correlators provides further constraints on
the parameters of the scalar-isoscalar sector. We find that a simple two-state
model suggests a meson nature of f0(600), and a glueball nature of f0(980),
which naturally explains the ratios of various coupling constants. Finally, we
note that the fine-tuned condition of the vanishing dimension-2 condensate in
the Regge approach with infinitely many scalar-isoscalar states yields a
reasonable value for the mass of the lighest glueball state.

(RV) signatures. Because even low activity stars would produce such a signal,
it is crucial to determine how it influences our ability to detect small
planetary signals such as those produced by Earth-mass planets in the habitable
zone (HZ). In a recent paper, we investigated the impact of sunlike spots. We
aim here to investigate the additional impact of plages. We used the spot and
plage properties over a solar cycle to derive the RV that would be observed if
the Sun was seen edge-on. The RV signal comes from the photometric contribution
of spots and plages and from the attenuation of the convective blueshift in
plages. We compared the RV signal with the signal that would be produced by an
Earth-mass planet in the HZ. We find that the photometric contributions of
spots and plages to the RV signal partially balance each other out, so that the
residual signal is comparable to the spot signal. However, the plage
contribution due to the convective blueshift attenuation dominates the total
signal, with an amplitude over the solar cycle of about 8-10 m/s. This
contribution is very strongly correlated with the Ca index on the long term,
which may be a way to distinguish between stellar activity and a planet.
Providing a very good temporal sampling and signal-to-noise ratio, the
photometric contribution of plages and spots should not prevent detection of
Earth-mass planets in the HZ. However, the convection contribution makes such a
direct detection impossible, unless its effect can be corrected for by methods
that still need to be found. We show that it is possible to identify the
convection contribution if the sensitivity is good enough, for example, by
using activity indicators.

tree-dimensional physical parameters of both dark matter (DM) and intra-cluster
medium (ICM) for the galaxy cluster Abell 1689. We exploit the novel method we
recently introduced (Morandi et al. 2010) in order to infer the
tree-dimensional physical properties in triaxial galaxy clusters by combining
jointly X-ray and strong lensing data. We find that Abell 1689 can be modeled
as a triaxial galaxy cluster with DM halo axial ratios 1.24 +/- 0.13 and 2.37
+/- 0.11 on the plane of the sky and along the line of sight, respectively. We
show that accounting for the three-dimensional geometry allows to solve the
discrepancy between the mass determined from X-ray and strong gravitational
lensing observations. We also determined the inner slope of the DM density
profile alpha: we measure alpha = 0.90 +/- 0.05 by accounting explicitly for
the 3D structure for this cluster, a value which is close to the cold dark
matter (CDM) predictions, while the standard spherical modeling leads to the
biased value alpha = 1.16 +/- 0.04. Our findings dispel the potential
inconsistencies arisen in the literature between the predictions of the CDM
scenario and the observations, providing further evidences that support the CDM
scenario.

frustration. Powder neutron diffraction, heat capacity, susceptibility, muon
spin relaxation(_SR), and 89Y NMR- including MAS NMR- data have been collected.
La2LiMoO6 deviates strongly from simple Curie-Weiss paramagnetic behavior below
150K and zero-field cooled/ field cooled (ZFC/FC)irreversibility occurs below
20K with a weak, broad susceptibility maximum near 5K in the ZFC data. A
Curie-Weiss fit shows a reduced mu_eff=1.42\mu_B, (spin only = 1.73 muB) and a
Weiss temperature, \theta_c, which depends strongly on the temperature range of
the fit. Powder neutron diffraction, heat capacity and 7Li NMR show no evidence
for long range magnetic order to 2K. On the other hand oscillations develop
below 20K in muSR indicating at least short range magnetic correlations.
Susceptibility data for Ba2YMoO6 also deviate strongly from the C-W law below
150K with a similarly reduced mu_eff = 1.72\mu_B and \theta_c = - 219(1)K. Heat
capacity, neutron powder diffraction and muSR data show no evidence for long
range order to 2K but a very broad maximum appears in the heat capacity. The
89Y NMR paramagnetic Knight shift shows a remarkable local spin susceptibility
behavior below about 70K with two components from roughly equal sample volumes,
one indicating a singlet state and the other a strongly fluctuating
paramagnetic state. Further evidence for a singlet state comes from the
behavior of the relaxation rate, 1/T1. These results are discussed and compared
with those from other isostructural S = 1/2 materials and those based on S =
3/2 and S = 1.

being produced by it, and needed to calibrate the physical responses of the
detector itself are stored in ORACLE databases. The large amount of data to be
stored, the number of clients involved and the performance requirements make
the database system an essential service for the experiment to run. This note
describes the CMS condition database architecture, the data-flow and PopCon,
the tool built in order to populate the offline databases. Finally, the first
experience obtained during the 2008 and 2009 cosmic data taking are presented.

that the correct understanding of the percolation phenomenon of the
Fortuin-Kasteleyn cluster in the Edwards-Anderson model is important since a
dynamical transition, which is characterized by a parameter called the Hamming
distance or damage, and the percolation transition are related to a transition
for a signal propagating between spins. We show analytically the percolation
thresholds of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn cluster for a Potts gauge glass model,
which is an extended model of the Edwards-Anderson model, on random graphs with
arbitary degree distributions. The results are shown on the Nishimori line. We
also show the results for the infinite-range model.

operation of the online selection as well as of the offline reconstruction and
analysis of data. We will describe here the system put in place in the CMS
experiment to populate the database and make condition data promptly available
both online for the high-level trigger and offline for reconstruction. The
system, designed for high flexibility to cope with very different data sources,
uses POOL-ORA technology in order to store data in an object format that best
matches the object oriented paradigm for \texttt{C++} programming language used
in the CMS offline software. In order to ensure consistency among the various
subdetectors, a dedicated package, PopCon (Populator of Condition Objects), is
used to store data online. The data are then automatically streamed to the
offline database hence immediately accessible offline worldwide. This mechanism
was intensively used during 2008 in the test-runs with cosmic rays. The
experience of this first months of operation will be discussed in detail.

the intrinsic anisotropy of this superconductor. Untextured bulks and wires are
macroscopically isotropic, but the grains retain their anisotropic properties
and the field dependence of the critical currents is much stronger than in
isotropic superconductors. Weakly or partially textured tapes are
macroscopically anisotropic, but the anisotropy of the zero resistivity (or
irreversibility) field is smaller than the intrinsic upper critical field
anisotropy, $\gamma$. The \Jc-anisotropy is field and temperature dependent and
can be much larger than $\gamma$. The most suitable parameter for the
quantification of the macroscopic anisotropy is, therefore, the anisotropy of
the zero resistivity field. It is difficult to distinguish between a higher
degree of texture at a lower intrinsic anisotropy and a weaker texture at
higher anisotropy and hardly possible based on the field dependence of the
critical current anisotropy alone. The knowledge of the upper critical field is
crucial and angular resolved measurements of either the critical currents or,
better, the resistive in-field transitions are favorable for this purpose.

provide a convincing detection of intelligent life. In the wake of this null
signal, many ""contact pessimistic"" hypotheses have been formulated, the most
famous of which is the Rare Earth Hypothesis. It postulates that although
terrestrial planets may be common, the exact environmental conditions that
Earth enjoys are rare, perhaps unique. As a result, simple microbial life may
be common, but complex metazoans (and hence intelligence) will be rare. This
paper uses Monte Carlo Realisation Techniques to investigate the Rare Earth
Hypothesis, in particular the environmental criteria considered imperative to
the existence of intelligence on Earth.
  By comparing with a less restrictive, more optimistic hypothesis, the data
indicates that if the Rare Earth hypothesis is correct, intelligent
civilisation will indeed be relatively rare. Studying the separations of pairs
of civilisations shows that most intelligent civilisation pairs (ICPs) are
unconnected: that is, they will not be able to exchange signals at lightspeed
in the limited time that both are extant. However, the few ICPs that are
connected are strongly connected, being able to participate in numerous
exchanges of signals. This may provide encouragement for SETI researchers:
although the Rare Earth Hypothesis is in general a contact-pessimistic
hypothesis, it may be a ""soft"" or ""exclusive"" hypothesis, i.e. it may contain
facets that are latently contact-optimistic.
